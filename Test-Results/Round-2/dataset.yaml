text: ' Imran Khan s current team has formulated an election strategy that will ensure
  his elevation as the 20th Prime Minister (PM) of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
  Electives have been identified, who will contest elections on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf
  (PTI) tickets using their own resources to get elected and will then elect Imran
  Khan as their leader in the National Assembly. Imran Khan has extensive experience
  in cricket team selection and building it into a winning combination. In politics,
  this is an interesting approach which relies totally on the capability of the electiveswhich
  have never played with neutral umpires. Over the years, PML-N has been able to formulate
  an effective election mechanism to win elections; PTI candidates will be up against
  this roguery. Politics in Pakistan has been dominated by Lahore launched parties
  (PPP, PTI, MP, etc). Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto mobilised the voters and created a nationwide
  (West Pakistan) organisational structure. Due to his progressive agenda, the entire
  left and labour supported him. Ayub Khan s electable without the supportof the state
  apparatus had to bite the dust, the will of the people prevailed in the 1970 elections.
  His government was rightly termed as  Awami Hukomat  (People s Government). By the
  next elections in 1977 ZAB fell into the trap of the electable despite his personal
  popularity. It was disrespect of the ballot by a few influential that sparked the
  Pakistan National Alliance (PNA) movement that not only toppled him but was also
  responsible for Zia s deadly martial law. With elections not too far away, Imran
  Khan seems relaxed and confident on the success of this strategy. Coming into power
  is a pre-requisite to introduce achange that he desires. It will be very interesting
  to implement an anti-status-quo agenda through the electives if they manage to make
  it to the parliament. In the political arena, IK is a ray of hope for the nation.
  He stands for accountability and clean politics. His coming into power will result
  in a significant shift and much-needed process correction. The strategy of the electives
  has two significant challenges. Firstly, can it ensure electoral victory; and secondly,
  will IK be able to deliver with a non-performing team who have a track record of
  status-quo politics? Electability is tied with manipulative democracy which has
  been the domain of PML-N. Will PTI electives be able to prevail over the ruling
  party rogues, only time will tell. As a leader, IK has to decide which course to
  follow. It seems he has been convinced to take the electability route. After ZAB,
  Imran Khan is the most popular national leader who has to be turned into electoral
  victory. Till October 2011, PTI emerged as a voice of the masses. Its organisational
  structure was growing. It was the first political party to have a shadow cabinet,
  think tanks and a very effective first 100 days  plan. IK is committedto creating
  a welfare state, and policies were formulated to support this vision. Policy presentations
  were arranged which were followed by open debate and discussion. Youth were trained
  and encouraged to lead. It was Imran Khan s approach to have elected leadership
  for which Inter-Party Elections (IPEs) were also held. Today, PTI has two decks,
  upper and lower. The boundaries between them are very clearly defined. Some lower
  deck members have managed to sit on the upper deck, but their voices are not heard.
  It is the upper deck that runs the show. In the recent March on Islamabad, the two
  decks were unable to put a combined resistance. Sheikh Rashid with his Tonga Party  stole
  the show with his wily demonstration of street politics. Electives belong to the
  upper deck of the party. If by any chance the upper deck electivesprevail over the
  roguery of PML-N how will they govern? Will they employ the  Shahbaz Sharif model  and
  operate through the Baboos who have been loyal to the Takht-e-Lahore for decades?
  The upper deck will then be isolated. IK continues to be a link between the two
  decks. Despite the isolation, the lower deck continues to look upto their Kaptaan.  For
  Kaptaan to lead the crusade for  Naya Pakistan  he needs complete support of the
  party. Both the upper and lower decks have to operate in unison. In KPK, despite
  the best efforts of IK, the upper deck government has not been able to perform to
  its full potential. Approved party policies have not been fully implemented in the
  province which could have resulted in a complete turnaround. Party unity is severely
  strained which is not a healthy sign. Electives do play a role in certain constituencies
  due to their influence and lineage but are unable to deliver at the national level
  as their appeal is only local and confined as they lack mass appeal. Change is inevitable
  as status-quo is no longer an option. As a party, PTI has all the ingredients for
  success. Once it enjoyed an overwhelming support of the masses which was demonstrated
  on October 30, 2011, at Minar-e-Pakistan, where once Quaid stood to present the
  resolution for the new homeland. It was here that Kaptaan announced the revival
  of Quaid s Pakistan which he termed as  Naya Pakistan . He is both close and far
  in realising his dream. It is a test of his leadership. ZAB emerged as the first
  elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, and his political legacy lives on. On the other
  hand, Air Marshal Asghar Khan had his days but will be remembered as a spoiler of
  democracy. His Tehreek-e-Istiqlal is nowhere to be seen. Imran Khan and his Tehreek-e-Insaf
  can come into power if his party decks are unified   it is the undeniable lesson
  of history.   The writer is Ex-Chairman, Pakistan Science Foundation. He can be

text: ' The protests last Sunday in Russia which aroused such euphoria in the western
  media have died down, but this may be a temporary pause in the outburst of a people
  simmering with revulsion against the conditions of life in a country riddled with
  worsening socio economic crisis. This new upsurge of protest demonstrations was
  the most significant since the 2012 movement that challenged Putin s rule. But the
  harshness of the regime towards the protests with hundreds of people arrested suggested
  that Mr Putin s government was taking no chances. However, the concerns of the western
  imperialists and their seething hatred towards Putin do not spring from any real
  sympathy for the exploited masses and the perils of the autocratic rule they have
  to endure. The collapse of the Soviet Union, restoration of capitalism in Russia
  and the rise of Putin since 2000 have had contradictory responses from the western
  strategists. They were euphoric at the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall
  of the Berlin Wall. They had won the cold war; a new world order of capitalist rulership,
  they bragged, would flourish ever after. It was  the end of history ! Remember?
  However, as Marxists had explained in advance that the emerging bourgeois regimes
  in Russia and Eastern Europe were not based on a healthy capitalist system, but
  were rather Mafiosi-style capitalist cliques, mostly former bureaucrats of the Stalinist
  administrations. Soon these regimes, particularly that of Putin, became states antagonistic
  to the western imperialists, threatening their markets and businesses with rival
  economic and geopolitical agendas. A new  cold war  began at the beginning of this
  century, with China becoming a major economic power. This superficial and contradictory
  relationship between Russia and the west created a certain notion amongst some intelligentsia
  sections in countries like Pakistan that Putin or the Russian regime were in some
  way of a progressive character and could play an anti-imperialist role. This is
  false from beginning to end. Putin represents the former  communist  bureaucrats
  that have become billionaires and plundered the Russian economy and its people.
  Vladimir V Putin is no Vladimir I Lenin. Lenin led a socialist revolution and the
  first-ever workers  state in history, that demolished feudalism and capitalism and
  broke the shackles of imperialist stranglehold. A planned economy was introduced
  that transformed Russia from Czarist primitiveness into a modern advanced society
  that surpassed Western imperialism, particularly in the field of health, education,
  science and technology. This is the centenary year of the Russian revolution, also
  known as the October revolution of 1917. The spectre of its reincarnation today
  is haunting the politicians and strategists of crisis-ridden imperialism. Putin
  is no less terrified at the prospect of its recurrence; hence even the small protests
  last Sunday jolted his regime. Under Putin s control, the Kremlin plans to sit out
  the centenary of the Russian Revolution. Capitalist restoration in Russia has wrecked
  havoc in society, and the working classes and the oppressed have suffered the  fruits  of
  the market and free enterprise corporate capitalism. Ordinary Russians have been
  hit hard. Even the high growth rates do not raise the living standards of society
  in present-day capitalism anywhere! The World Bank says that 2017 it will be the
  largest increase in poverty since the economic collapse of 1998-1999. Forty-seven
  percent of the population consider themselves  the working poor.  However the ratings
  of Vladimir Putin have been astonishingly high: between 80 and 90 percent. With
  no real opposition and Russia s present communist party under Gennady Zyuganov has
  capitulated Putin doesn t seem to have a serious challenge. He has used the Russian
  chauvinism of Czarist times to boost his support. The interventions in Ukraine and
  the annexation of the Crimea enhanced his popularity. His anti-American rhetoric
  added fuel to his nationalist pretensions. But the election of Donald Trump as president
  of the US has also played into this dynamic by depriving Putin of this distraction
  tool for the masses.   However Artyom Troitsky, a Russian journalist said that the
  fact that so many young people took part in the protests in Moscow and elsewhere  is
  exceptionally important  Young people have always been a catalyst for change and
  their presence suggests a break from the lack of political interest they had exhibited
  in recent years  This does not necessarily mean that the tide has turned but something
  is definitely changing . The present Kremlin regime in the past had skillfully created
  a youth alternative in the form of a pro-Putin youth movement called Nashi is now
  worried about waning of Putin s support amongst the youth. The reality is that there
  is a limit to the foreign adventures that Putin can embark upon to whip up domestic
  support. National chauvinism cannot be stretched beyond certain limits. If capitalism
  in the advanced capitalist countries cannot develop society, it has much less potential
  to bring any respite for the Russian masses under a crony- and crime-infested regime.
  New upheavals can erupt suddenly as if out of the blue in this intensifying social
  crisis. Such a movement in the centenary year of the greatest revolution in human
  history can have a world-ranging impact and, arising from the land of October, it
  can develop into a revolutionary wave that would sweep this rotten capitalist system
  across Russia and far beyond.   The writer is the editor of Asian Marxist Review

text: 'MADRID: A second half double from Karim Benzema helped Real Madrid to a 4-1
  victory at Girona on Sunday and maintain their perfect La Liga start in the post-Cristiano
  Ronaldo era. Sergio Ramos and Gareth Bale also netted for Julen Lopetegui s European
  champions, who appear to have put the disappointment of their Super Cup defeat to
  neighbours Atletico Madrid earlier this month behind them.  We were trying to force
  things in the first half attack-wise and misplacing too many passes,  Lopetegui
  said.  Of course, you play better when the scoreboard is in your favour.  Girona
  pressured us in the first half, making life difficult for us and the side showed
  their collective mentality to come through it.  The side is functioning and when
  they do so, goals come. The important thing is that we score goals, not who scores
  them.  After seeing Benzema denied by a linesman s flag in the opening stages, Real
  were given an early scare and found themselves behind after 17 minutes when former
  B-team player Borja Garcia put the Catalans in front with a composed finish. Real
  were indebted to a number of fine saves from goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who was selected
  ahead of new signing Thibaut Courtois, as Eusebio Sacristan s side looked to double
  their advantage. However, Girona were made to pay for their profligacy when Marc
  Muniesa felled Marco Asensio in the box just before half time. Ramos coolly chipped
  the ball into the roof of the net from the ensuing penalty and from then on it was
  one-way traffic. Benzema was twice thwarted by Girona stopper Bono following the
  restart, however, he was not to be denied when Asensio won another spot kick after
  he was crudely brought down by Pere Pons. Captain Ramos allowed the France forward
  to take the kick and put Real ahead. With the home side chasing the game, Real were
  a constant threat on the counter and Bale gave a glimpse of his searing pace when
  he latched onto an Isco through ball to score in his sixth consecutive league appearance.
  Welshman Bale then set up Benzema s second from close range ten minutes from the
  end to seal victory for Real, who have maximum points after two games, while Girona
  remain on one. Earlier on Sunday, goals from Esteban Granero and Borja Iglesias
  helped Espanyol defeat Valencia 2-0. Published in Daily Times, August 28th 2018.        '

text: ' WASHINGTON: Can a cat be both liquid and solid at the same time? Have vampire
  bats developed a taste for human blood? Will holding a crocodile bolster or blunt
  your gambling drive? These questions may appear improbable, yet they are important,
  say the organisers of the annual Ig Nobel awards  for achievements that first make
  people laugh, then make them think . Researchers who invested time and money in
  solving these and other burning questions were honoured Thursday with Ig Nobels
  in 10 categories ranging from economics, anatomy and biology to fluid dynamics,
  medicine and cognition. The awards were presented at Harvard University by bemused
  laureates of the perhaps better-known Nobel Prize, which the Ig Nobels have spoofed
  since 1991, tongue firmly in cheek.  The winners this year have truly earned their
  prizes,  master of ceremonies Mark Abrahams, editor of The Annals of Improbable
  Research   a science humour magazine   told guests as he unveiled this year s statuette:
  a mannequin head with a red question mark perched on top. Winners would also receive
  $10 trillion, the presenters announced   albeit of the Zimbabwean variety. That
  sum was worth about $8 (six euros) when the bank note was issued in 2009. The theme
  of this year s Ig Nobels was  Uncertainty .   Each winner has done something that
  makes people laugh, then think,  said Abrahams. The Ig Nobel for physics went to
  French researcher Marc-Antoine Fardin for a science paper questioning:  Can a Cat
  Be Both a Solid and a Liquid?  A liquid, he explained to the audience, is something
  that can adapt its shape to the container it is in. As he spoke, photographs of
  cats in different stages of a liquid-like state, perched in vases, wine glasses
  and wash basins, flashed on a screen behind him. The study was a serious attempt
  to probe  some of the actual questions and problems that are studied in rheology,
  the study of flows,  Fardin said.  When I was asked if I was willing to accept the
  prize, the answer was easy,  he added.  It might be cool to refuse a Nobel Prize
  but it s certainly uncool to refuse an Ig Nobel.  This year s peace prize went to
  a team who investigated  Didgeridoo Playing as Alternative Treatment for Obstructive
  Sleep Apnoea Syndrome , which included a randomised controlled patient trial and
  all. The award for economics went to a US-Australian duo for experiments to discover
  whether touching a live crocodile would affect a person s willingness to gamble.
  The prize for anatomy research went to a study asking  Why Do Old Men Have Big Ears
  , while the nutrition award went to a research paper entitled:  What s for Dinner?
  First Report of Human Blood in the Diet of the Hairy-Legged Vampire Bat.  The prize
  for research into fluid dynamics, according to an Ig Nobel press statement, went
  to a project observing  the dynamics of liquid-sloshing  when a person walks backwards
  while carrying a cup of coffee. The awards are not an attempt at ridiculing science,
  the Ig Nobel website states.  Good achievements can also be odd, funny, and even
  absurd, so can bad achievements,  it explains.  A lot of good science gets attacked
  because of its absurdity. A lot of bad science gets revered despite its absurdity.           '

text: ' PHILADELPHIA (AFP)   Catastrophic engine failure on a Southwest Airlines flight
  from New York to Dallas killed one person and forced an emergency landing on Tuesday,
  the first fatal incident in US commercial aviation for nearly a decade. The Boeing
  737-700 took off without incident but minutes into the flight, passengers heard
  an explosion in the left engine, which sent shrapnel flying through the window,
  shattering the glass and leading oxygen masks to drop, witnesses said.  We believe
  there were parts coming out of this engine,  Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National
  Transportation Safety Board, told a news conference, confirming engine failure but
  no fire.  There is one fatality,  Sumwalt said. US media said seven people were
  slightly injured. The identity of the dead person was not immediately disclosed.  We
  are saying this is an engine failure,  Sumwalt said. Southwest Airlines said flight
  1380 had been en-route from New York s LaGuardia domestic airport to Dallas Love
  Field with 144 passengers and five crew members onboard. It landed at Philadelphia
  International Airport at 11:20 am (1520 GMT) after the crew reported damage to one
  of the engines, the fuselage and at least one window, the Federal Aviation Administration
  said.   The entire Southwest Airlines family is devastated and extends its deepest,
  heartfelt sympathy to the customers, employees, family members, and loved ones affected
  by this tragic event,  the company said in a statement. NBC News released a recording
  of what it identified as communications between air traffic control in Philadelphia
  and the pilot, giving dramatic insight into what witnesses called a terrifying flight.  We
  have a part of the aircraft missing, so we re going to need to slow down a bit,  said
  a woman, who appeared to be the pilot.  Use caution for the downtown area,  replies
  air traffic control.  Could you have the medical meet us there on the runway as
  well? We ve got injured passengers,  says the voice from the plane.  Is your airplane
  physically on fire?  asks air traffic control.  No, it s not on fire but part of
  it is missing. They said there is a hole and someone went out,  the pilot replies.  Something
  is wrong with our plane! It appears we are going down!  wrote passenger Marty Martinez
  on a Facebook live-stream that showed him looking panicked and breathing through
  oxygen mask.  Engine exploded in the air and blew open window 3 seats away from
  me. Explosion critically injured woman sitting in the seat next to the window,  he
  added. Shrapnel blew out a window in row 17, injuring the woman and leading to the
  immediate deployment of the oxygen masks. The woman was later stretchered off the
  plane, he said. US television footage showed the jet on the tarmac at Philadelphia
  as officials swarmed around the fuselage examining the stricken engine, manufactured
  by CFM, a joint venture between French company Safran and America s General Electric.  There
  s blood everywhere,  Martinez told CBS News, recounting his terrifying experience,
  after his live stream with the help of on board Wi-Fi.  All of a sudden we heard
  an explosion,  he told CBS.  There was a boom and within five seconds the oxygen
  masks dropped.   I thought I was cataloging the last moments of my existence,  he
  said of his Facebook transmission.  It was absolutely terrifying.  Passengers tried
  in vain to plug the hole in the window as the plane started to plummet and tilt
  in turbulence with flight attendants crying and passengers instructed to brace for
  landing, Martinez said.  It just felt like a free fall,  he said.  It was the scariest
  experience.  The woman was hit by flying shrapnel, causing her to pass out and bleed,
  Martinez told CBS. It was the first fatal incident in US commercial aviation since
  the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in February 2009, a Bombardier Dash-8 on a scheduled
  flight from Newark, New Jersey to Buffalo, New York. Fifty people were killed. Aviation
  experts drew comparisons on US television to another engine failure on a Southwest
  Airlines 737 flight from New Orleans to Orlando in 2016, which precipitated an emergency
  landing in Pensacola, Florida.  We want to look at this particular event and see
  what the factors are related to this. Maybe they re related to the previous event
  or maybe not. But we need to understand what s going on here,  said the NTSB chairman.        '

text: ' Hyderabad: Sindh Community Foundation s Tabeer program organised a seminar
  highlighting the importance of voting and the role of women in elections. A significant
  number of women, young people and laborers attended the seminar. The seminar aimed
  at educating the voters and encouraging more women to cast their votes. Javed Hussain
  of Sindh Community Foundation elaborated on the historical trajectory and importance
  of voting, highlighting that to vote is a basic democratic right of every citizen
  above the age of 18. He further stressed that female voters have a lower turn out
  in the entire country arguing that lack of literacy and voter education are the
  primary reasons for the lower turn out of women. He praised Pakistan s recently
  passed Elections Act 2017 which calls for taking special measures to increase the
  participation of women, religious minorities, trans genders and disabled persons
  in the election process. Javed added that under the Elections Act 2017 if in any
  constituency women cast their vote less than 10 per cent than the election results
  of that constituency or polling station will be suspended. He said this is good
  step by the election commission and encourages women to cast their votes because
  their votes matter. Hameed Mallah and Aisha Agha of SCF also explained the voting
  process in detail to the participants. Shahnaz Sheedi of South Asia Partnership
  Pakistan was of the view that women play a vital role in national economy but due
  to multiple reasons like gender discrimination, patriarchal mindsets and procedural
  hurdles, the female voter turnout does not increase. She emphasised that candidates
  must include women empowerment and youth development in their manifestos and they
  must follow up on their commitments after being elected. Senior journalist Khalid
  Chandio   ex president of Hyderabad press club said that voters have been alienated
  by their political parties in terms of voter education and candidates should interact
  more frequently with voters rather than only during election time.  Youth activist
  Azar Niaz from SCF exclaimed that a larger number of young voters will vote for
  the first time this election and so the youth have the power to turn the results
  of the elections and hence should not refrain from casting their votes.  Speakers
  also commented that appropriate arrangements should be made for female voters during
  the voting process.       1Share '

text: ' The shape and shading of your eyebrows can change the way you look quiet surprisingly.
  Here are the five most common blunders you make and how to correct them. Using one
  color to fill in the whole brow To make an additional natural-looking full brow,
  try using two shades to fill them in. Because the front half of the brow is generally
  pretty full, the tail (from the arch to the end) should always be filled in with
  a darker shade so it matches the front. Start from the arch to the end of the brow
  with the darker shade, and then fill in the front half with a slightly lighter hue.
  This makes the brow look even all the way across in a very natural way. Filling
  in brows from the inside out As mentioned above, majority of women need extra definition
  on the second half of their brows but they tend to fill in the front of the brow
  first. When that happens, they usually end up over-shading and are left with a brow
  that makes them look like they re pissed. Instead of that start at the end of the
  brow with a heavier hand then ease up on the pressure as you get closer to the inside.
  This is also a good trick if you re using a pencil to shade and want to achieve
  the look of using two colors Tweezing bare brows As attractive as it is to pull
  out the tweezers when your skin is fresh out of the shower, don t do it! Always
  fill in your brows before taking a tweezer to them. When your brows are  naked,  every
  hair can start to look like a stray, and that s when you over-pluck.  Using the
  old pencil trick to find your starting point By now you ve probably tried (or at
  least heard of) placing a pencil on the outside of your nose to find the perfect
  spot to start your brows. But that trick has been around for years, and brow shape
  trends have evolved since then. Instead of placing the pencil on the outside of
  your nose, hold it on top of the highest point of your nostril for most this would
  be right where your nostril connects to your nose. Point it straight up in line
  with your eyebrows; this is where the hair should start. Threading Beauty fads come
  and go, and in the eyebrow department, that would be threading. While it s great
  for the upper lip, it pulls out too much hair too quickly for the precision that
  s needed on eyebrows. Instead, if you want someone to groom your brows for you,
  then have a reputable esthetician tweeze or wax your brows.        '

text: ' KARACHI: Most of the 30 infrastructure development projects for which Sindh
  has released Rs150 million to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) have already
  been undertaken by the provincial government, and none of these projects is mentioned
  in the KMC s annual development plan, Daily Times has learnt. The Finance Department
  of Sindh has released the amount, 25 percent of the estimated cost of these projects,
  to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation on the request of the acting Metropolitan
  Commissioner. Sources in the KMC Planning and Budget Finance Department say that
  the projects exist on papers only. Most of these have been completed already under
  the provincial government s development works in the city. Meanwhile, KMC s Planning
  and Finance departments have written to the Engineering Department seeking details
  of all these 30 development projects including their location, approval date, PC-I,
  as well as working and progress reports. Speaking to Daily Times, Shahab Amwer,
  the Engineering Department director general, and Nayyab Saeed, director accounts,
  say that none of the 30 projects is mentioned in the district ADP, adding that no
  one in the department ever requested funds for such projects.   The amount has been
  released on special ground [by the Sindh government] and specific comments can be
  given only after we have received details of the projects , they said.  When asked
  that the projects for which funds have been released were not mentioned in the district
  ADP and were in fact completed by the provincial government, Dr Asghar Abbas, the
  acting MC, said the amount had been sanctioned from head of  lump-sum provisions  of
  Rs 5 billion. He said the KMC was the sole executing authority to fulfill all legal
  formalities for taking into consideration development schemes, vowing that completion
  of these development projects would be ensured by the civic entity. Niaz Soomro,
  the special secretary mega projects at the provincial Local Government Department,
  says that it is the responsibility of the KMC to run development projects. Under
  the Sindh Local Government Act of 2013, the civic entity can undertake projects
  worth Rs200 million on its own. The projects include Abdullah Haroon Road, Empress
  Market road, Sarwar Shaheed Road, Regal Chowk area, Cantt Station Road, Civil Lines,
  MT Khan Road, Burns Road and roads near Sindh Secretariat, and in Sultanabad, Gizri,
  Clifton, Aram Bagh, and Garhi Ghata.  Published in Daily Times, February  22nd  2018.        '

  on Thursday denounced party rivals and vowed to contest the upcoming general elections
  with party s full strength and intensity. After submitting nomination papers to
  contest election from provincial assembly seat PS-11 of Larkana, he addressed the
  media.  PPP will hunt its opponents with arrow (election symbol),  he remarked while
  adding that his daughter Nida Khuhro has also filed her nomination papers. Khuhro
  claimed that PPP will contest elections against candidates of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf
  (PTI), Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) and Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA).  On
  the one side, there are remnants of dictators, Taliban s henchmen and supporters
  of Kalabagh Dam while PPP stands in support of poverty-stricken and downtrodden
  masses on the other side,  he said. He vowed that PPP would form federal government
  as well as provincial government in Sindh with people s strength and support. He
  expressed deep concerns over the acute shortage of water and power outages in Sindh,
  and the timing of  controversial  issue of Kalabagh Dam being raised that further
  damaged the sentiments of people of Sindh.  GDA had carried out rallies to support
  Kalabagh Dam in the past,  he said while adding that people of Sindh know their
  stance very well and would not cast their votes to GDA.  The people of Sindh did
  not allow Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif to build Kalabagh Dam in the past, and
  would still resist the move,  he added. He demanded Supreme Court of Pakistan to

  \ UK and World Organization Against Torture, have requested President Pervez Musharraf\
  \ to commute the death sentence awarded to juvenile offender Muhammad Ameen.In their\
  \ separate appeals to the president, the two bodies have stated that Muhammad Ameen\
  \ was below 17 at the time of occurrence in 1998.They stated that a Rawalpindi bench\
  \ of the Lahore High Court and the Supreme Court of Pakistan had confused his age\
  \ with that of an injured person in the occurrence and mentioned it as 30 years,\
  \ which was incorrect.The Law Society is a professional body representing over 104,000\
  \ solicitors in England and Wales. It is concerned about the independence of the\
  \ legal profession, the rule of law and human rights throughout the world.In the\
  \ appeal, it states: \u201CThe Law Society recognizes the right and responsibility\
  \ of all governmental authorities to bring to justice those responsible for criminal\
  \ offences. We take no position on the retention or the abolition of the death penalty\
  \ in the domestic law of any country, but we believe strongly that it may only be\
  \ used in accordance with the international human rights standard.\u201D\u201COur\
  \ concerns in this case are that Muhammad Ameen was only 17 years of age at the\
  \ time of the crime and also that he did not receive a fair trial,\u201D the society\
  \ added.Similarly, the World Organization Against Torture, a network of over 240\
  \ human rights bodies across the world, has given an urgent action call to all its\
  \ members requesting them to send appeals to the president of Pakistan and other\
  \ officials for commuting the capital punishment slapped on Muhammad Ameen by an\
  \ anti-terrorism court and upheld by the Supreme Court and the high court.The Geneva-based\
  \ organization stated that Pakistan had recently abolished the death penalty against\
  \ minors by introducing a new Juvenile Justice System Ordinance in July 2000. Also,\
  \ under the Qisas and Diyat law, a minor cannot be awarded the \_death penalty.\
  \ But in this case, the trial court erroneously entered the age of the young man\
  \ as 18 and he is now facing the capital punishment. At this critical time, only\
  \ President Gen Pervez Musharaf has the powers to commute his death sentence.It\
  \ also stated that from a legal perspective, the issue of Mohammad Ameen\u2019s\
  \ age should have been raised and corrected in the first instance. The responsibility\
  \ of an advocate was to assist the court, however it was also the duty of the court\
  \ or the presiding officer to gather and keep as much information as required in\
  \ a particular case for a fair decision and the dispensation of justice.Hence, the\
  \ court itself (the trial court as well as the appellate court) should have taken\
  \ notice of the age of the accused by using its powers."

  \ premier\u2019s murder.\u201CWe appeal to Justice Minister Mohammed Ghafri to bring\
  \ Abdel Halim Khaddam before justice for high treason and to take the necessary\
  \ measures,\u201D said speaker Mahmud al Abrash.The parliament passed the motion\
  \ unanimously calling for a trial during a regular session in which several lawmakers\
  \ accused Mr Khaddam of \u2018treason\u2019 and \u2018corruption\u2019 for his remarks,\

  \ domination of Lebanon, made his explosive claims in an interview with Dubai-based\

  \ meeting took place a few months before the Feb 14 assassination of Mr Hariri in\
  \ a Beirut bomb blast for which a UN probe has implicated Syrian intelligence.\u201C\
  We must await the results of the investigation, but no Syrian security service could\
  \ take such a decision unilaterally,\u201D Mr Khaddam said.Mr Abrash said he had\
  \ been bombarded with phone calls from Syrians demanding that Mr Khaddam be arrested\
  \ by Interpol.\u201C(Khaddam) is the despicable face of the old guard which closed\
  \ political forums in Syria and threw their members into jail,\u201D said the Islamist\
  \ representative in parliament, Mohammed Habash.The murder of Mr Hariri, a billionaire\
  \ businessman and five-time prime minister, plunged Lebanon into political turmoil\
  \ and heightened international pressure on Syria to end its 29-year military presence\
  \ in its smaller neighbour.\u201CThe battle of Damascus, the battle of the regime\

  \ pro-Damascus newspaper Ad Diyar branded Mr Khaddam \u2018Syria\u2019s Judas\u2019\
  .Mr Khaddam said he had advised Mr Hariri to leave Lebanon \u2018because his situation\
  \ regarding Syria had become complicated\u2019 in the wake of the threat.\u201C\
  But, of course, at no time did it occur to me that Syria could assassinate Hariri,\u201D\
  \ Mr Khaddam said.In March, Syria denied a report from a UN fact-finding mission\
  \ that Mr Assad had threatened Mr Hariri and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt if they\
  \ opposed the policies of Damascus.Mr Mehlis said in an interview with an Arab newspaper\
  \ in mid-December he was convinced that Syria was responsible for Mr Hariri\u2019\
  s murder.Mr Khaddam also pointed a finger of blame for tensions in Lebanon before\
  \ the Hariri murder at Rustom Ghazaleh, Syria\u2019s military intelligence chief\
  \ in Lebanon before its troop withdrawal.In an interview with CNN in October, President\
  \ Assad rejected any notion he had played a personal role in the Hariri assassination.Mr\
  \ Assad, whose country has repeatedly denied any involvement in the murder, said\
  \ he had only found out about Mr Hariri\u2019s assassination \u2018from the news\
  \ ... in my office\u2019 and that any Syrian found guilty should be punished.In\
  \ the Al Arabiya interview, Mr Khaddam, 73, also announced the reasons for his resignation\
  \ at a Baath party congress in June and his break with the government.He said he\
  \ was \u2018convinced that the process of development and reforms, be they political,\
  \ economic or administrative, will not succeed\u2019 and preferred to choose \u2018\
  the motherland\u2019 over \u2018the regime\u2019.\u201CI have many things to say,\
  \ serious things, when the time is right,\u201D he said, adding however that his\
  \ relationship with Mr Assad remained \u2018amicable\u2019.Mr Khaddam, who long\
  \ served President Bashar\u2019s father Hafez before his death in 2000, was also\

  \ to lift the European Super Cup on Friday thanks to an early Andriy Shevchenko\
  \ header in a match that started brightly but faded into a largely scrappy affair.Despite\
  \ a number of long-range half-chances from Porto and some quick breaks in the second\
  \ half by Milan, the one moment of true class at the Stade Louis II came after only\
  \ 10 minutes when Ukrainian striker Shevchenko scored with a powerful header which\
  \ gave Porto goalkeeper Vitor Baia no chance.Shevchenko, voted man of the match\
  \ afterwards, moved perfectly into place between two Porto defenders to convert\
  \ a cross from the right from Milan\u2019s Portuguese attacker Rui Costa.With Milan\
  \ dominating much of the opening half it seemed that more goals would soon come,\
  \ but, after another well-worked move, again involving Rui Costa and ending with\
  \ Filippo Inzaghi shooting into the side netting, the game began to get mired in\
  \ midfield.Porto\u2019s Deco and Derlei were well-marshalled by Milan\u2019s Gennaro\
  \ Gattuso, Clarence Seedorf and, when danger threatened, the peerless Paolo Maldini\
  \ in defence.The Portuguese champions failed to make any attacking impression until\
  \ late in the first half when a speculative shot from Maniche went over the Milan\
  \ bar.As the Portuguese league season has already started, Porto should have looked\
  \ sharper and brighter than Milan, who came into the match having lost six successive\
  \ pre-season warm-ups.Too many of Porto\u2019s forward moves broke down through\
  \ poor passing, however, and Benni McCarthy, their new South African signing from\
  \ Celta Vigo had an ineffective match in attack and was replaced by Edgaras Jankauskas\
  \ after an hour.The Lithuanian did not fare much better himself and missed the ball\
  \ when he had a great chance to equalise just five minutes after coming on in an\
  \ attempt to liven up the Porto attack.He went close again after 56 minutes with\
  \ a long-range effort that just went wide. Substitute Jose Boswinga then fluffed\
  \ a good opportunity late in the game when he shot straight at Milan goalkeeper\
  \ Dida from six metres.But for the most part Milan, who won the Champions League\
  \ last season scoring only four goals in five matches in the knockout stage of the\
  \ competition and only one in the semifinals and final, did what they do best.They\
  \ held Porto at bay in midfield \u2014 but could not capitalise on some quick breakaway\
  \ chances set up by Gattuso and Andrea Pirlo, who both had impressive games.In a\
  \ rare second-half attack that almost led to a goal, Milan had a chance to double\
  \ their lead after 74 minutes but Inzaghi was foiled when Baia came off his line\
  \ to block the shot. Earlier, an Inzaghi header bounced off the Porto bar.Rui Costa\
  \ forced Baia into making an excellent save late in the game after dancing through\
  \ the Porto defence, and Rivaldo added some pep to the Milan attack when he came\
  \ on for the closing stages.In the end, though, Milan just about deserved to lift\
  \ the Super Cup for the first time since 1995 while Porto rarely looked like winning\
  \ their fifth trophy of the calendar year.\u2014Reuters"

  \ the attention of nationalists who had made sacrifices for Pukhtun, yet they were\

text: "PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY (Russia), Aug 7: Seven exhausted Russian sailors returned\
  \ to dry land on Sunday after a dramatic operation by a British undersea robot freed\
  \ their mini-submarine three days after it became trapped on the Pacific Ocean floor.The\
  \ rescue, some 75 hours after the Priz AS-28 mini-sub became snagged at the seabed\
  \ 190 meters underwater during military exercises, was completed with just hours\
  \ of oxygen supplies left for the stranded crew.\u201CWe believed the whole time\
  \ that we would be saved,\u201D the AS-28\u2019s captain, Vyacheslav Milashevsky,\
  \ told ITAR-TASS news agency after reaching Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the regional\
  \ capital, by boat.The men, wearing naval uniforms, looked drained, but happy as\
  \ they stepped onto dry land. There was no disguising the joy in Russia that they\
  \ had not shared the fate of the 118 sailors on the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk\
  \ five years ago.\u201CI cried from happiness and danced,\u201D Milashevsky\u2019\
  s wife Yelena said on state-run television.  The sailors were pronounced in good\
  \ health and taken to hospital for further check-ups.The key to the submariners\u2019\
  \ rescue from the seabed roughly 70 kilometres from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, was\
  \ the arrival of a British navy team with a sophisticated Scorpio underwater robot.Using\
  \ powerful cutters, the Scorpio slashed through the cables of a coastal defence\
  \ antenna and a fishing net in which the AS-28 had become trapped. In six hours,\
  \ the submarine was able to surface.Its crew, who had spent the last days mostly\
  \ in darkness and wearing thermal suits against the cold, opened the hatch themselves\
  \ and emerged into the air and light.Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov, who arrived\
  \ just as the British team was going to work, was shown on national television cheering\
  \ from a ship at the scene. The sudden success of British rescue experts was in\
  \ marked contrast to two days of futile efforts by Russian ships to haul up both\
  \ the mini-sub and the cables in which it was entangled.\u201CThe rescue operation\
  \ has had a happy ending. I thank everyone, including of course the British rescuers,\u201D\
  \ Pacific fleet commander Admiral Viktor Fyodorov said.British naval Commander Jonty\
  \ Powis said the mission was a close shave, since the stranded submariners had just\
  \ 10 to 12 hours before oxygen supplies ran out.\u201CWe were conscious that the\
  \ crew were running out of oxygen and that we could not afford any great delays\
  \ in cutting them free,\u201D Commander Powis said. \u201CThis was a fairly routine\
  \ procedure, but the fact that we were dealing with people\u2019s lives created\
  \ extra difficulties.\u201DPresident Vladimir Putin, who was widely criticized five\
  \ years ago for failing to take command over the Kursk disaster, ordered an official\
  \ inquiry on Sunday and issued a statement expressing thanks to all the rescuers.\
  \ However, he had yet to make any direct public reaction.Confusion in official statements\
  \ over the cause of the accident and widely-varying accounts of how much air the\
  \ crew had left also echoed the chaotic official response to the sinking of the\
  \ Kursk.However, Moscow\u2019s prompt appeal for international help could not have\
  \ been more different. \u2014AFP"

  Rs1,445    The Rohingya are a Muslim group who live in Rakhine state (formerly Arakan\
  \ state) in western Myanmar (Burma), a majority Buddhist country. According to the\
  \ United Nations, they are one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. They\
  \ suffer routine discrimination at the hands of neighboring Buddhist Rakhine groups,\
  \ but international human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch (HRW) have also\
  \ accused Myanmar s authorities of being complicit in a campaign of ethnic cleansing\
  \ against the Rohingya Muslims. The Rohingya face regular violence, arbitrary arrest\
  \ and detention, extortion, and other abuses, a situation that has been particularly\
  \ acute since 2012 in the wake of a serious wave of sectarian violence. Islam is\
  \ practiced by around 4% of the population of Myanmar, and most Muslims also identify\
  \ as Rohingya. Yet the authorities refuse to recognize this group as one of the\
  \ 135 ethnic groups or  national races  making up Myanmar s population. On this\
  \ basis, Rohingya individuals are denied citizenship rights in the country of their\
  \ birth, and face severe limitations on many aspects of an ordinary life, such as\
  \ marriage or movement around the country. This expose of the attempt to erase the\
  \ Rohingyas from the face of Myanmar is sure to gain widespread attention. Dr Azeem\
  \ Ibrahim obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge and served as a Research\
  \ Fellow at the International Security Program at the Kennedy School of Government\
  \ at Harvard, a World Fellow at Yale, Fellow and Member of the Board of Directors\
  \ at the Institute for Social Policy Understanding and an Adjunct Research Professor\
  \ at the Strategic Studies Institute US Army War College. He founded and actively\
  \ chairs a private grant-giving foundation (www.ibrahimfoundation.com) focusing\
  \ on innovative community projects. He served as a reservist in the UK s 4th Battalion\
  \ Parachute Regiment. When not running his business interests across the world,\
  \ he teaches at the Harris Public Policy School, University of Chicago.  Points\
  \ of Entry: Encounters at the Origin Sites of Pakistan\nNadeem Farooq Paracha\n\
  Tranquebar (2018)\nRs995    Pakistan is more than the sum of its news-making parts.\
  \ In these marvellous essays on history, politics and society, cultural critic Nadeem\
  \ Farooq Paracha upturns various reductive readings of the country by revealing\
  \ its multi-layered reality. With wit and insight, he investigates past events and\
  \ their implications for modern-day society. Thus, one piece explores how and why\
  \ Mohenjo-daro has been neglected as a historical site, and another examines how\
  \ Muhammad-bin-Qasim, who briefly invaded Sindh in 713 CE, has come to be lionised\
  \ as the original founder of Pakistan. There is a story about a Pakistani Jimi Hendrix\
  \ who plays the guitar like a dream and also one about a medieval emperor who lives\
  \ on in the swear words of a Punjabi peasant. There are essays on Pakistani pop\
  \ music, on Afro-Pakistanis and on how Jhuley Lal came to be more than just a folk\
  \ deity for Sindhi immigrants in India.\nPoints of Entry examines the constant struggle\
  \ between two distinct tendencies in Pakistani civic-nationalism one modernist,\
  \ the other theocratic and the complex society it has birthed.  Nadeem Farooq Paracha\
  \ is a well-known cultural critic, historian and columnist. He is associated with\
  \ Pakistan s largest English language daily, Dawn and also the author of two best-selling\
  \ books on the social history of Pakistan: End of the Past and The Pakistan Anti-Hero.\
  \  The House of Islam: A Global History\nEd Husain\nBloomsbury Publishing (2018)\n\
  Rs995    A fascinating and revelatory exploration of the intricacies of Islam and\
  \ the inner psyche of the Muslim world from the bestselling author of The Islamist\
  \  Islam began as a stranger,  said the Prophet Mohammed,  and one day, it will\
  \ again return to being a stranger. \nThe gulf between Islam and the West is widening.\
  \ A faith rich with strong values and traditions, observed by nearly two billion\
  \ people across the world, is seen by the West as something to be feared rather\
  \ than understood. Sensational headlines and hard-line policies spark enmity, while\
  \ ignoring the feelings, narratives and perceptions that preoccupy Muslims today.\
  \  Wise and authoritative, The House of Islam seeks to provide entry to the minds\
  \ and hearts of Muslims the world over. It introduces us to the fairness, kindness\
  \ and mercy of Mohammed; the aims of sharia law, through commentary on scripture,\
  \ to provide an ethical basis to life; the beauty of Islamic art and the permeation\
  \ of the divine in public spaces; and the tension between mysticism and literalism\
  \ that still threatens the House of Islam.\nThe decline of the Muslim world and\
  \ the current crises of leadership mean that a glorious past, full of intellectual\
  \ nobility and purpose, is now exploited by extremists and channelled into acts\
  \ of terror. How can Muslims confront the issues that are destroying Islam from\
  \ within, and what can the West do to help work towards that end?  Ed Husain expertly\
  \ and compassionately guides us through the nuances of Islam and its people, contending\
  \ that the Muslim world need not be a stranger to the West, nor its enemy, but a\
  \ peaceable ally. Ed Husain was an Islamist radical in his teens and early twenties.\
  \ After rejecting extremism, he travelled widely in the Middle East and worked for\
  \ the British Council in Syria and Saudi Arabia. He is an adjunct senior fellow\
  \ for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York; cofounder\
  \ of Britain s first Muslim counterextremism think tank, the Quilliam Foundation;\
  \ and a former senior adviser at the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. He lives in London\
  \ with his wife and daughter.  Reimagining Pakistan: Transforming a Dysfunctional\
  \ Nuclear State\nHusain Haqqani\nHarperCollins Publishers (2018)\nRs1,395    Salman\
  \ Rushdie once described Pakistan as a  poorly imagined country . Indeed, Pakistan\
  \ has meant different things to different people since its birth seventy years ago.\
  \ Armed with nuclear weapons and dominated by the military and militants, it is\
  \ variously described around the world as  dangerous ,  unstable ,  a terrorist\
  \ incubator  and  the land of the intolerant . Much of Pakistan s dysfunction is\
  \ attributable to an ideology tied to religion and to hostility with the country\
  \ out of which it was carved out   India. But 95 per cent of Pakistan s 210 million\
  \ people were born after Partition, as Pakistanis, and cannot easily give up on\
  \ their home. In his new book, Husain Haqqani, one of the most important commentators\
  \ on Pakistan in the world today, calls for a bold re-conceptualization of the country.\
  \ Reimagining Pakistan offers a candid discussion of Pakistan s origins and its\
  \ current failings, with suggestions for reconsidering its ideology, and identifies\
  \ a national purpose greater than the rivalry with India. Husain Haqqani is Pakistan\
  \ s leading dissident public intellectual. In addition to serving as Pakistan s\
  \ ambassador to the United States from 2008-2011, he was an adviser to three civilian\
  \ prime ministers, including Nawaz Sharif and the late Benazir Bhutto. Haqqani currently\
  \ lives in exile in the United States, where he is Senior Fellow and Director for\
  \ South and Central Asia at the Hudson Institute. He is co-editor of the journal\
  \ Current Trends in Islamist Ideology. His books include Pakistan Between Mosque\
  \ and Military; Magnificent Delusions: US, Pakistan and an Epic History of Misunderstanding;\
  \ and India v Pakistan: Why can t we just be friends?  India and Pakistan: Neighbours\
  \ at Odds\nAvtar Bhasin\nBloomsbury Publishing (2018)\nRs1,195    The book is based\
  \ on archival material accessed for the first time from the Nehru Papers and the\
  \ archives of the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. It provides\
  \ readers with a new perspective on a great many significant issues of the sub-continent\
  \ s India Pakistan discourse. The Partition was an opportunity for the two nations\
  \ to go their own ways and build egalitarian societies, complementing each other.\
  \ Unfortunately, unable to transcend old animosities, Pakistan added new ones to\
  \ construct the bogey of Indian hegemony. This was diametrically opposed to India\
  \ s determination to steer clear of the past and pursue a positive policy towards\
  \ Pakistan, since it shared centuries of historical, economic, social and cultural\
  \ ties with its people. For India, the separation was like a family dividing its\
  \ assets by mutual agreement of its members and living peacefully thereafter. For\
  \ Pakistan, however, the separation was akin to a permanent breakup of a family,\
  \ which was accompanied by the nursing of grievances and the harbouring of adversarial\
  \ feelings. It is this mental make-up dictating the Indo Pakistan narrative in the\
  \ years following the Partition, which the book succinctly captures. Avtar Singh\
  \ Bhasin, born in 1935, holds a Masters in history and enjoyed a short stint with\
  \ the National Archives of India and the Ministry of Defence, Government of India,\
  \ before joining the Ministry of External Affairs in 1963. Here he served for the\
  \ next three decades, retiring as Director (Historical Division) in 1993. During\
  \ his tenure in the Ministry, he served in Indian missions abroad and travelled\
  \ abroad extensively in the performance of his official duties. He took to academic\
  \ research after retirement. Avtar was Senior Fellow at the Indian Council of Historical\
  \ Research from 1994 to 1996, and Honorary Fellow at the Institute of Contemporary\
  \ Studies at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library from 1996 to 2000. As part of\
  \ his research, he produced five volumes each of documentary studies on India s\
  \ relations with Sri Lanka in 2001, Bangladesh in 2003, and Nepal in 2005. Avtar\
  \ also produced a ten-volume study on India Pakistan Relations in 2012. Another\
  \ study in the same genre, India   ASEAN; Peace and Prosperity, was published for\
  \ the Ministry of External Affairs for the Summit Conference of the ASEAN Heads\
  \ of Government held in New Delhi. His latest study, also in five volumes, India\
  \ China Relations   1947-2000, was published in January 2018. He edited and published\
  \ an annual series, India s Foreign Relations, from 2002 to 2013 for the Ministry\
  \ of External Affairs. He has also authored two other books, Some Called It Partition,\
  \ Some Freedom, and, India in Sri Lanka: Between Lion and the Tigers. The second\
  \ book was separately published in both India and Sri Lanka. "

text: ' On April 16, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) released its annual
  report. The report titled, State of Human Rights in 2017, was dedicated to the memory
  of human rights activist Asma Jahangir and it underscored the dire state of fundamental
  rights in Pakistan. Despite being elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council,
  which the report deems a diplomatic success, Pakistan has struggled to curtail religious
  extremism, breaches in freedom of movement, expression and association. Access to
  justice was also listed as an urgent issue. The report pointed out the state of
  health and education in the country, stating that Pakistan was among the countries
  with the highest number out-of-school children. It also mentioned the poor spending
  on public health by the government. A striking feature of the report was that the
  number of people killed in encounters (495) were more than those who were killed
  in terror attacks. Enforced disappearances also continue unabated, with 868 new
  cases in 2017.  The encounter culture is extremely old in our country,  said HRCP
  spokesperson Dr Mehdi Hasan, while talking to The Friday Times.  When police and
  other law enforcement authorities feel that a case cannot be proven in court, they
  take the law in their own hands.  The HRCP report also expressed alarm over the
  state of public education in Pakistan HRCP spokesperson IA Rehman said the encounters
  and disappearance numbers had increased across the country.  If you notice the figures,
  they show that the encounter culture varies across the provinces. Yet collectively,
  there s a significant increase in the overall numbers,  he said.  Also, let us not
  forget that there are extrajudicial killings that are not even considered as such   it
  s all about the culture.  The persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan was
  also noted in detail. The report noted that minority groups continued to be victimised.
  The report cited attacks on Shias, Christians and Ahmadis in particular and also
  discussed false accusations of blasphemy, which is an offence punishable by death
  in Pakistan.  A major factor behind all human rights violations is religious extremism,  said
  Dr Mehdi Hasan.  The religious right s attitude towards the minorities causes a
  lot of these violations. As soon as religion is involved, the government s attitude
  becomes apologetic and they do not take any action.  The report also gave a damning
  verdict on the rights of women in Pakistan, which continued to be ranked second
  worst on the Global Gender Gap Index.  It is criminal that we re sandwiched between
  Yemen and Syria. We should hang our heads in shame!  said HRCP vice chairperson
  Salima Hashmi. Hashmi noted that while certain positive measures were taken at the
  provincial level, the overall state of women rights remained abysmal. She cites
  the lack of legislation as the main reason behind this. The killing of Naqeebullah
  Mehsood in a police encounter sparked protests across the country  The struggle
  to raise the minimum age for marriage of girls, with the opposition coming from
  the Council of Islamic Ideology and religious parties, is evidence enough for the
  task ahead of us in terms of getting closer to gender parity,  Hashmi said. Hashmi
  added that another cause for concern was the disparity between the government s
  figures of crimes against women and the data that the HRCP had collected, which
  showed great abuse.  Moreover, this is an election year and there are still 12 million
  unregistered female voters in the country. This is one of our biggest concerns,  she
  added. Dr Mehdi Hassan believed that state institutions were responsible for all
  human rights violations.  If the institutions did their job responsibly, the human
  rights situation could be a lot better,  he says. Not long after this review of
  attacks on human rights in the country was published, the house of its editor was
  broken into, which is being seen as a  burglary-style raid.  The perpetrators took
  away laptops and hard drives belonging to Maryam Hasan, the editor of the report,
  as well as jewellery and some valuables. Although Maryam did not wish to speak the
  media till the incident has been investigated by the police, IA Rehman said the
  culprits had made it appear as a burglary to intimidate the editor.  They were not
  thieves. What would thieves want with our reports, laptops and hard drives? Had
  they been thieves they would have robbed the house when Maryam wasn t home. They
  actually went back and returned the next day because their goal was to scare her,  he
  said. Rehman said the police were not cooperating in the case.  The police, after
  arriving at the scene of the crime, refused to write the First Information Report
  (FIR). When we asked to get the FIR registered at the police station, they refused
  again, saying that they didn t want to write the report like that, that it should
  be different.   When a person goes to get an FIR registered, they tell police what
  happened and they are supposed to write it down. That is how it is done. In that
  moment there is no need for any other advocacy, the legal course is that you write
  down what is told. They also made excuses like  our system is down  and claimed
  that  we would send a lawyer when the system is back up . As things stand, there
  is no FIR of the incident registered.  Rehman maintains that HRCP is a  very small  organisation  without
  any enemies.   We don t bother anyone. We don t have an enmity with anyone. And
  yet there was an attack on us   you know very well what this means.  '

text: '  E-peace  Sir, India is in the midst of a revolution, which is touching the
  lives of more and more citizens everyday. This revolution comes to us courtesy the
  wave of Internet shopping that is growing at an accelerated pace. What makes it
  a revolution is the reach of e-stores, which do not have to face geographical constraints.
  Even denizens from remote villages are ordering their choicest brands and fancy
  products from the Internet storefront. While rich collegians from metro cities are
  flaunting stylish accessories shopped on the go from US and European portals, there
  are people like Laxman Ravat, who hails from a lesser-known hamlet called Salambar
  in western India. Laxman, who works as a domestic help, has a small feeling of joy
  somewhere inside. The joy is anticipation of a pack of seven saris (Indian traditional
  wear for women) that he ordered online with a friend s help for the women of his
  entire extended family at a 70% discount, cash-on-delivery. If there is a possible
  way to brighten the affinity between India and Pakistan, it may be through affirmative
  acquaintance between the youths of both countries. Actually, there are a lot of
  commonalities between these Internet generations, like their sociability for gadgets,
  like for technology and inclination to being more stylish and fashionable. There
  may be hundreds of thousands of merchandise in both countries that are beyond the
  reach of those across the border, but may sell like hot cakes if offered to the
  audience on the other side. This may include clothes, jewelry, artifacts and food
  products, among several others. What if e-retailers from both countries start promoting
  their online portals across the dividing line? First of all, there will be the opportunity
  of a huge brand new market for retailers, many of whom are currently busy exercising
  every bit of effort to find and bring in new habitu  to their e-outlets. Consumers
  can now shop a whole new set of products that were never before available. But,
  most of all, there is a good probability that it will build an entire new relationship
  of trust and dependency between traders and clients located in two different lands.
  If governments and trade organisations offer an environment and infrastructure for
  necessary checks, the concept that looks like a dream may become a reality. Also,
  the borders that would be crossed by deliveries of choicest goods everyday would
  have fewer chances of going to war. Nischal Sanghavi, Gujarat.  Kashmir Sir, Here
  is a piece of history by Dr Nyla Ali Khan, a Kashmiri scholar at the Oklahoma University,
  that raises pertinent questions about the willingness of both Pakistan and India
  to resolve the Kashmir dispute, amicably, bilaterally under the UN Resolutions.
  The policymakers need to evaluate the available options and understand the situation
  keeping in view the Kashmiri people s aspirations, fears and reservations. In the
  interests of expediency, the UNCIP appointed a single mediator, Sir Owen Dixon,
  the United Nations representative for India and Pakistan, Australian jurist and
  wartime ambassador to the United States, to efficiently resolve the Kashmir conflict.
  Dixon noted, in 1950, that the Kashmir issue was so tumultuous because Kashmir was
  not a holistic geographic, economic, or demographic entity, but, on the contrary,
  an aggregate of diverse territories brought under the rule of one maharaja. In a
  further attempt to resolve the conflict, Sir Owen Dixon propounded the trifurcation
  of the state along communal or regional lines, or facilitating the secession of
  parts of the Jhelum Valley to Pakistan. Despite the bombastic statements of the
  governments of both India and Pakistan, however, the Indian government has all along
  perceived the inclusion of Pakistani-administered J&K and the Northern Areas into
  India as unfeasible. Likewise, the government of Pakistan has all along either implicitly
  or explicitly acknowledged the impracticality of including the predominantly Buddhist
  Ladakh and predominantly Hindu Jammu as part of Pakistan. The coveted area that
  continues to generate irreconcilable differences between the two governments is
  the Valley of Kashmir. There seemed to be an inexplicable reluctance on both sides,
  India and Pakistan, to solve the Kashmir dispute diplomatically and amicably. Sir
  Dixon s concluding recommendation was a bilateral resolution of the dispute with
  India and Pakistan as the responsible parties, without taking into account the ability
  of the representatives of the people of J&K to be the architects of their political
  future. Is this the anachronistic policy being toed by the governments of India
  and Pakistan in 2015? What Pakistan needs to do is to exploit effectively and forcefully
  the rebutting of the Indian claim of Occupied Kashmir being part of India, by the
  Jammu and Kashmir High Court that has recently ruled that the State has never been
  part of India.  Article 370 of Indian constitution that deals with the status of
  Jammu and Kashmir is beyond abrogation, repeal or even amendment,  the high court
  said in its ruling the other day.  Article 35A gives  protection  to existing laws
  in force in the State. Article 370 though titled as  Temporary Provision  and included
  in Para XXI titled  Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions  has assumed
  place of permanence in the Constitution,  a division bench of justice Hasnain Masoodi
  and Janak Raj Kotwal ruled in a 60-page judgement.  It is beyond amendment, repeal
  or abrogation, in as much as Constituent Assembly of the State before its dissolution
  did not recommend its Amendment or repeal,  the bench ruled. The decision has been
  highly welcomed by the local parties and political figures representing the major
  population, Muslims. Peoples Democratic Front (PDF) President and Awami Muthida
  Mahaz (AMM) leader Hakim Mohammad Yasin welcomed the landmark judgment. They said,  Now
  the challenge for Jammu and Kashmir government is to further strengthen Article
  370. According to the ruling, the Article 370 is a permanent provision of the Constitution
  and it cannot be abrogated, repealed or even amended.  It is a welcome decision.
  There was a demand within and outside the Assembly that Article 370 should be safeguarded
  and the High Court s historic decision is a welcome step. But now it a challenge
  for the J&K government and especially for Mufti sahib how to further strengthen
  it (Article 370) and restore those previsions of this Article which have been eroded
  over the years,  Hakim Yasin said in a press statement.  Limited sovereignty or
  special status stands guaranteed under Article 370 of the Constitution,  he added.
  Media, both print and electronic, must highlight it and the foreign office as well
  as the intelligentsia must debate it in order to find out and put pressure on India
  as well as the world community to take the initiative towards resolution of Kashmir
  as early as possible. One remembers the words of Chief of Army Staff General Raheel
  Sharif, who, on the eve of Golden Jubilee of 6 September war of 1965, said in his
  speech:  Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of the subcontinent s partition. The people
  of Indian occupied Kashmir are being subjected to Indian injustice and atrocities
  for over the last seven decades. Enduring peace in the region is not possible without
  just resolution of Kashmir, it can be no longer put on the back burner. Therefore,
  time has come that Kashmir issue should be resolved in line with the aspirations
  of its people in accordance with UN resolutions.  Fauzia Sardar Niazi, Islamabad.  State
  obligation Sir, It is the insatiable greed of a few members of the political, civil
  and uniformed elite of Pakistan and their conflicts of interest that have driven
  the country to its present state of impending financial bankruptcy and lawlessness.
  Most problems we face today are products of abuses of power and greed of corrupt
  officials, who went from rags to riches, building business empires at the cost of
  compromising our national security and state sovereignty. General Raheel started
  the process of reforming the army through accountability and it is hoped that General
  Bajwa takes it to its logical conclusion. This country s obligation should be to
  work for the welfare of young officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army like Captain
  Asfandyar Bokhari, Captain Tasleem Haider, Captain Sana and scores of other civilians,
  who offered the supreme sacrifice defending this country and not all those who performed
  duties for which they were paid.  Instead of gifting luxurious houses and tax amnesties
  to those who are already affluent, we owe these benefits only to the families of
  those who embraced martyrdom, or were permanently disabled while on active duty.
  We live in a global village where the system of governance and welfare obligations
  of state are defined and laid by ethics set by our religion and universally adopted
  by all developed and civilized countries where there is rule of law. Unfortunately,
  it was conflict of interest of the khaki elite during the tenure of Musharraf who
  introduced the  points formula , awarding plots on every promotion and posting,
  and introducing an element of greed for real estate. Scams involving few corrupt
  officers who with a nexus of land mafia deprived citizens of their lifelong savings,
  and did not spare even beneficiaries of Army Welfare Fund. A M Tariq, Malaysia.
  Oh, You, Up There Sir, You have it all? You have the resources to make it happen
  You have it all   You have clothes, you have wealth, you have plenty of food You
  have it all You have lands, you have houses, you have cars You have it all   You
  have diamonds, you have rubies, you have emeralds You think you have it all   You
  have shoes, you have bags   Gucci, Prada, Dior You think you have it all   but you
  desire more of it all   You say you are up there   above them all Born to a certain
  family of privilege and wealth   everybody else  nobodies !   But look around you   open
  your eyes See  your   brothers and sisters  and their children   bare, hungry   without
  it all Do you care, do you see, do you even feel? Instead of the  extra  designer
  clothes or bags buy them basic food or clothes   Oh men and women of wealth, have
  a heart, have a conscience, Use the wealth that Rabbee gave you in a better way   The
  wealth you have does not make you special, what you do with it does Collect that
  wealth to build a school, fund a hospital, fund a charity   You may have 30 pairs
  of clothes and plenty of shoes in your cupboard but at the end of the day you only
  wear one pair a day   think!   Remember the simplicity of Umar, the Prophet/s (pbuh/t)
  and the saints At one Friday prayer Umar, the Imam, was late as he awaited his one
  pair to dry   If you utilize the resources God gave you and see it as a responsibility
  With plenty of return and as an investment in the hereafter, as God promises   You
  can re-focus your intentions and actions in relation to your wealth If you spend
  to improve this world not just stock up for your lifeless cupboard   If you reach
  out to humanity sowing seeds of love and peace as sadqa-e-jarya Then, only then,
  you can happily turn around and truly say,    I have it all ! Amineh Hoti, Lahore.  Fate
  of PPP Sir, Reference media reports about the choice of venue and glamour, pomp
  and show for holding the 50 Years ceremony of launching of the PPP by its founder
  Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and his colleagues, all educated men of character, with integrity
  and devotion. I was among many other friends of my age group who attended the launching
  of the PPP on a vacant plot behind the residence of Dr Mubashar Hassan, opposite
  Auriga cinema, and have painfully seen it decline from being a party whose leader
  ZAB had captured the hearts and minds of young men and women, giving hope to poor
  farmers and laborers to its present abysmal decline. The choice of venue for its
  inauguration in 1966 compared to the fort like venue says it all. ZAB was politically
  ambitious and had many weaknesses but even his worse critics cannot accuse him of
  institutionalized corruption, involvement with land and sugar mafia, kickbacks,
  pilfering state coffers, or compromising state sovereignty and national interest
  for petty commercial benefits. He chose to live in hearts and minds of people instead
  of building and buying castles. Just compare the caliber and choice of ZAB s cabinet
  members and the controversies and scams of those appointed by Asif Zardari. It was
  ZAB s choice of a man of integrity and commitment like Rafique Saigol and Nur Khan
  that PIA was resurrected from ruins, and compare it to the choice of cronies with
  a history of financial impropriety who were appointed by Zardari and under whom
  the national airline deteriorated to a state of perpetual bankruptcy. ZAB wanted
  a place in history and was the pioneer of our nuclear defense strategy, which today
  offers an effective deterrence against enemy attacks. The PPP survives solely on
  the legacy of ZAB and his daughter. But this cannot go on endlessly, its edifice
  is crumbling, unless political leadership decides to follow the legacy of its founder.
  Bilawal, an educated young man, has to make a choice of following the legacy of
  either ZAB or Zardari, both of whom had nothing in common insofar as values, politics,
  ideology and goals are concerned. Malik Ali, Lahore.  Pak-Afghan peace Sir, There
  have been many ups and downs in the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
  Immediately after taking over the reins of Afghanistan, Mohammad Ashraf Ghani made
  moves that signalled a future of peace and cooperation between the two countries,
  giving birth to the hope, on both sides, that the rapidly deteriorating relations
  between the two volatile neighbours are about to move in the right direction. Unfortunately,
  however, this hope dissipated sooner than expected. The government of President
  Ashraf Ghani lost no opportunity in blaming Pakistan for conducting terror attacks
  in Afghanistan. Naturally, Pakistan tersely rejected the allegations of the Afghan
  government. Unquestionably, a politically stable and economically strong Afghanistan
  is in the interest of not only Pakistan, but the entire region. Why would then Pakistan
  at all support any subversive activity, by any quarter, in Afghanistan that would
  destabilise the country? It is vital to the interest of both Afghanistan and Pakistan
  that they bury the hatchet, once and for all, and make genuine endeavours to establish
  mutual trust and respect among each other. This is one extremely significant element
  that seems to be conspicuously missing in the existing frosty relationship between
  the two countries. Fazal Elahi, Islamabad. '

text: ' Coffee Shop is one of the episodes of the series New York Stories aired on
  HUM TV. Comprising thirteen episodes, each telling a different story, the series
  is based on the lives of South Asian expatriates residing in New York. Written by
  Larry Pontius, directed by Mehreen Jabbar and co-directed by Deepti Gupta, Coffee
  Shop is a light-hearted comic episode that revolves around three friends, Fatima,
  Saba and Nandini. However, the focus remains more on the latter two throughout,
  played by Diksha Basu and Farah Bala. While Saba is an organised and hard-working
  girl with more focus on her job and less on her looks and her man-to-be, Nandini
  is stylish, flirtatious and someone who performs tasks with alacrity instead of
  by managing them. Attached to their office is a coffee shop which they visit to
  buy coffee which they can enjoy sipping during work. It happens that both the friends
  fall for the man serving at the shop, named Rizwan. This character performed by
  Rupak Ginn is made an attraction for Saba and Nandini owing to his charming smile,
  seeing which both the friends start devising ways to approach him. While Saba remains
  a little reserved and controlled in the pursuit, Nandini openly flirts with the
  man, but all in vain. Surprisingly, Rizwan shows indifference to Nandini s efforts
  and expresses his likeness for Saba. This results in the girls  friendship being
  threatened by an outsider, the engendered jealousy depicted through humorous situations
  such as Nandini taking all the credit for the assigned office tasks and Saba spilling
  a whole garbage bin over Nandini. However, Saba, without caring about her friend
  s envious attitude, goes out on a date with Rizwan on his request. What follows
  is full of surprises, ironies and comic situations   for which the episode is a
  must-watch.    The strong script keeps the viewer hooked till the last scene despite
  revolving around only three to four characters and using minimal locations Coffee
  Shop is a simple work with a strong script which keeps the viewer hooked till the
  last scene despite revolving around three to four characters only and using minimal
  locations   mostly an office cabin and a coffee shop. It is what one can call comedy
  in the real sense of the word, for it is  feel-good , has sarcasm in its dialogues
  and is rich with hilarious scenes. Saba s character is executed marvellously by
  Diksha Basu, for she does justice to the shy character by stammering at times and
  showing bafflement. On the other hand, watching Farah Bala in a comic piece is an
  experience entirely different from watching her in Larry Pontius s serious drama,
  Neeyat. She presents herself as a mature actor whose every dialogue is delivered
  with impressive enunciation. Rupak Ginn does have a charming smile and proves himself
  the perfect choice for the character. Other performers with guest appearances in
  the episode are Deepti Gupta herself, Reena Puri, Tommy Schoffler, Noshir Dalal,
  Andrew Prokopenko, Sara the cat and Mohammed Ahmed (whose voice has been used only).
  Coffee Shop does hide a few bitter realities underneath, such as falling for appearances
  and calling grapes sour, but the episode presents itself as pure entertainment in
  such a fine manner that one does not feel like critically analysing it. Its beauty
  lies in watching it as a comedy only, and a comedy of menace. The writer is a student
  of English Language and Literature at GCU, Lahore and can be reached at m.ali_aquarius85@yahoo.com '

- ' The Last Word'
text: ' The ferry from the caldera of Santorini to the island of Crete takes about
  two hours going due south, but the journey makes you feel like you ve traveled farther
  back in time. You can spend most of the ride on the outdoor decks, and if you look
  past the many couples recreating the Titanic pose (not the most auspicious nautical
  reference), you can see jutting rocks and violently blue waters that look no different
  than they would have millennia ago. I suppose most unspoiled nature is like that,
  but there is something about a virgin Greek landscape that looks like the beginning
  of a Homeric TV miniseries waiting to happen and that thrilled me no end. Ferries
  are the easiest and cheapest way to get around the Greek islands, since most don
  t have airports and it s really fun to travel by sea, like a mini-cruise. I had
  initially planned to go to Lesvos, famous first as the home of Sappho and later
  as the first point of entry for migrants to Greece. For various reasons this didn
  t pan out and so I set my sights on Greece s largest Island, Crete. No one thought
  the Palace of Knossos was a real place until it was discovered The island really
  is quite large and it takes seven hours to get from one side to the other. Crete
  was the birthplace and center of the Minoan civilisation, which ended about 1400
  BC, and you may know of them through the legend of the Minotaur who roamed the darkened
  labyrinth in the Palace of Knossos. At various stages after the Minoans, the territory
  was ruled by the Myceneans, the Romans, the Persians, the Venetians, the Ottomans,
  the Turks and the Greeks. Having just been to Venice, I was curious to see how these
  many influences   some of them echoed in our own culture back home   would have
  transferred here. We were dropped off in the city of Heraklion, home to the main
  port and named, you might have surmised, after Herakles. The modern part of Heraklion
  is a town like any other, with streetlights and roads and highways. I had decided
  stay nearer to Heraklion than to the port village of Chaniya, which was way on the
  other side of the Island, mainly because it was closer to the airport. For an island
  as big as Crete, it is wise to pick a portion of it to explore well rather than
  crisscross around in a bus all day, Chinese-tourist style, to take snapshots of
  everything. It is simply too big. Figurine of a Minoan snake deity The hotel was
  about half an hour away and on a beach. It turned out to be one of those all-inclusive
  resorts (my only experience of such places was from the movie Dirty Dancing), but
  it turns out not only the food but the drinks are included too! I had underestimated
  how much families love all-inclusive places, and was disturbed to find clowns dancing
  around the pools to keep the many, many kids occupied while mummy and daddy got
  sloshed at the pool bar. Luckily there was more than one pool and in any case, I
  spent my time planning excursions. My first one was to the old city of Herakion,
  which is the capital of Crete and houses its oldest buildings. In what is a common
  theme in Greek island life, earthquakes keep destroying the buildings, so that everything
  is built of fragments of everything else. (Even the Palace of Knossos was rebuilt
  three times because it kept getting knocked over.) While sipping grappa in the shade
  of one of its many cafes you make out different Venetian arches, Roman basins and
  Ottoman minarets that dot the older city squares.  I saw the main archeological
  museum, which has some of the most exquisite Minoan art in the world, as well as
  really large architectural models of what the Palace of Knossos looked like at its
  epoch. The Palace, or the foundations of it that remain, is absolutely incredible.
  The legend comes from Homer s Iliad, from where we also get the tales of the city
  of Atlantis and Helen of Troy. Homer tells us that King Milos kept his son   who
  was half bull, half man   locked up in a massive and inescapable labyrinth deep
  below his sumptuous palace. The hero Thesius arrived and was due to fight the minotaur.
  The king s daughter was in love with the hero and gave him a ball of string so he
  wouldn t get lost in the maze and perish like the many before him. Theseus slew
  the Minotaur, escaped the maze and ran off with the princess. (I also recommend
  you read the Iliad, since the preceding summary of it reads like a TV Guide synopsis
  of  War and Peace. ) The Palace of Knossos, birthplace of the Minotaur legend and
  so much more  It s important to remember that (like the city of Troy) no one thought
  that this was a real place until it was discovered. For years it languished under
  a mound of dirt, forgotten to space and time until it was excavated in the early
  20th century when a farmer s plough accidentally dug up some amphorae, which had
  painted on them the symbol of the labyrinth, and excited quite a few people. The
  ruins have been excavated quite thoroughly now, and bits of them have been reconstructed
  to show the visitors what the palace might have looked like as glorious buildings.
  The Minoans had fantastic murals and frescoes, some of which were found perfectly
  preserved, and the archeologists have reproduced them whenever possible (the originals
  are in the museum, which is amazing when you think that that pigment is over 3000
  years old). The center of the massive complex is a throne room carved into stone
  in which they found two openings no larger than a brick on either wall and in the
  center, a large stone basin. The mathematics of the architecture of the palace are
  so exact that even now, on both equinoxes, a single beam of light passes through
  those openings and illuminates the water basin, a sight presumably as cool in 1400
  BC as it is now. The complex also boasts the oldest stone steps in Europe and is
  overgrown with olive groves and cypress trees and it exceeds every expectation I
  had of such a mythic, storied place. It used to be called the place of knowledge,
  where philosophers and thinkers went to learn, and it is thought that the very word  knowledge  was
  derived from this palace. I can go on about it for ages but I highly recommend you
  go, if only because there are so few times you can literally walk in the footsteps
  of legends. Write to thekantawala@gmail.com '

text: ' How do you see the security situation in Afghanistan? The security situation
  in Afghanistan is as bad as it has been at any point since the international forces
  took over in 2002. There is an uneasy calm in areas with weak militant presence
  and acts of violence are committed on a daily basis in the capital Kabul and in
  southern parts of the country where Taliban are strong. Taliban have retained the
  capacity to strike at will despite the presence of international forces for the
  past 12 years. The recent complex attack in a very secure area of Kabul is indicative
  of Taliban s resilience. The Taliban insurgency is more of a franchise rather than
  a large organization with a central command. The international forces are following
  a policy of population-centric counter insurgency (COIN) in which they are concentrating
  on large population centers leaving behind the majority of rural population at the
  mercy of militants. Consequently, this policy has largely been unsuccessful in creating
  any lasting security except in the security bubbles around NATO bases. 2014 is the
  make or break year for Afghanistan and national, regional and international players
  need to find a lasting solution. What is the future of Taliban in Afghanistan?  There
  are examples from around the globe where extremists have been pacified. Afghanistan
  is not one of them. Taliban are here to stay for a long time to come. Though Taliban
  don t necessarily follow the trans-national Jihadi ideology of Al Qaeda, nonetheless
  they want Sharia-based laws for their country. Taliban draw their financial and
  philosophical strength from Wahabi ideology. As long as Saudi-Iran rivalry plagues
  the south Asian region, Taliban will be funded and supported. There is no dearth
  of recruits for Taliban. There is a very high unemployment rate in Afghanistan and
  Taliban empower ordinary citizens with an AK-47 and enough money to support their
  families. The innumerable madrassas on the Pakistani side of the Durand Line are
  churning Taliban recruits at an unimaginable rate. The perpetual turmoil since 1973
  has produced at least two generations of illiterate Afghans who can be easily persuaded
  to join the so-called Jihad against the western infidels. The international community
  needs to leave the Afghans alone and help broker a regional solution so that proxy
  wars are not fought on the Afghan soil. As long as Afghanistan stays unstable and
  does not invest heavily in modern education, Taliban will remain relevant in the
  foreseeable future.  Has the new government in Islamabad changed its approach to
  insurgency in Afghanistan?  Pakistan s Afghan policy is largely controlled from
  Rawalpindi and not from Islamabad. So far we have seen a continuation of the old
  policy adopted in the early 1980s. The Pakistani establishment somehow believes
  that a friendly government in Kabul is their best chance to quell Pashtun nationalism.
  The systematic Talibanization of Pakistan has bogged down the establishment at home
  and is not allowing it to meddle in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and India
  and other regional countries. As a result, pursuing the goal of a soft government
  in Kabul is not a top priority as it has been in the past. However, the policy of
  picking and choosing terrorist groups is strongly pursued. Haqqanis are the current
  favorites and they remain state guests in Islamabad. The current policy is to wait
  and see who Karzai s successor is. Islamabad is holding its card close to the chest
  but would certainly like to remain relevant in any future Afghan set-up. Unlike
  his previous two terms, Nawaz Sharif appears frail and has lost touch with reality.
  A weak civilian government will pave the way for GHQ to call the shots and dictate
  their will on Kabul. Who will lead Afghanistan after Karzai? How do you see the
  upcoming Afghan presidential election? Although the Afghan elections are only two
  months away, there are real concerns about the viability of the electoral process.
  The security situation could worsen in a matter of days as the future of Bilateral
  Security Agreement (BSA) is uncertain. Karzai has toughened his stance on signing
  the BSA and NATO now believes that he won t sign it. If NATO decides to go for zero-option,
  it will play well for the terrorists. In the complete absence of international forces,
  Taliban can have a field day with those participating in the election process. We
  have seen extremely low turnouts in the past and another low turnout could mean
  less credible results.  The credibility of Afghan government has eroded over time
  and the political process is in danger of being taken over by chaos and violence.
  It appears that the top candidates are Ashraf Ghani backed largely by Pashtuns and
  Abdullah Abdullah supported by Tajiks and other northern communities. Ashraf Ghani
  s decision to pick Rashid Dostum as his number two is not playing well with Pashtuns.
  Can natural resources play an important role in the future of Afghanistan? Afghanistan
  is sitting on mineral resources worth 3 trillion US dollars. These include huge
  deposits of Rare Earth Elements (REEs) which are in great demand for high tech industries.
  China is the sole provider of REEs and would like to maintain its monopoly. It is
  already in the lead for bidding on some of the mineral resources, followed by India.
  If properly explored, exploited and managed, these could possibly transform Afghanistan
  into a wealthy nation. '

text: ' Women s world  Sir, The connections between globalization and women s education
  have never been more under the public gaze, but much of the debate on the issue
  has been superficial. It could be argued that all too often, the messages communicated
  are distorted via  western perceptions . Women educationalists have a responsibility
  therefore to ensure that the voices of the women and marginalized are heard. Globalization
  is having an increasingly direct impact upon people s lives. It is also becoming
  relatively easier to access information about global issues. Educationalists can
  no longer argue that  education  and  globalization  are separate. People are more
  aware of global issues now, but how do they decide as to how they will critically
  assess the information they receive? That is why women s education and development
  is so important. Women s education will help them understand their own self and
  situation in a wider context, make connections between local and global events,
  develop skills and knowledge to interpret events affecting their lives (for example
  sexual abuse and harassment), understand the cause of global inequality and justice,
  combat racism and xenophobia, widen their horizons, and make a difference in their
  worlds by participating in the society. It is often where women educationalists
  have engaged in broader debates that progress has been made. Through a range of
  international and national policies and programmes, the term  global  is becoming
  part of everyday language of educationalists. Women s education should also offer
  a range of perspectives and views. It needs to be perceived as making connections
  between local and the global values based on equity, social justice and women s
  rights. In order to achieve this, women development educationalist should see their
  role as people who can influence societies and empower women to develop the skills,
  knowledge and values that can make connections between their own lives and those
  of people elsewhere in the world. Only then will societies promote learning that
  creates a better understanding of women s inequality in the world and gives women
  the skills and value base to enable them to create their own voices and forms of
  engagement to secure their social lives. Rameesa Khan, Lahore. What ails Pakistan  Sir,
  The crowds that throng Imran Khan s rallies are disappointed with the PPP and the
  PML-N more than supportive of the PTI for the party s own merit. Despite the fact
  that Imran Khan is surrounded by men of controversy who have been part of tyrannical
  governments run by corrupt dictators, he manages to pull large crowds. The only
  option left for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is to be seen making changes in his
  team, appoint people on merit to head state institutions and corporations, and ensure
  that independent regulatory bodies are empowered to protect state funds and assets
  and people s rights. Take the food industry for example. Now that farmers have been
  allowed to charge prices prevailing in the international market, the prime minister
  must bring their income under direct taxation, while making sure that wages for
  farm labor are hiked proportionately. Unless every income is subjected to direct
  taxation, he cannot provide subsidy for basic food items, without which anger on
  the streets will not subside. Universally accepted norms and ethics such as Conflict
  of Interest codes must be strictly followed by members of his cabinet and all those
  holding public offices. The patience of masses, driven to desperation by massive
  corruption and inflation, has run out, and they seek change. International donor
  agencies and elected heads of state of major aid giving nations in Europe and the
  US have repeatedly emphasized that it is time Pakistan s affluent rich start paying
  taxes, instead of burdening western taxpayers. All international regulatory agencies
  have declared Pakistan at the top of the lists of countries with the worst socio-economic
  indicators, with Polio, Hepatitis, Breast Cancer and Infant Mortality assuming an
  epidemic situation. Malik Tariq, Lahore. Beware Bilawal  Sir, This is with reference
  to the reports of the Khairpur bus accident that killed 57 people. Mere expressions
  of sympathy and statements of the chief minister or the prime minister  taking note  are
  not enough; nor are the usual announcements for compensation. Those responsible
  for massive corruption in building highways, be it NHA or the provincial government,
  and those who are responsible for regulating the safety of the passengers, cannot
  be absolved. The PPP has ruled Sindh for more than seven years. It was under their
  rule that corrupt bureaucrats were calling the shots, and their handpicked men notorious
  for abuse of power and financial mismanagement destroyed an already decadent infrastructure.
  If highways in Sindh are the worst in the country in spite of billions of rupees
  allocated for their construction, development and maintenance, the onus rests on
  those who held power. Be it the Thar famine or the criminal gangs that reap a harvest
  in Karachi and interior Sindh, the buck stops with all those who have ruled this
  province, including their coalition partners holding key ministerial posts in health
  and ports & shipping. The development of infrastructure in Karachi and interior
  Sindh took place prior to 1958, and then under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Thereafter,
  all that has been witnessed is systematic plunder and exploitation of the province.
  Hundreds of thousands of people have perished in floods that have ravaged this province
  repeatedly, with not even an iota of improvement. If young Bilawal wants the PPP
  to perform, he needs to review the role of the aunts and uncles of his party, and
  weed out corruption. Otherwise this party will never regain its lost prestige and
  credibility. Aneela Chandio, Sukkur. Delhi s dreams  Sir, The Indian strategic community
  appears to be perturbed by the rise of China as an economic powerhouse of the world
  and unprecedented growth in China s offensive and defensive military might over
  the preceding decades. In order to position itself as a great power, India is also
  trying to emerge as a formidable pole of economic and military power. To realize
  the dream into a tangible reality, India is striving hard to enhance its hard and
  soft power by reaching to far corners of the world in order to secure and safeguard
  its geo-strategic, military and economic interests. This hot pursuit of great power
  status is replete with multifaceted pitfalls leading to direct diplomatic and economic
  confrontation with China. Since Chinese takeover of the Gwadar port, Indian government
  has been deliberating to manipulate by constructing the first foreign project at
  Chabhar in Iran. Located on the confluence of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman,
  the port is 76 km away from Gwadar with close proximity to the Strait of Hormuz,
  a conduit to 4% of the world s oil trade. In this regard, Narendra Modi s government
  approved $85.21 million investment, to complete the strategic point. The country
  intends to expand road network from Chabhar and intends to link up Zaranj-Delaram
  road to Afghanistan s  garland  road network that would connect port with major
  cities of Afghanistan, including capital Kabul. To extend sea route, the port will
  be developed by joint venture of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) and the
  Kandla Port Trust (KPT). To this end,  fully constructed berths will be released
  at Chabahar for a decade, which could be renewed by  mutual agreement.  Not surprisingly,
  the project also aims to keep an eye on the two rivals in the region Pakistan and
  China, though the latter is not declared one. Soon after the Chinese takeover of
  Gwadar, Indian apprehensions of  China encircling India  started to surface. Meanwhile,
  Pakistan views the growing Indian diplomatic and economic footprint in Afghanistan
  with suspicion and anxiety. Due to Pakistan s security concerns and geo-strategic
  sensitivities, so far India has resisted Kabul s demand for supply of heavy and
  offensive military hardware to ANF. Israel is deeply concerned about the prospects
  of a deal with Iran, demands stringent sanctions, and considers some restrictions
  on Iran s nuclear project as failure. Finally, India foresees the operationalization
  of port as a mean to hold global footprints, but the mighty China is more vigilant
  and pragmatic. For the first time in history, two Chinese warships docked at Iran
  s Bandar Abbas port to take part in joint naval exercises in the Gulf, endorsed
  by Iranian media and Chinese defence Minister. So far, there is little chance that
  Indian aspirations to emerge as a regional power will be fulfilled, in the presence
  of a mighty China and a challenging Pakistan. Saima Ghaznafer, Gujrat. China s string
  of pearls  Sir, China has long had the ambition of setting up a warm water port,
  and Gwadar is a strategic dream come true. China wants to set up outposts located
  along its energy lines across the globe to monitor and safeguard energy flows. Lin
  Boqiang, director of Energy Economics Research centre at Xiamen University, explained:  I
  do believe China will build the port at the astonishing  Chinese speed  to materialize
  the port s strategic values.  It offers a shorter route to western China via the
  recently expanded Karakoram Highway across Gilgit-Baltistan in northern Pakistan
  and an alternative route to vulnerable sea lanes through the Strait of Malacca.
  China is expected to build a naval base at Gwadar and its navy would maintain a
  regular presence there. The US sees Gwadar as part of China s strategy of building
  a  string of pearls  presence on the Indian Ocean. Gwadar is the most important
  of these pearls. Beijing has also developed Hambantota port in Sri Lanka and built
  a container port facility in Chittagong in Bangladesh. Baluchistan and Xinjiang
  are the largest, least developed and most restless provinces in Pakistan and China.
  Beijing and Islamabad have decided to start $18 billion China-Pakistan Economic
  Corridor connecting western China to South Pakistan. Other projects being started
  are a 15 mile tunnel connecting both countries and a fiber optic cable connecting
  Rawalpindi to China, and expansion of Karakorum Highway. A motorway from Gwadar,
  Balochistan to Kashgar in Xinjiang province is planned as well as a rail link connecting
  the two. China has agreed to invest $900.05 million to develop infrastructure projects
  on its own in Gwadar. Gwadar s development will also integrate Kech region and Turbat
  into the national mainstream due to its proximity with the region decreasing the
  effectiveness and the appeal of the Baloch fighters. Its natural layout and depth
  will enable large ships to dock, a characteristic absent in Dubai and Chahbahar.
  To facilitate rapid commercial and economic development special facilities will
  be provided like general tax-holidays, no VAT and generous incentives pertaining
  to business ownership and employment of foreigners. The purpose is to accelerate
  economic development and foreign and local investments. Gwadar will also serve as
  a regional oil refining hub due to its port capacity and land availability on the
  coast. It is planned to further develop Ormara naval base and port in Balochistan
  once Gwadar reaches 70% functional capacity. Gwadar will also support Ormara naval
  base in case any emergency, this will considerably extend Pakistan s sea control.
  Karachi has been quite unsuitable as a naval port as its shallow approaches require
  a long entrance channel which is easily susceptible to mining. Gwadar is meant to
  be the largest business centre of the world. Maritime security, trade and development
  through effective sea lanes are absolutely vital as sea power is of the greatest
  importance. Iqra Shahnaz, Rawalpindi. LBW  I bowl  no balls  I must tell you, So
  asked for some from GHQ, But the general said we don t love you And won t help me
  out with a friendly coup, Why Hashmi, damn him, let the cat out too, Of my cunning
  little bag, I just have no clue The big fixed match has just been seen through Now
  the pavilion crowds are ditching me too And I am only left with old TUQ Hence I
  m over and out, LBW, My tummy s churning, I need my Banni Galla loo Where an Oxford
  Saab can take a decent pooh, So  Youthias  I m off, leaving the match to you, When
  Azaadi s achieved, call me back, will you? Nooruddin Ahmed,  Aylesbury, UK.  '

heading: How nuclear weapons changed the face of conflict in South Asia
language: en

- ' Analysis'
text: ' May 2018 marked 20 years of India-Pakistan s bilateral nuclearisation, though
  Delhi s entry into the nuclear club through a benignly smiling Buddha dates back
  to 24 years. The May of 1998 steered the deeply-fissured conflict dynamics of South
  Asia to a new dimension. The world capitals, led by Washington DC, broke out in
  a flurry, not so much on India s second round of testing, but largely concerned
  with how Islamabad would react to the second Indian awakening. Extraordinary diplomatic
  outreach missions, incentives, threats of punitive action and thereafter implementation
  of wide-ranging sanctions post Pakistan s nuclearisation forever changed the strategic
  narrative for the actors concerned.  Given the widening conventional imbalance and
  persistent environment of conflict, Pakistan had to seek, and credibly manifest
  a power balancer, especially in the absence of an empathetic power broker. This
  may have been Pakistan s reason to shun the well-suited cloak of ambiguity, driven
  by the simplest logic that Pakistan s nuclear weapon programme was perceived differently
  by a range of stakeholders. For the domestic audience, depending on their level
  of comprehension, it was a weapon of ultimate strategic currency and an answer to
  all the problems with the enemy. For international actors, it was (and remains),
  a dangerous weapon in the hands of a developing country faced with arduous governance
  and security challenges, later compounded by ideologically-driven actors as well
  as proliferation concerns. While there was, and remains to date, a tacit acceptance
  of India s nuclearisation, the international actors would have been happier with
  a non-nuclear Pakistan. However, for better or for worse, the conflict binary between
  the two neighbours had now permanently altered. No longer could any crisis situation,
  big or small, between the two, go unnoticed on the US conflict radar. Whether or
  not either of the two actors  involved the US or any third actor to solicit their
  disputes, the latter s intervention in some manner appeared inevitable. Amongst
  many pressing concerns, the foremost remains the near absence of geographic distance
  between the nuclear armed neighbours that are home to one fourth of the global population.
  This left little time for preventing a perceived escalation in case of a nuclear
  exchange. Was the international community correct in its estimations? Are the nuclear
  weapons in the hands of Pakistanis a dangerous toy, for which they have little comprehension?
  How far has Pakistan travelled through this difficult path, where every action or
  measure taken in the strategic or even non-strategic realm has led the international
  community raise questions or concerns about Pakistan as a responsible nuclear weapons  state?
  Furthermore, what have we, as Pakistanis, learnt in these two decades of nuclearisation?
  These 20 years allowed Pakistan to create an elaborate strategic infrastructure,
  with a robust command and control system, catering to doctrinal aspects and endeavouring
  for a formal recognition for its programme   all of which has been no mean feat.
  Yet, there have been many challenges as well as lessons to learn. One important
  takeaway is that no longer can India-Pakistan conflict be perceived with the traditional
  security lens. Secondly, where at one time the US reluctantly engaged as the third
  party, the post-nuclear South Asia witnessed a highly proactive role in crisis diplomacy
  being played by Washington, which redefined US relations with the two South Asian
  neighbours. Overt nuclearisation of South Asia not only altered the context of the
  conflict, but also how the external actors independently, or in the role of mediators,
  now perceived the region These changing dynamics have been painstakingly documented
  and analysed by Dr Moeed Yusuf in his recent book Brokering Peace in Nuclear Environment
  US Crisis Management in South Asia, a publication by the Stanford University Press.
  Focusing primarily on three (and a half) crises between India and Pakistan, namely
  the 1999 Kargil, 2001-02 twin peaks, the 2008 Mumbai crisis, and lastly offering
  a brief analysis of the 2016 Uri crisis. Moeed has comprehensively covered various
  facets of the issue, starting with the unique dynamics of each of these crisis episodes.
  Although never fully in sync with Pakistan s expectations as an ally, the post 1998
  crises provide a much clearer understanding of when and how Washington gravitated
  closer towards New Delhi. The existing literature on India-Pakistan conflict trajectory
  has often drawn parallels with the Cold War bipolar rivalry between the super powers.
  This author very clearly debunks this myth by highlighting the critical role of
  the third party as a defining feature. The book not only focuses on the third party,
  primarily the US, performing the role of a mediator, guarantor of peace and crisis
  manager, but more specifically, discusses the strategy employed by conflict actors
  to create a demonstrative crisis hoping to lure third party support- angle in third
  party mediation and intervention, which has never been explored before. The author
  sees this as a reckless and dangerous prospect in a post-nuclearised environment,
  where the rules of engagement and competition demanded a mature and deeper contemplation
  of the situation. Comprising eight chapters, the book is divided into three portions.
  The first describes the theoretical framework and provides a detailed analysis of
  the literature generated on third party brokering and mediation. This underscores
  the hitherto missing link that crises may actually be generated to elicit the attention
  of a third party. This may be done for a number of reasons, from simply drawing
  the attention of international stake holders to the conflict, to reviving it, or
  to a transformation in the structure or context of the conflict. According to the
  author, the overt nuclearisation of South Asia not only altered the context of the
  conflict, but also how the external actors independently, or in the role of mediators,
  now perceived the region. The second portion covers three chapters, each dedicated
  to a singular crisis case study, i.e. Kargil, twin peaks and lastly the Mumbai crisis.
  This section provides the reader the strategic and diplomatic context that prevailed
  from the germination to the maturation of each crisis, how India and Pakistan perceived
  these singular events through their respective strategic lens. And last, but not
  the least, it outlines US  effective brokering, its concerns regarding escalation
  of crisis, explaining why and how Washington gradually but steadily aligned its
  interests with New Delhi, largely owing to Islamabad s singular pursuit of evoking
  third party intervention. The third and last portion of the book is based on a comprehensive
  analysis and possible repercussions of any deliberate or inadvertent crisis generation
  in a nuclear environment. There is also a brief analysis of the Uri Crisis and the
  resultant  surgical strikes  by India, which received customary lip service of crisis
  diffusion and management by Washington. Not only did it have its origins in the
  statements made by US policy makers during Mumbai, there in was a clear convergence
  of Delhi and Washington s interests and perspective. In this section, Yusuf also
  aptly discusses US brokered bargaining as a unipole in a range of other conflict
  dyads. Exemplifying the problem, he covers a spread of power differentials, regional
  contexts and security arrangements such as the Middle East (two friends  model i.e.
  Saudi Arabia vs Israel), the friend and foe prototype (i.e. Iran and Israel), the
  Korean and lastly, the Sino-Indian dyad. He draws parallels between various crises
  scenarios, while describing the differential power potential of belligerents, expectations
  of conflict parties in US potential to act as a superior or dominant broker. The
  author qualifies, that US as a sole super power may be faced with many challenges
  but for the foreseeable time it would maintain its supremacy and influence. This
  makes the US the most likely country to be seen as a mediator by regional or others
  actors, regardless of the clout gained by other global players. Moeed Yusuf s book
  not only provides a comprehensive insight into the role effectively played by the
  US as a third party   an aspect which has been discussed by other writers as well,
  but it makes a successful attempt at theorising why and how presence and role of
  the US impacts crisis behaviour in a nuclear environment. Would his deliberations
  help alter the behaviour patterns, influence the management, outcome of crisis and
  bring stability amongst the belligerents in times to come?  Why was there a need
  to examine this aspect, which, for example in the South Asian ambience, is taken
  for granted anyways? Yusuf responds by bringing forth two important factors. The
  first being the emergence of regional nuclear rivals; and second, the demise of
  Cold War bipolarity, paving the path for a unipolar system, establishing American
  preponderance. For those who seek to compare and find solutions for any of the regional
  nuclear crises from the Cold War super power rivalry model, one major point of departure
  was the absence of a more powerful third party to diffuse crisis or provide early
  warning between US and Soviet Union. The detailed analysis of each of the South
  Asian crises accentuates their distinctiveness, each a lesson in nuclear learning.
  Whereas the Kargil misadventure was conceived initially in a non-nuclear environment,
  for Pakistan which was beginning to learn the intricacies of nuclearisation, trying
  to fight a limited war under the nuclear shadow was a costly enterprise. In contrast,
  New Delhi s measured response reflected a mature behaviour. However, one must also
  remain cognisant of the fact that in comparison to Pakistan, India had 24 years
  of overt nulearisation  experience at hand. The author rightly points out the secrecy
  and exclusivity maintained by the architects of the operation, with little focus
  on how the international environment had altered. However, he does not offer any
  insights into why the budding body of Pakistani nuclear policy experts were not
  consulted before Kargil was initiated. The readers, through the successive chapters
  get a thorough insight into how Pakistan gradually learnt the nuances of nuclear
  politics, yet there was a visible disconnect to the changing regional trends. The
  growing discontent Pakistani establishment had with the US is guised either as a
  civil military detachment or Washington s bias towards New Delhi, without introspection
  as to how our decision makers need to closely focus on the rapidly changing strategic
  environment. This environmental change is manifested through many indicators, such
  as India s rise as an economic and political actor, the flagship India-US nuclear
  deal, the drawing power of economic engagement, US and India s convergence on anti-terrorism
  stance as well as New Delhi enjoying the status as the key player in Washington
  s broader Asia policy. The author, who is no stranger to the US decision making
  behaviour and nuances, also offers a clear read into the role played by other third
  parties, such as European states and mainly China, whose views seemed closely aligned
  with the US when it came to strategic crisis diffusion than otherwise. In conclusion,
  Moeed with his twin hats of working closely with the US policy circles and interacting
  equally closely with those in Pakistan, has through this book provided a very candid
  and honest analysis, of the nuclear crises between the two neighbours. He also tried
  to sensitise the reader to the inherent dangers of invoking deliberate third party
  intervention, terming it a counterproductive strategy in the longer run. Where the
  inclusion of nuclear weapons certainly provides the necessary deterrence, and correcting
  the military imbalance, the changing strategic environment requires a much deeper
  and holistic preparation, that involves political, economic, diplomatic as well
  as domestic security measures   the quintessential thresholds without which deterrence
  becomes vulnerable. Lastly, the US in the foreseeable future will retain direct
  stakes in preventing a regional crisis to escalate to the nuclear level; however,
  evoking demonstrative crises to elicit third part intervention may not always be
  a viable option. The author is an assistant professor at the Defence and Strategic
  Studies Department, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. She can be reached at salmamalik@qau.edu.pk '

- ' Report'
text: ' In a cautiously organised event in Islamabad, a modest group of lawyers, writers,
  activists and concerned citizens convened in a room. The air was so thick with political
  tension that a trip from the tea-station to the seats felt like wading through a
  pool of molasses. The meeting took place in a post-Taseer Pakistan where the Supreme
  Court has ruled that a discussion on reforming blasphemy laws is not blasphemy in
  itself, but a democratic right. The event was a discussion organised by the Digital
  Rights Foundation and it was initiated by the Executive Director, Nighat Dad. The
  panelists included Senator Dr. Ashok Kumar, Romana Bashir from the Peace and Development
  Foundation and Tooba Syed from the Awami Workers  Party (AWP). Nabiha Meher Shaikh,
  the event moderator, presented a report authored by Waqqas Mir titled  Blasphemy
  in the Digital Age    a comprehensive analysis of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan
  and their effects since they were modified in 1986 during General Zia-ul-Haq s reign.
  The editors of the report included Adnan Ahmed and Ms. Shaikh herself. Little disagreement
  was expressed about the need to penalise blasphemy. What s difficult to deny, however,
  is the culture of falsely accusing people of blasphemy   especially to settle personal
  scores. The law, in its current form, is used to disproportionately target religious
  minorities and others who are politically marginalised. There was instant agreement
  that nobody should have their fate decided by a frenzied mob Although it is understood
  that  false accusation  is not a problem unique to the crime of blasphemy, the consequence
  of wrongly accusing someone of blasphemy is markedly different from charging someone
  with having committed, say, tax fraud. The former sparks a fierce public reaction,
  often resulting in mob justice   or as one participant correctly renamed it,  mob
  violence , since there is no justice without trial. One by one, the panelists had
  their say. Dr. Kumar spoke of the hurdles to interfaith harmony in Pakistan. Romana
  Bashir mentioned the ease with which these accusations are made, in the helpful
  backdrop of a slide with a pie-chart depicting the number of blasphemy accusations
  before 1987 (only seven) against the number of accusations after the amendment (1,335).
  In Pakistan, protests against blasphemous content can quickly devolve into mob violence
  Tooba Syed, from the AWP, addressed the prejudice against religious minorities in
  the country, briefly mentioning the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and its
  slum eradication drive. She highlighted the grossly inappropriate remarks made about
  the Christian slum residents impinging upon the Muslim majority of the capital district.
  This was most pertinent to the discussion, as the reform of blasphemy laws must
  primarily be about the protection of minorities in a hostile climate. The digital
  age brings its own set of challenges, the report by Waqqas Mir explains. A blasphemy
  accusation can spread through the internet in a matter of seconds, making it frighteningly
  simple to rile people up against a specific person. Disrespectful material, posted
  anywhere in the world, is ignorantly utilised to cause social and political unrest
  in Islamic countries around the globe. Numerous examples were brought up of people
  who were threatened, accused and even killed for posting allegedly blasphemous blogs
  and tweets   including the tragic fate of a Facebook user on whose wall someone
  else had posted something supposedly disrespectful. The most famous case of outrage
  triggered by the online community is that of Junaid Jamshed. There was hardly a
  progressive citizen in the room who agreed with Jamshed s political and social views.
  And yet there was instant agreement that nobody should have their fate decided by
  a frenzied mob outside a courthouse. Instances of blasphemy   real or alleged- on
  the internet can worsen tensions in democratic societies A robust discussion ensued.
  Participants shared their experiences with false blasphemy accusations and proposed
  ways of addressing this challenge. The introduction of a libel law, to prosecute
  those who wrongly charge someone with blasphemy, appeared to be a popular suggestion.
  The need to humanise the victims of mob violence was noted. It was also discussed
  that there was a need for the law to differentiate between derogatory remarks made
  with clear intent, as opposed to those where the offense is implicit and accidental.
  It is enticing, in this situation, to cede more power to the government to ban potentially
  problematic sites. Waqqas Mir urged us to not fall to this temptation. Our descent
  into a state without privacy and freedom of information is not viable. The government
  must avoid broad actions like banning entire platforms out of fear of their misuse.
  We believe in a peaceful religion   that much we know. Why, then, do we sometimes
  have a difficult time acting on our most basic directive? Why is it that when a
  single Christian or Hindu Pakistani is accused of blasphemy, the entire community
  has to flee the area   for the well-founded fear of hate crimes or even genocide?
  Why do we cast a web so wide that along a handful of actual blasphemers, we trap
  thousands of innocent citizens, including lawyers performing their legal duty of
  representing the accused, as well as their families and religious kin? When we choose
  to assume the proud title of an  Islamic Republic , we take up the responsibility
  of demonstrating to the world what an Islamic society looks like. So are we a merciful
  society that levelheadedly tries those who are accused of disrupting social order?
  Or are we the republic that arbitrarily and often extra-judicially assaults its
  weakest members, making little effort to protect the innocent? A two-hour event
  and a 30-page report are perhaps insufficient to fully answer all these questions.
  But it s a start, and one must hope others are asking similar questions. '

text: ' If Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif thought he had weathered the storm kicked up
  by Imran Khan s dharna-demand for fresh elections, he has another thought coming.
  If he thought that his unspoken understanding with the PPP to jointly withstand
  attempts to dislodge the federal government before it completes its five year term
  was as good as gold, he must now wonder at the speed with which that alliance is
  unravelling. Indeed, if he thought he had restored the civil-military imbalance
  in his favour by abandoning the treason case against General Pervez Musharraf and
  consenting to General Raheel Sharif s demand to wage war against terrorism  on all
  fronts , he must now be worried by the political consequences for his federal government
  of the dangerous political direction that  popular  war is taking by targeting and
  alienating the MQM and PPP, which together represent the electoral mandate of Sindh.
  The verdict of the Judicial Commission was a great setback for the PTI. But much
  the same may be said of the PMLN s current position following judicial verdicts
  against it in three of the four hotly contested constituencies in Punjab that form
  the core of Imran Khan s demand for fresh elections. Indeed, if the JC took the
  wind out of Khan s sails, the fall of three wickets, including those of two key
  stalwarts of the PMLN, heralds an anxious time for Mr Sharif. Imran Khan has now
  been joined by Khurshid Shah, the leader of the opposition from the PPP, in demanding
  the resignations of the four provincial election commissioners for failing to conduct
  the 2013 elections with due diligence. The PTI has filed a reference against the
  four in the Supreme Judicial Council, which means that the matter is going to remain
  in agitation mode and on the front pages for the near future. The PMLN had originally
  decided to contest the electoral verdicts in the Supreme Court. That was a defensive
  tactic. But it has now decided to contest the by-elections and confront the PTI
  head-on in the court of the people. This is fraught with the great risk that if
  the PTI wins these seats, it is bound to become more aggressive in reasserting its
  demand for fresh general elections. Meanwhile, the first phase of local bodies elections
  for Punjab is scheduled for October 31. That will be a true test of the popularity
  of both the PTI and PMLN and will have a decisive say in the fate of the three NA
  constituencies in contention. Either way, the next three months could be make or
  break for one of them. The war against terrorism in Sindh is now moving into second
  phase by targeting corruption. This means, principally, the PPP government in the
  province. When second-tier PPP  administrators  were arrested by the Sindh Rangers
  some months ago, Mr Asif Zardari was frothing at the mouth. That led the Sindh government
  to consider terminating the Rangers  legal cover for operating in the province and
  only some last minute  negotiations  between the military, federal government and
  Sindh government stayed such a decision. Now the NAB-FIA Joint Investigation Team
  effectively under military command has arrested Dr Asim Hussain, a long time Zardari
  confidante and  business  associate, and compelled the Sindh Chief Secretary to
  seek bail before arrest from the Sindh High Court. This has set off alarm bells
  not just in Karachi but also in Islamabad. If the PPP Sindh government retaliates
  by withdrawing the writ of the Rangers, the military is bound to demand Governor
  s Rule in the province. Since that is easier said than done under the provisions
  of the 18th constitutional amendment, the military s ire may express itself in other
  provocative and destabilising ways. Meanwhile, the PPP is likely to explore ways
  and means of pressuring Mr Sharif to rein in the military or face the political
  prospect of losing its support against the PTI. As if all this isn t sufficient
  cause for concern, Mr Sharif must also contend with the domestic and international
  fallout of the aggressive Indian posture against Pakistan. He was hoping that a
  dialogue could be initiated via agreed proposals at Ufa. But the military has compelled
  him not just to oppose the Indian viewpoint on cross-border terrorism but also to
  demand talks on the Kashmir issue, which has effectively put paid to that hope.
  Mr Nawaz Sharif s relations with General Raheel Sharif have barely withstood the
  test of conspirators and agitators so far. But they are about to enter turbulent
  waters as the war against terrorism led by the military ruffles political feathers.
  Inevitably, this  war  will come closer to home in Punjab and Islamabad if it is
  to retain its  neutral  stance. That thought alone must give Mr Sharif sleepless
  nights no less than that of losing electoral ground to the PTI in the forthcoming
  local and by-elections, or politically alienating the PPP in Sindh. '

text: 'Monitoring Desk MANCHESTER: Just at the moment when all of England was celebrating
  Harry Kane s successful penalty in regulation time against Colombia, the Indian
  contingent at Old Trafford was celebrating a beautifully pulled six from KL Rahul.
  In the time it took for the referee in Moscow to clear the penalty area and allow
  Kane to take his spot-kick, Rahul had already hit three boundaries, leaving the
  usually unruffled Liam Plunkett spitting feathers. Twenty runs had come off that
  Plunkett over. That final-ball six was matched with another effortless flick over
  deep square leg, leaving India s captain Virat Kohli fawning  wow, wow  in the dug-out.
  The body positioning, the balance, the finesse, the placement: in a format where
  batsmen often bare muscular vulgarity, Rahul was portraying graceful strokeplay,
  using a technique taught to Test aspirants. The day had been already lit up by the
  resplendent strokeplay of Jos Buttler. But Rahul not only matched Buttler, he finished
  the job which the Englishman could not. Both men have a wide range of strokes, and
  can use their feet and the crease inventively. But if Buttler leaves you gasping
  with his daring and innovative strokeplay, Rahul arrests your attention with his
  drop-dead gorgeous strokes   like that fine, fine glide that he executed against
  Adil Rashid   too fine even for an already fine short third man. Or those cover
  drives underlined with the high elbow, a full face of the bat and a seamless followthrough.
  The biggest asset that Rahul possesses, and which catapults him above all competition
  for a spot in India s top and middle-order in limited-overs cricket, is the intent.
  Yes, Kohli s critics might cringe at the word, but intent while batting in T20 and
  ODI cricket clears many roadblocks mentally. In the first match on this trip, last
  week in Ireland, Rahul grimaced as a top-edge flew back to the bowler Kevin O Brien
  after he had lined up a premeditated single into the leg side. Rahul had reached
  70 by then with eight overs remaining, and knew he had missed out on an easy opportunity
  to get his second ton in T20Is. On Tuesday, he accomplished that feat to emulate
  Rohit Sharma, the only other Indian to have twin T20I centuries. In the IPL, Rahul
  had seen the benefits of hitting the first ball of an over for a boundary. When
  Chris Jordan faltered with an outswinger that came out as an over-pitched delivery,
  Rahul whipped a fluent cover-driven six off only his third ball of the innings.
  In the early part of Moeen Ali s first two overs, Rahul reverse-swept the offspinner
  for two fours and then charged down the pitch to loft two sixes, on both occasions
  over long-off. Two f-words best describe Rahul s brand of cricket: fearless and
  free-flowing. He had been promoted to the No. 3 position, usually reserved for Kohli
  or Suresh Raina, with the sole purpose of playing the aggressor role. Kohli, like
  England s captain Eoin Morgan, has been stressing the need for batsmen to perform
  flexible roles in the lead-up to the World Cup next year. It is a smart move in
  that Rahul can play the No. 3 role or anywhere else in the middle order because
  he can accelerate from ball one unlike Rohit or even Kohli, both of whom can take
  a little while to settle. Kohli later suggested that Rahul had been given freedom
  to play his natural game, knowing that India had the  cushion  of experienced batsmen
  in the middle order to follow him. It will be interesting to find out whether MS
  Dhoni played a role in this thought process. Mind you, Dhoni has utilised the same
  approach at Chennai Super Kings to promote the likes of Ambati Rayudu and Suresh
  Raina to the top order, allowing them to cut loose while he guarded the lower order.
  In 2011 World Cup, under Dhoni, India had three openers in Sachin Tendulkar, Virender
  Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir with Kohli at 4 and Raina doing the finisher s role with
  Dhoni. The question before India started their limited-overs leg in England was
  how could Rahul fit into the teams? With his blazing innings in his maiden match
  in England, Rahul has put a full stop to the debate.     Related '

  their local temperature records amid a wave of heat that is predicted to rise still
  further, the country s weather agency says. The highest temperature recorded Thursday
  was 45.2 degrees Celsius (113.4 Fahrenheit) near Abrantes, a town 150 kilometers
  (93 miles) northeast of the capital, Lisbon, the IPMA said. Temperatures in Portugal
  were forecast to keep building nationwide on Friday, to around 45 degrees, and to

  was 47.4 degrees (117.3 Fahrenheit) in 2003. Emergency services have issued a red
  alert, placing extra services such as medical staff and firefighters on standby
  through Sunday. In Portugal s southern Alentejo province, streets were largely deserted
  and some farmers chose to work during the night. Beaches around Lisbon, meanwhile,
  were packed. Temperatures were being driven higher across the Iberian peninsula
  by a hot air mass moving northward from Africa, which is also bringing dust from
  the Sahara Desert, meteorologists said. The dust gave the sky a dark yellow hue

  after warning that full-year sales will be lower than expected. Shares were trading
  down by almost 20% in Copenhagen at 11:45 BST, the lowest level since May 2014.
  Pandora has suffered as less people visit shopping centres, especially in its key
  US market. Known for its charm bracelets, Pandora is the world s largest jeweller
  by production volume. Pandora owns nearly 2,600 stores worldwide, but sales have
  dipped in its 600-plus stores in the UK and the US. A statement said the company
  intends to cut 397 of its 27,000 employees, as it expects sales will increase by
  between 4-7% this year, compared with the 7-10% it previously projected. Over half
  of the cuts will be made to its Thai workforce, with 218 staff members to leave
  the team. Pandora manufactures its jewellery across two factories in Bangkok and
  Lamphun, near Chiang Mai, where it employs roughly 13,000 people. It was founded
  in 1989 by Per Enevoldsen and his then wife Winnie. Profit warning S ren Hansen,
  senior analyst at Danish bank Sydbank, said this was a  large  profit warning, suggesting
  that   with various factors accounted for    underlying sales are actually declining
  .  Consumer behaviour is changing and retailers need to strike the right balance
  between physical and online stores,  Mr Hansen added. The company also cited  a
  headwind from currencies , suggesting it has also lost out due to a weaker exchange
  rate for the Danish kroner. Meanwhile, the firm is ramping up plans for new concept
  store openings in 2018 to 250   50 more than expected. It said that 50% of the shops
  will be opened in Europe, the Middle East and Africa with the remainder split between

text: 'Asad Umar, the lawmaker tipped to be the new finance minister, has promised
  to separate economic matters from politics and vowed to give administrative independence
  to key government institutions in a bid to turn around their fortunes and pave the
  way for boosting the economy. He said that his party government would appoint reforms
  oriented chairperson of Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR). H e also assured complete
  autonomy to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) the national data collecting agency
  that remained at the centre of controversy and allegations of manipulations of economic
  growth and data. While criticizing the mismanagement of PML-N government Asad Umar
  Said,  The first real relief can be given to the people is that economy will be
  run on fundamental rather than political gains. Transparency and austerity are the
  important fundamental of the economy. These are all pervading norms in developed
  countries. The hallmark of previous PML-n government was excessive discretionary
  spending, massive corruption in mega development projects and pilferage in funds
  doled out to law makers of the ruling party and allied parties, The World Bank and
  International Monetary Fund gave repeated warning against massive slippages in public
  expenditures. But their advice was sarcastically rejected. The reckless expenditure
  resulted in a fiscal deficit close to 7 percent of GDP. The deliberate rocking of
  the boat of the economy reflected in an unsustainable growth of 74 percent in public
  debt. The debt burden rose to 24.5 trillion or 72 percent of the total size of the
  economy the highest level of debt in 15 years due to the unscrupulous and corrupt
  economic management. If the rising trend of public debt is not contained, the debt
  level will further increase to 74 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The
  Public debt of Rs. 24.5 million includes Rs. 16.5 trillion domestic debts and external
  debt of Rs. 8 trillion, which is equal to $ 94 billion. The World Bank in its Report  South
  Asia Focus Fall 2017 issued in August that year forewarned the PML-N government
  to immediately initiate corrective measures to address the macroeconomic imbalance
  of bulging trade and budget deficits and ballooning public debt. But the planning
  minister Ahsan Iqbal, who was also de facto finance minister, showed obduracy and
  rejected the sane advice of international lending agencies. The new government would
  need to immediately follow the fiscal consolidation path by restricting expenditures
  and enforcing a radical plan for domestic revenue mobilization. Asad Umar has hinted
  in a current affairs programme of a private TV Channel that PTI government would
  slashed down the tax rate but expand the tax base by bringing potential tax payers
  who are so far out of the tax net. He said that reliance on regressive indirect
  taxes will be reduced. But it is pertinent to mention that in General Musharraf
  government the number of active tax payers was 2.4 million which dropped by 50 percent
  to 1.2 million in PML-N government. In 2017, 43 percent listed companies and registered
  partnership firms did not file tax return with the FBR. The tax amnesty on domestic
  and offshore assets did not yield the desired results. The active tax payers who
  have slipped out of the tax net have to be brought back and the available data of
  3.8 million wealthy people with the FBR should be utilized for imposition of tax.
  Another of grave concern is the snowballing power sector circular debt of Rs. 550
  billion. It does not include the power sector debt of Rs. 641 billion which has
  been parked in Power Holding Limited (PHL). The previous government paid a circular
  debt of Rs. 180 billion. Out this amount Rs. 80 billion were paid for the purchase
  of electricity and Rs. 100 billion for the idle capacity of thermal power plants
  owned by private power companies. The government had to pay Rs 22 billion as penalty
  for not making the payment of circular debt on time. A legal solution has to be
  sought to get out of the cobweb capacity clause of agreements made by Benazir Bhutto
  and Nawaz Sharif with private power producers for personal illegal monetary benefits
  at the expense of national interest. Administrative authority to PBS is inevitable
  because this government department was used by former finance minister Ishaq Dar
  to make projection of rosy picture of the economy with fudged data, whereas the
  economy was in shamble. PBS was not granted administrative approval to change the
  base year from 2007-08 to 2015-16 for accurate estimation of the growth of the economy.
  It is worth mentioning that in the United States, President Jimmy Carter adopted
  the method of  Zero Base  budgeting to avoid overstatement about the state of economy.
  Hopefully the new government will introduce economic reforms to turn around the
  economy and develop a Pakistani class of professionally competent legal experts
  to renegotiate and change the contracts with private power producers and the LNG
  agreement made with Qatar.   Related '

  on Tuesday. Addressing this function, he said that PTI agenda of change has gone
  beyond the billion trees Tsunami in the province. He enumerated the successful reforms
  in health, education and local government departments. He dwelt at length how the
  national treasure of forests was looted by the timber mafia. He said that provincial
  government had to fight tooth and nail against this very strong mafia which was
  pillaging the forest wealth. The Chief Minister said this was not an easy task because
  they succeeded to cut down trees worth Rs. 200 billion hiding behind the faulty
  wind fall law. The provincial government of Pakistan Tehrik Insaf has done a marvelous
  job by completing the plantation of 1.16 billion trees of different types over areas
  of 150,000 hectares. This achievement was made possible within a short span of one
  and a half year. Its credit goes to the dynamic, sincere and selfless leadership
  of Imran Khan, an untiring efforts and outstanding performance of the Chief Minister
  and his dedicated team. The most difficult task was how to break the vicious circle
  of timber mafia and retrieve from them 80 thousands Kanal of land for reforestation.
  The government is starting yet another mega project of tree plantation 6 Lac hectares
  and a comprehensive plan has been chalked out to utilize all the available land
  for the promotion of forestry by the year 2020. The project will benefit the province
  in a number of ways in the foreseeable future. It will go a long way in restoring
  the abnormally disturbed ecological balance and flourish forests to arrest the environmental
  degradation. A number of precious and beautiful wild life species are on the verge
  of extinction whereas some have already gone extinct. Hence, wild life will get
  a big boost. It will play a major contributory role in the conservation of flora
  and fauna.  Deforestation has immensely destroyed the natural habitats and this
  initiative will serve as rehabilitation and breeding ground for wild life that seems
  to be lost. The aesthetic beauty of KP will be back to life. This model of aforestation
  and re-forestation has been eulogized by the International Union of Conservation
  of Nature (IUCN) and is worth emulation for the other three provinces of the country.
  Bringing additional areas under forests play a leading role in mitigating the disastrous
  impacts of climate change. Quite recently, a world renowned think-tank of environmental
  protection, German-watch has ranked Pakistan 7th most vulnerable country to climate
  change. The global Risk Index of Pakistan is 1-10 which is alarmingly high. The
  unregulated vehicular traffic, non-implementation of global environment safety standards
  in cement, sugar and steel industries along with the vintage and dilapidated industrial
  technologies has abnormally polluted the air that we breathe.  Last but not the
  least the existing and planned thermal power plants in Punjab and Sindh using fossil
  fuel for their ignition will also add to the damage which is already on. The volume
  of the oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in addition to pollutant of organic
  nature like methane and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) has attained a dangerous level.  The
  recent dense smog content is a glaring example of our unawareness, deliberate ignorance
  and mismanagement of the Federal government. Replicating the KP model of reforestation
  and aforestation should be made mandatory in other provinces especially in Punjab
  in order to arrest the man made nuisance of environmental degradation and provide
  clean air for the people.  If the federal government still ignore the tell tale
  signs of this menace because smog and health problem like asthma and cancer, in
  not so distant future will just be a tip of the ice berg. Related '

  a provincial assembly seat. He submitted his papers for the National Assembly as
  well. Jam Kamal was elected MNA in 2013 as an independent candidate. But he later
  joined the PML-N government as a cabinet member. Jam Kamal heads the newly formed
  Balochistan Awami Party. He was instrumental in the decision of the MPAs to oust
  the PML-N chief minister in the Balochistan Assembly a few months ago. Prince Ahmed
  Ali: He is the grandson of the Nawab of Kalat. He was given a PML-N ticket in 2013.
  He joined the Jam Kamal-led BAP and became a minister. He has submitted his papers
  for Jam Kamal s National Assembly seat. Sardar Saleh Bhootani: He is a former caretaker
  chief minister. He has joined the the Balochistan Awami Party and will contest from
  his ancestral provincial assembly constituency of PB-49 (Kohlu). He has not, however,
  been able to persuade his brother, the former speaker of the assembly, Aslam Bhootani,
  to join his new party. Aslam Bhootani is going to stand for a National Assembly
  against Jam Kamal. Nawabzada Jangez Marri: He parted ways with the PML-N provincial
  government and also joined the BAP. He was a member of the provincial cabinet. Sarfaraz
  Bugti: This former home minister was elected as an independent candidate but joined
  the PML-N government and later the BAP. He is running for a provincial seat of Dera
  Bugti and has been given a BAP ticket. Mir Jan Jamali: This former chief minister
  and his daughter Rahat Jamali developed differences with the PML-N over the Senate
  election. He wanted to secure a senate seat for one of his daughters. He openly
  supported the no-confidence move against the PML-N chief minister and joined the
  BAP which gave him and his daughter a ticket. Mir Qudoos Bizenjo: He is a controversial
  chief minister. He won the last election with only 544 votes from Awaran. He was
  elected a PML-Q candidate but joined the PML-N-led provincial government. He was
  made chief minister after the existing one, Sanaullah Zehri, was voted out. He has
  also joined the BAP and is running under the same umbrella. Aslam Raisani: This
  former chief minister did not take part in the last general election after wrapping
  up five years as chief minister in the PPP-led provincial government in 2008. He
  is running as an independent candidate this time round. Lashkari Raisani: He is
  the brother of Aslam Raisani, and was a successful PPP candidate in the 2008 elections.
  In 2013, he was a candidate of the PML-N and this time he is running from BNP-Mengal.
  Izhar Khan Khoso and Abdul Ghafoor Lehri have left the PML-N and joined the BAP
  under the leadership of Jam Kamal Khan. Former PML-Q member Abdul Karim Nosherwani
  has joined the BAP as well and has a ticket for a provincial assembly constituency.

text: 'GAZA (AFP): At least nine Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured by
  Israeli security forces confronting one of the largest Palestinian demonstrations
  along the Israel-Gaza border in recent years, Gaza medical officials said. Tens
  of thousands of Palestinians, pressing for a right of return for refugees to what
  is now Israel, gathered at five locations along the fenced 65-km (40-mile) frontier
  where tents were erected for a planned six-week protest, local officials said. The
  Israeli military estimate was 30,000. Families brought their children to the encampments
  just a few hundred meters (yards) from the Israeli security barrier with the Hamas
  Islamist-run enclave, and football fields were marked in the sand and scout bands
  played.

  But as the day wore on, hundreds of Palestinian youths ignored calls from the organizers
  and the Israeli military to stay away from the frontier, where Israeli soldiers
  across the border kept watch from dirt mound embankments.  The military said its
  troops had used  riot dispersal means and firing towards main instigators.  Some
  of the demonstrators were  rolling burning tires and hurling stones  at the border
  fence and at soldiers. At least two of the dead were Hamas operatives, an Israeli
  military official said. Palestinian health officials said Israeli forces used mostly
  gunfire against the protesters, in addition to tear gas and rubber bullets. Witnesses
  said the military had deployed a drone over at least one location to drop tear gas.
  Gaza health officials said one of the nine dead was aged 16 and at least 400 people
  were wounded by live gunfire, while others were struck by rubber bullets or treated
  for tear gas inhalation. The Palestinian protest was launched on  Land Day,  an
  annual commemoration of the deaths of six Arab citizens of Israel killed by Israeli
  security forces during demonstrations over government land confiscations in northern
  Israel in 1976. Related '

heading: US suicide prevention programs say more funding needed
language: en
publisher: Geo News

text: 'NEW YORK: Efforts to fight suicide in the United States are desperate for additional
  funding, suicide-prevention experts said, following this week s high profile deaths
  of celebrities Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, and new statistics showing a growing
  problem. Federal funding for suicide trailed far behind other major public health
  issues, even though it is the 10th-leading cause of death among Americans, claiming
  one person every 12 minutes, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention.  Our crisis centers across the country are chronically underfunded,  said
  John Draper, executive director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which
  can be reached at +1-800-273-TALK and provides free support 24 hours a day. The
  National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided about $35 million in 2017 to fund research
  into  suicide prevention,  with another $68 million devoted to the category of  suicide,  according
  to the agency s statistics. There were 45,000 US suicides in 2016. In comparison,
  alcoholism, which killed an estimated 65,000 Americans in 2015, saw $500 million
  in funded research last year. Private charities, which help sustain suicide prevention
  hotlines, also have a harder time raising funds than those that tackle some other
  health issues, experts said.  Look at breast cancer. More people will die by suicide
  than breast cancer this year,  said Dan Reidenberg, executive director of the nonprofit
  Suicide Awareness Voices of Education. Almost $690 million was spent on breast cancer
  research last year, according to NIH statistics. The United States has one of the
  highest rates of suicide in the world, according to World Health Organisation data.
  In 2015, the United States had a rate of 15.3 suicides per 100,000 people, well
  above the global average of 10.6 per 100,000, according to WHO. Bourdain, a chef
  and host of CNN s  Parts Unknown  food-and-travel show, died of an apparent suicide
  on Friday in a French hotel. Spade, a fashion designer known for her popular handbags,
  was found dead in her apartment on Tuesday after what her husband described as a
  long battle with depression. Scientists are making progress in identifying ways
  of predicting suicide risk more precisely, including biomarkers that could indicate
  whether someone is more likely to attempt it, said Jane Pearson, chairwoman of the
  National Institute of Mental Health s suicide research consortium. Undiagnosed mental
  health problems, stresses such as loss of a job or a loved one, relationship problems,
  financial difficulties and physical problems can contribute to suicide, experts
  said.  It s usually a confluence of factors,  said Jerry Reed, a member of the executive
  committee of the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention.  We have to be mindful
  of the whole spectrum.  Research has shown that direct intervention, much like the
  use of suicide hotlines, can help people contemplating suicide to change their minds,
  National Suicide Prevention Lifeline s Draper said. The key is to think of suicide
  as a public health issue, much like diseases such as AIDS or cancer, said Christine
  Moutier, the chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.
  While tragic, the deaths of Spade and Bourdain could help spread the message that
  suicides can be prevented, experts said.  It definitely is a teachable moment,  Pearson
  said '

  a statement Friday debunking claims that a viral text message   containing quoted
  advice to "refrain from drinking any cold drink in the Ramadan"   was not, in fact,
  issued by facility''s founder. "Some mobile sms messages are in circulation attributing
  [Dr Syed Adeeb-ul-Hasan Rizvi], Director Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation
  (SIUT) to the use of some commercial soft drinks especially during Ramzan," the
  notice reads.  "Dr Adib Rizvi & SIUT has not issued any such statement," it added.    The
  circular added that a similar incidence had happened in 2017 as well, forcing the
  SIUT''s team to issue a similar statement then too.  "Similarly sms had appeared
  last year in Ramzan. Dr Rizvi and SIUT had issued a similar denial regarding this
  sms," it noted. The said message   being circulated on social media, mobile applications
  such as WhatsApp, and text messaging service   contains the following: "Civil Hospital
  s head Dr. Adib Rizvi, Kidney specialist requests all Muslims to refrain from drinking
  any cold drink in the Ramadan. "He says after fasting the whole day the kidneys
  get dehydrated and as all cold drinks contain gas, by drinking cold drink, your
  kidneys could fail. All cold drinks such as coke, Pepsi, Fanta, Miranda, 7up, Sprite,
  Mountain Dew etc. Must avoid at all costs. Rather drink a fresh juice. Before Ramazan
  please send this message to all.Muslims you know," the text adds. The renowned philanthropist
  and the SIUT''s founder was part of a committee, alongside former attorney general
  Munir A Malik, that presented its recommendations late last month to curb the illegal
  organ trade in Pakistan. SIUT''s Dr Adeeb Rizvi hospitalised for chest pain treatment

  over 1,000 people are killed in different incidents and accidents in a year and
  there s a need to use the organs of the deceased,  he had said earlier. In March,
  Dr Rizvi, who believes people will continue to be affected by kidneys diseases if
  diabetes and high blood pressure were not treated, was awarded the Nishan-e-Imtiaz.
  Last year, in December, he was hospitalised for treatment of chest infection and
  influenza. Dr Rizvi had stayed in a high-dependency unit for three days but was
  later moved to a private room, a statement issued by the SIUT had noted. '

  after the government accepted their demands on Friday.  The protesters had earlier
  warned of halting the metro bus if a notification for their service structure is
  not issued.  A spokesperson of the lady health workers announced to end the strike,
  stating that their demands had been accepted by the government and a notification
  of the same had been issued   a condition the protesters had put forth earlier on.  The
  health workers, who had been spending nights and days on Mall Road in protest, had
  said they would not end their sit-in until their demands are met. The protest has
  disrupted traffic in Lahore as the protesters have occupied the main thoroughfare
  of the city. The sit-in near Charing Cross had also polluted the area with trash
  all around that the protesting health workers have been clearing and burning on
  their own. Court orders sit-in be ended   Earlier in the day, Lahore High Court
  ordered the home secretary to clear the sit-in and submit and report on the matter
  by April 2. The court also questioned the home secretary on why the protest had
  not ended by now.  On March 26, the workers started a sit-in outside the Punjab
  Assembly over non-payment of salaries. Lady health workers  protest in Lahore enters
  third day Mall Road turns into garbage dump as waste management staff has not yet
  cleaned thoroughfare  We haven t been paid for five months now,  a protester said.
  While another added saying that they last received an increment in 2012.  Our demonstration
  will continue till our demands are met,  a health worker stressed. Following this,
  the government allowed the release of arrears worth Rs1.2 billion for the lady health
  workers. The amount will reach the health workers within 15 days. The health workers
  had been protesting for a few years for various reasons, including those pertaining
  to their upgradation, regularisation or non-payment of salaries, across Pakistan.
  However, no proper system has been put in place for the workers to continue their
  duty in a smooth manner. '

  a source familiar with the situation.  The report, quoting another source, states
  that Washington had earlier requested Islamabad to extradite Afridi to the US. The
  source went on to suggest that Afridi''s release and extradition is crucial for
  other CIA operations in Asia. After his detention in 2011, Afridi was sentenced
  to 33 years for involvement in anti-state activities by a tribal court in 2012.  However,
  the sentence was later reduced. Afridi was recently shifted, as per media reports,
  from Peshawar to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi due to security concerns.  Dr Shakil

  familiar with the situation told Sputnik the doctor was placed in another jail because
  of the planned prison break. His brother and lawyer have claimed the move precedes
  his release from prison as he has served the minimum sentence.   The CIA, in turn,
  refused to comment on news that Pakistani intelligence thwarted the agency''s plan
  to orchestrate a prison escape for Afridi.  Also on Monday, a US Department of State
  official told Sputnik that Washington hopes that the Pakistani authorities will
  take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of Shakeel Afridi. "Pakistan has

text: 'YORK: Many churchgoers said they were sickened and saddened by a grand jury
  report detailing widespread sexual abuse by hundreds of priests in Pennsylvania
  but they would not let the Roman Catholic Church s cover-up dissuade them from their
  faith. Nearly 200 parishioners filled almost all the pews for Saturday s Mass at
  St. Patrick s Church in York, Pennsylvania, where six priests who at one time worked
  in that parish are accused in the report of sexually abusing children.  I can t
  talk about it without crying,  said Kathy Morris, a retired steelworker and a member
  of St. Patrick s for over 15 years.  I m going to Mass to try to find some peace.   I
  m disappointed that it happened but as far as the faith goes, I ll never give my
  faith up,  said Anthony Giuffrida, 66, an usher and lifelong member at St. Patrick
  s.  I was raised Roman Catholic and that s what I ll be till the day I die.   Few
  people attended the 9 AM service at St. Margaret Mary in Harrisburg where the report
  accuses Rev. Richard Barry of abusing boys in the 1980s. The parking lot was nearly
  empty, and a busload of seniors from a retirement community were among the few who
  entered the church. Most attending the Mass declined to comment or made brief statements
  without giving their names.  Our faith goes on,  one woman said. The grand jury
  report was the most comprehensive report on clergy abuse in American history, accusing
  hundreds of priests in six of Pennsylvania s eight dioceses of assaulting children
  for decades while the diocese covered it up, often sending priests to treatment
  centres and reassigning them to different parishes. The results of the grand jury
  s two-year investigation were the latest revelation in a scandal that has shaken
  the Catholic Church since the Boston Globe in 2002 reported on decades of clergy
  abuse and the attempt by the diocese to cover it up. Allegations of clergy abuse
  in Europe, Australia and Chile have also emerged and prompted the resignation of
  several leaders within the Church, which has about 1.2 billion members worldwide.
  Rev. Keith Carroll of St. Patrick s Church said in his sermon Saturday that  What
  is contained in that report is sickening and saddening.  He said he was  struggling
  personally  with  anger, utter embarrassment and sadness.  Carroll implored his
  parish to not spurn the church because of the grand jury s findings:  Only God himself
  can bring us out of this darkness.  Many churchgoers echoed Carroll s hope that
  Catholics would not abandon their faith out of disgust with the church leadership
  s past behaviour. Over 3 million people, about a quarter of Pennsylvania s population,
  are Catholic according to the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference. Over 100 people
  attended Sunday Mass at St. Columba Church in Bloomsburg, formerly the parish of
  Rev. James Beeman whom the report accused of raping a 7-year-old girl while she
  was in the hospital.  I m praying for our church community to hold onto our faith
  because that s still the best thing we have,  said parishioner Mary Howe, 63, who
  has been a member at St. Columba since 1956. Victims and their advocates said they
  were grateful that the report outed so many abusive priests. The report cited 301
  priests, some of whom have died. Only two of the priests are still subject to prosecution.  This
  is only the tip,  said Mary McHale, 46, who testified before the grand jury and
  said she was abused by Rev. James Gaffney at her Catholic high school in Reading.  It
  just multiplied inside me over the years. The shame and the guilt and the low self-esteem,
  that never leaves you.  McHale supports her former classmate and state Representative
  Mark Rozzi, who said he was raped by his parish priest and is pushing to change
  a law to give victims of child sex abuse more time to file claims against their
  abusers. State legislators expect to take up the bill in September, said Steve Miskin,
  a spokesman for House Majority Leader Representative Dave Reed. '

text: 'SANAA: A series of explosions Thursday on Yemen''s rebel-held port city of
  Hodeida killed 55 civilians and wounded dozens of others, the Red Cross said, denouncing
  the "reprehensible" disregard for human life.  "While the exact circumstances around
  the ground explosions are still unknown, this lack of respect for civilian life
  and civilian property is reprehensible," said Johannes Bruwer, the head of the delegation
  in Yemen for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in a statement
  Friday. The Red Cross said 55 civilians were killed and 170 injured "when a series
  of explosions rocked densely populated districts of the coastal city, including
  a fish market and the area around Al-Thawra Hospital"   a facility supported by
  the ICRC. Two ambulances were also destroyed, it said. On Thursday, medics and witnesses
  said at least 20 people were killed in an air strike at the entrance to a hospital
  and the bombardment of a fish market in the Red Sea city of Hodeida. "The scenes
  coming from Hodeida are horrific. The disregard of international humanitarian law
  in Yemen cannot be tolerated," said Bruwer, condemning the attacks. Lise Grande,
  the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, earlier said hundreds of thousands of
  people depend on Al-Thawra, the country''s largest hospital. "This is shocking,"
  she said of the attacks. Yemeni government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition
  have been conducting an offensive to capture Hodeida from Iran-backed Houthi rebels
  but announced last month they were pausing the assault to give UN mediation efforts
  a chance. Strikes have picked up again around Hodeida since the Saudis last week
  said that two oil tankers operated by one of the kingdom''s companies were attacked
  in the waters of the Red Sea. Rebel-run media outlets accused the Saudi-led coalition
  of carrying out the attacks in Hodeida. But the coalition''s spokesman, Turki al-Maliki,
  on Friday denied the charges, accusing the Houthis of having bombed the hospital
  and the fish market. The nearest target hit by the coalition on Wednesday or Thursday
  was more than two kilometres (1.2 miles) away from the two sites, Maliki told a
  news conference in Riyadh. '

  \ reluctant to extend the paramilitary force\u2019s powers, citing reservations\

  \ August 12 and because of that, a summary sent to the chief minister for extending\
  \ the paramilitary force\u2019s powers could not be signed.He said the provincial\
  \ assembly members would discuss during the session as to whether Rangers\u2019\

  \ as the paramilitary force has played an important role in the fight against terrorism.\"\
  Khuhro said the provincial government had sought Rangers\u2019 assistance in restoring\
  \ peace in Karachi and the crackdown on criminals in the city had helped in controlling\
  \ extortion, kidnapping and murder cases.\"The local government elections were conducted\

text: "Mental health lawyer explains differences in addictions and habits\n      \
  \                      Karachi Putting simply, with a habit you are in control of\
  \ your choices but with an addiction you are not, mental health lawyer Inamullah\
  \ Ansar told The News. He said there was a psychological or physical component in\
  \ addictions; the person is unable to control the aspects of the addiction without\
  \ A help because of the mental or physical conditions involved but a habit is by\
  \ choice. \u201CThe person with the habit can choose to stop, and will subsequently\
  \ stop successfully if he wants to. The psychological or physical component is not\
  \ an issue with a choice as it is with an addiction. Addiction to substances or\
  \ activities can sometimes lead to serious problems at home, work, school and socially.\
  \ The causes of addiction vary considerably, and are not often fully understood.\
  \ They are generally caused by a combination of physical, mental, circumstantial\
  \ and emotional factors,\u201D Ansar elaborated. The mental health lawyer pointed\
  \ out that people with addictions struggle not only with uncomfortable symptoms\
  \ and complex lifestyle issues, but also with the stigma, discrimination and disability\
  \ which causes so many to live in secrecy, rarely if ever revealing the true nature\
  \ of their addictive behaviour. With a better understanding of addictions, those\
  \ involved in addictive behaviours, as well as their families and loved ones can\
  \ gain new hope, and begin to take control of their own lives. \u201CTherefore,\
  \ addiction is not about drugs, it\u2019s all about the brains. It is not the substances\
  \ a person uses that make them an addict; it is not even the quantity or frequency\
  \ of use. Addiction is about what happens in a person\u2019s brain when they are\
  \ exposed to rewarding substances or rewarding behaviours, and it is more about\
  \ reward circuitry in the brain and related brain structures than it is about the\
  \ external chemicals or behaviour that \u201Cturn on\u201D that reward circuitry,\u201D\
  \ he explained. Ansar is associated with the National Alcoholism, Drug Addiction\
  \ and Psychiatric Disorders Rehabilitation House in Karachi that provides a diverse\
  \ educational curriculum on the prevention, intervention, counseling, treatment\
  \ and recovery management of addictions that affect various genders, generations,\
  \ and cultures.  \u201CIt\u2019s a project of Pakistani and UAE mental health lawyers,\u201D\
  \ he went on to say. \u201CThe rehabilitation house is providing advice to ensure\
  \ extension of special assistance and due care extending maximum assistance and\
  \ priority to senior citizens, disabled and handicapped persons in using their legal\
  \ needs as far as possible in meeting their genuine requirements in order to alleviate\
  \ their hardship,\u201D he added. \u201CWe are a technology\u2014savvy attorney\
  \ and settle cases faster and maximize using powerful capabilities online as well\
  \ as in courtroom, boardrooms and screening rooms offering best practices to create\
  \ dynamic results that organize and present case material(s) that leave no room\
  \ for disputes.\u201D Ansar is a licensed practitioner, care coordinator teaching\
  \ in the field of addictions and concurrent disorders. \u201CIt\u2019s a project\
  \ of a longitudinal study of many untreated heavy drinkers and their relatives in\
  \ Pakistan. We have provided treatment to people with concurrent addictions and\
  \ mental health problems,\u201D he said. \u201CWe have also held roles in alcohol,\
  \ drug problems, gambling prevention and community-based dual diagnosis support\
  \ services,\u201D the lawyer concluded."

  \ days;  directs ministry to place it on website\nISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC)\
  \ on Tuesday asked why the Haj policy was being concealed sought the draft of Haj\
  \ Policy, 2017 within the seven days and directed the federal government to place\
  \ the policy on the website of Ministry of Religious Affairs.\nA three-member bench\
  \ of the apex court headed by Justice Mushir Alam heard the contempt petitions filed\
  \ by the Tour Operators who have not been registered for granting haj quota since\
  \ 2012 as well as contempt petitions, filed against the policy of 2013 and 2015.\n\
  Counsels for the petitioners contended that the government is not drafting haj policy\
  \ in accordance with the apex court judgment.\_ They submitted that in Dosani Travels\u2019\
  s case, the apex court while giving certain directions, had ruled that the haj policy\
  \ should be framed, announced and placed on the website of Ministry of Religious\
  \ Affairs (Mora), preferably within six weeks of the arrival of last flight hajis\
  \ from KSA under intimation to the Registrar of the apex court.\nThis of course\
  \ would be subject to any policy decision of the Saudi government regarding allocation\
  \ of haj quota for Pakistan, the court had ruled .It was directed the haj policy\
  \ should be framed by a committee headed by the Secretary Ministry of Religious\
  \ Affairs, a nominee of the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP), a nominee\
  \ of the secretary Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a nominee of the secretary Ministry\
  \ of Law and Justice Divisions and Parliamentary Affairs, and a nominee of the Attorney\
  \ General for Pakistan.\nThe court had directed that credentials of each applicant/\
  \ HGO should be examined and decision taken on merit. The court had ruled that while\
  \ framing the Haj policy, the MORA should be guided, inter alia by the recommendation\
  \ made by the CCP to which reference has been made in at above para, and the Mora\
  \ should constantly monitor the working at performance of each HGO during Haj and\
  \ this assessment should form basis for further improvements in Haj policy for next\
  \ years haj.\nOn Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Sohail Mahmood told the court\
  \ that after Dosani Travels judgment, another judgment was also issued wherein,\
  \ the apex court had observed that the government had substantially complied with\
  \ its judgment.\nHe further submitted that the contempt petitions got anfractuous\
  \ regarding Haj policies of 2015 and 2016 saying the pilgrims already performed\
  \ haj under these policies. The court observed that every year, the issue of haj\
  \ came to surface only in Pakistan.\nCounsels for private tour operators told the\
  \ court that since 2012 they have not yet been registered. The court was informed\
  \ that there are about 742 tour operators having Haj quotas but some 2,033 tour\
  \ operators are without Haj quota since 2012.\nDeputy Attorney General however,\
  \ informed the court that the government was already facing shortage of quota adding\
  \ that in 2012, some companies had defaulted due to which he government got 910\
  \ Haj quotas.\nThe said quota, he said was awarded to those 19 companies which topped\
  \ the merit list. Sohail Mahmood informed the court that the new haj policy for\
  \ 2017 has been drafted and being forwarded to the prime minister for approval.\
  \ At this, Justice Qazi Faiz, a member of the bench, observed that the government\
  \ would purposefully finalise the policy at the last moment.\_\nHe questioned as\
  \ to whether the prime minister is required to do everything, adding as to what\
  \ is the government doing. The court directed that the Ministry of Religious Affairs\
  \ should place the 2017 Haj Policy on its website besides submitting its daft with\
  \ its Registrar office. The Deputy Attorney General assured the court that even\
  \ if the draft of the new Haj policy was not approved by the prime minister within\
  \ seven days, they will submit it before the court. Meanwhile, the court adjourned\
  \ the case for a week."

text: "Remembering Jaun Elia\nKarachi\nFor all those who complain that Karachi\u2019\
  s literary scene is going nowhere, it was commendable to see a houseful as despite\
  \ the fear of rain, many turned up to attend a candid gathering at The Second Floor\
  \ (T2F) on Sunday evening,\_ honouring the memory of poet Jaun Elia.\nModerated\
  \ by author Mohammed Hanif, the panel saw renowned faces from the literary circle\
  \ including poet Zahida Hina, Peerzada Qasim, journalists Wusutullah Khan and Peerzada\
  \ Salman and Asif Farrukhi and Khalid Ansari.\nReminiscing about the days spent\
  \ with Jaun, Zahida Hinda spoke about how he started calling him \u2018Bubu\u2019\
  \ later because the word was used to refer an elder sister in his village Amroha:\
  \ \u201CI used to be worried about his wealth and inquired about his appetite because\
  \ he seldom ate dinner on the prescribed time rather he would always ask me to pack\
  \ it all together. I was later told that he used to have his food much later into\
  \ the night hence never ate earlier.\u201D\nShe mentioned that as a poet, Jaun was\
  \ well read and kept himself updated: \u201CHe was a thorough poet who knew the\
  \ weight of words in a couplet and would point out if the word was not suited in\
  \ a line.\u201D\nPeerzada Qasim who first saw Jaun at a Mushaira said Jaun was famous\
  \ in circles even before his first work was published but he felt that the people\
  \ didn\u2019t know the other side of Jaun\u2019s poetry which was more than the\
  \ couplets limited to existentialism.\nQasim referred to Jaun\u2019s ghazals which\
  \ had a longing for the past and delved into the nostalgia often seen in romanticism:\
  \ \u201CJaun had a vast knowledge about many subjects and it is told that he taught\
  \ Bible in his house and often that literariness is ignored by many.\u201D\nReiterating\
  \ Qasim\u2019s point, Wusutullah Khan said that Jaun\u2019s grasp over various subjects\
  \ can be verified from the fact that he never repeated the content of a topic which\
  \ he had already stated; rather he would always come up with something novel.\_\
  \ Khan added that thanks to the social media, Jaun was not anyone\u2019s property\
  \ and people from places like Mian Chunnu held sittings discussing the poet.\nKhalid\
  \ Ansari, who had collected and published Jaun\u2019s works, said that Jaun even\
  \ had fans in Afghanistan and Patna where the people were curious about the poet\
  \ who was being widely read.\n\u201CWhen I met Jaun, I was barely a teenager and\
  \ although Jaun didn\u2019t mind me sitting with him he warned me that I wouldn\u2019\
  t be able to pace with the current times, and I realised his words after his death\
  \ that I was far ahead as compared to my contemporaries,\u201D he recounted.\nGiven\
  \ that Ansari was responsible for publishing Jaun\u2019s poetry and prose, he told\
  \ that Jaun had given him the job of rewriting his poems because of his handwriting\
  \ but he was able to reach out to him after a gap of five years.\nAfter dedicating\
  \ two of Jaun\u2019s couplets to Sabeen Mahmud, Peerzada Salman who is also a poet\
  \ said that he did not agree with the use of word \u2018cult\u2019 for Jaun: \u201C\
  He is a canonical figure and limiting him to \u2018cult\u2019 would be unjust.\u201D\
  \nHe added that most gatherings held for Jaun were merely sittings to remember Jaun\u2019\
  s witticism and often his poetry and seriousness was ignored.\nReferring to an incident\
  \ about Jaun\u2019s unpredictable nature, Asif Farrukhi narrated an incident when\
  \ Jaun broke down after he saw Farrukhi\u2019s father watering plants telling him\
  \ how he could do so for he had left his roots behind.\nBut when it was said that\
  \ Jaun need not be restricted to quips, Asif pointed out that we tend to trivialise\
  \ people and the harsh times in Jaun\u2019s life are not unknown to people: \u201C\
  Once Jaun was supposed to recite in a Mushaira but he refused to do so, upon asking\
  \ he revealed that he would have read out the poem he wrote a day earlier and going\
  \ to the recital would come at the cost of the poem he would write that very day.\
  \ So this was the same Jaun who was so concerned about his poetry as well.\u201D\
  \nLater the attendees read out different couplets and shared their experiences of\
  \ coming across Jaun and how his poetry cast an impact on their lives."

  \ Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project has now entered into terminal phase with 100\
  \ percent perfect design, new CEO of NJHP Brig (R) Engineer Muhammad Zareen said.\n\
  \u201CAt the very outset, the project was conceived in haste with poor design to\
  \ garner the water priority rights of Neelum River as at that time India had started\
  \ working on Kishenganga project on the same river. In 2006-07, the design was revamped\
  \ after catastrophic earthquake that hit AJK, KP and northern parts of the country\
  \ in 2005,\u201D Zareen told The News.\_\nWhen his attention was drawn towards recent\
  \ uttering of Wapda Chairman Lt Ge (R) Muzammil Hussain unravelling that the Neelum-Jhelum\
  \ project design was poor, Zareen explained that the chairman wanted to mention\
  \ the design carved out for the project was poor at the time when it was initiated\
  \ with an aim to get water property rights of Neelum River.\_\nHowever, after the\
  \ earthquake, the project\u2019s design was revamped and even after that some changes\
  \ were made. Zareen defended the statement of Wapda chairman arguing that he (chairman)\
  \ had pinpointed that the design was poor which meant that at the earlier stages\
  \ the design was not up to the mark which was improved gradually. \u201CNow the\
  \ project is on way to completion with 100 percent perfect design,\u201D Zareen\
  \ stressed.\nZareen agreed with the dividends of tunnel boring machine (TBM), but\
  \ at the same breathe he said that if it were included at the time of tender design,\
  \ the price of TBM would have been more affordable with more dividends.\nHowever,\
  \ the top Wapda officials who have been part of the project of strategic importance\
  \ from scratch to the 85 percent completion said that at the time of tender design,\
  \ the dividends of TBMs were not worked out at the global level.\nBut when it came\
  \ to knowledge that in Switzerland a tunnel was excavated through the TBM, the then\
  \ Wapda chairman Shakeel Durrani sent an experts\u2019 team to Switzerland to know\
  \ the benefits of using TBM. After the visit, the then president of Pakistan Asif\
  \ Zardari was briefed over the TBM\u2019s importance for early completion of the\
  \ project and he gave Wapda chairman a go-ahead. So the board of directors of Neelum-Jhelum\
  \ Hydropower Company headed by Shakeel Durrani approved procuring the TBM for the\
  \ project.\nWapda officials went on to say that Neelum-Jhelum Hydro Power Project\
  \ is a world class hydro power facility being executed under the deep mountains\
  \ where geology is neither predictable nor readable. They said never in Pakistan\
  \ has such a complex project, which is 80 percent underground, been developed. There\
  \ are strategic water issues involved that is why it was not developed earlier.\
  \ These types of mega projects can only be executed with speed if projects are planned\
  \ well and huge outlays are made available in time and political will prevails with\
  \ a consistent thrust. All said and done, NJHPP has achieved 85.5 percent progress\
  \ and is heading towards completion despite all delays in release of funds, weather\
  \ conditions, non-availability of power during early stage of construction and delays\
  \ in land acquisition.\nThe project has been conceived very well starting from 1983-85\
  \ where Wapda itself identified the proposed location for NJHPP in which Wapda team\
  \ under the caption of NJ-Kohala Hydel Complex was conceived and then M/s Nor Consult\
  \ (Norway) carried out a fresh feasibility study in 1993. These recommendations\
  \ led to the finalised study (December 1996) where the project texture was enhanced\
  \ from 550MW to 969MW and power house shifted to Chattar Klass.\nThe design of the\
  \ project has been prepared under the leadership of the reputed consultants M/s\
  \ Montgomery Watson Harza (MWH) and directly supervised by a world class panel of\
  \ experts from Pakistan and abroad.\n\_\n\_"

  \ Leader in the National Assembly Syed Khursheed Shah on Monday said PTI chief Imran\
  \ Khan had earlier termed the MQM an anti-state party and now he was eating his\
  \ own words by seeking its votes.\n\u201CImran Khan should tender an apology first\
  \ of all for disgracing the people of Karachi because it is on record that he had\
  \ termed the Karachiites sheeps and goats for listening to Altaf Hussain\u2019s\
  \ speeches and declaring the MQM an anti-state party. Today, the same Imran Khan\
  \ is eating his own words and is going to the MQM to seek its votes. Imran has no\
  \ agenda other than annihilating the system, but the PPP has the agenda of continuity\
  \ of democracy and taking the country forward,\u201D he said while talking to the\
  \ media here. He said parliament alone was the symbol of vibrant democracy.\n\u201C\
  If there is any problem over the appointment of chairman NAB, then its solution\
  \ lies with parliament and its 12-member committee. This committee comprises eight\
  \ MNAs and four senators. The government and the opposition have an equal\_ representation\
  \ in this 12-member committee, as it consists of six members each from both sides.\
  \ If the voting result comes out 50-50, then the matter is sent to the Election\
  \ Commission. If it remains unresolved at the level of election commissioner, then\
  \ the Supreme Court decides the matter,\u201D he said.\nHe said the PPP never indulged\
  \ in dishonesty. He said removing the opposition leader from his slot was a new\
  \ tradition. \u201CI have worked honestly as the opposition leader for four years\
  \ and fully discharged my obligations,\u201D he said. He said there should be no\
  \ contradiction between the words and practice of a politician, otherwise how he\
  \ would lead the nation. He said if there was someone better for the post of the\
  \ opposition leader, he will not raise any objection to his appointment. He further\
  \ claimed that he always tried to unite the opposition and welcomed everybody\u2019\
  s suggestions. He said every action of PTI and Imran Khan had strengthened Nawaz\
  \ Sharif.\nCriticising Imran, he asked how a leader who had failed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\
  \ could successfully run the country.\_ Appreciating Nawaz Sharif\u2019s decision\
  \ to return home, he said: \u201CI had told the media that Nawaz Sharif should return\

text: "Nawaz to deliver lecture on UK-Pak relations in British parliament\n\nLONDON:\
  \ Britain\u2019s trade envoy to Pakistan and Conservative Member of Parliament (MP)\
  \ Rehman Chishti has said that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has agreed to\
  \ give a lecture on UK-Pakistan relations at the British parliament.\nThe Tory MP\
  \ from Gillingham and Rainham told this correspondent after holding talks with the\
  \ former prime minister for an hour on Monday here. Rehman Chishti MP said he met\
  \ Nawaz Sharif to discuss various issues including \u201Clooking at strengthening\
  \ the UK-Pakistan relations, covering trade, security and supporting democratic\
  \ institutions\u201D. He said Britain strongly supported the democratic journey\
  \ of Pakistan and has been providing support too.\nThe MP said he invited the former\
  \ PM to give a lecture in Parliament on UK-Pakistan relations which he has accepted.\
  \ Chishti, however, said that a date for the lecture will be fixed later. A source\
  \ close to Nawaz Sharif said the meeting\_ was held to discuss matters of mutual\
  \ interest in the light of Rehman Chishti\u2019s forthcoming visit to Pakistan.\
  \ He said Rehman Chishti showed his keen interest in developing better trade relations\
  \ between the two countries for which Sharif offered his full support.\nRehman Chishti\
  \ MP was appointed as Adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May last month for promotion\
  \ of trade relations between the UK and Pakistan. Greg Hands, Conservative MP for\
  \ Chelsea & Fulham and Minister of State for International Trade and London in Her\
  \ Majesty's Government, said in a statement that Rehman Chishti has been made UK\
  \ government\u2019s trade envoy because of his \u201Cimmense knowledge of Pakistan\u201D\
  .\nRehman Chishti, who traces his roots to Muzaffarabad in Azad Kashmir where he\
  \ was born, enjoys close relations with children of Benazir Bhutto. He served as\
  \ adviser to former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and worked closely with her on\
  \ several issues while she was in exile."

  \ told no efforts made since November 2016 when\_around 40 workers had died in oil\
  \ tanker explosion\nDespite the loss of almost 40 lives of workers at the Gadani\
  \ ship-breaking yard since November 2016, no efforts have been made by the state\
  \ or the owners to improve the conditions.\nThis was stated by Nasser Mansoor, general\
  \ secretary of the Pakistan National Trades Unions Federation (PNTUF), while addressing\
  \ a seminar at the Irtiqa Institute of Social Sciences on Saturday evening.\nDepartments\
  \ like the police and the environment took bribes from the owners to do their bidding\

  \ on having the genuine union of the workers\nDe-registered. \u201CNow we have a\
  \ union but our collective bargaining is not recognised.\u201D\_\nMansoor said there\
  \ was total blockage of news of accidents that occurred and things were just hushed\
  \ up.\n\u201CThere\u2019s no proper sanitary system for the workers, no proper messing.\
  \ A plate of Daal which may be selling for Rs60 in town sells for Rs90 at Gadani.\
  \ A Roti which sells for Rs5 in town is likely to cost Rs10 there.\nFactories are\
  \ serving as slaughter houses.\u201D\nIndustrialists and politician industrialists\
  \ were not playing the government-mandated minimum wage of Rs14,000 a month to their\
  \ workers, despite the fact that these politicians were constantly shedding crocodile\u2019\
  s tears for the workers.\nHe said that at the time of the recent accidents, no government\
  \ functionary or politician came to enquire after the welfare of the workers. The\
  \ only person who came with 60 vehicles and generous aid was the late Abdul Sattar\
  \ Edhi\u2019s son, Faisal Edhi.\nThe way ship-breaking was being carried out, without\
  \ any set code, harmful substances were being dumped into the sea polluting marine\
  \ life, which was such an important source of food and protein, he said.\n\u201C\
  It is the people who have to get together against this order and change the narrative,\u201D\
  \ he said.\nMansoor said all the oppressed and the working classes would have to\
  \ unite to change the unjust order. He said that there was a deliberate attempt\
  \ to shut Pakistan Steel to pander to the interests of the steel importers and a\
  \ section of the bureaucracy. \u201CIf the state and the capitalists don\u2019t\
  \ go by what they have written, sooner or later there\u2019s sure to be a mighty\
  \ conflagration.\u201D\nMansoor\u2019s talk was preceded by the screening of a movie\
  \ which showed four case studies of the state of workers after some of those countries\
  \ went capitalist and workers were taken for a ride. The four case studies were\
  \ those of Ukraine, Indonesia, Gadani Ship-breaking Works and China.\_\nThe movie\
  \ showed the conditions of the mine workers in Ukraine after independence and the\
  \ end of the socialist era and China after the country went avowedly capitalist.\
  \ The condition of Chinese workers is depicted as horrible under capitalism."

text: "Five public sector universities in KP functioning without VCs\n\nPESHAWAR:\_\
  \ At least five public sector universities in the province are currently functioning\
  \ without a vice-chancellor.\nThis is causing administrative problems in the universities.\
  \ Besides, this shows the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI)-led coalition government\u2019\
  s lack of seriousness about higher education.The failure to make timely appointment\
  \ of regular vice-chancellors and pro-vice-chancellors in the universities is also\
  \ a violation of the Universities Act, which saw multiple amendments by the current\
  \ government.\nPresently, the University of Peshawar, Bacha Khan University Charsadda,\
  \ University of Swabi and Malakand University are without a vice-chancellor.The\
  \ office at the University of Peshawar fell vacant on January 24 with the retirement\
  \ of Prof Dr Rasul Jan. The remaining three universities are without a vice-chancellor\
  \ since January 16.\nThe vice-chancellors of the University of Haripur, Khushal\
  \ Khan University Karak and Bannu University of Science and Technology also completed\
  \ their term on January 16. As pro-vice-chancellors had already been appointed there,\
  \ they took over as acting heads of those universities.\nThe provincial government\
  \ in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Act (Amended) 2016 specially created the post of pro-vice\
  \ chancellors in the public sector universities and made the government bound to\
  \ initiate the process of appointing a full time vice-chancellor six months prior\
  \ to the completion of the tenure of the incumbent so that the practice of ad hocism\
  \ could be ended.\nBut the authorities concerned on the one hand failed to appoint\
  \ pro-vice-chancellors in all the universities and also delayed the process of appointment\
  \ of new vice-chancellors. This is the reason that several universities are now\
  \ without a regular vice-chancellor or even an acting one, which is a violation\
  \ of the law passed by the current government.\nAccording to Khalid Khan, Additional\
  \ Secretary Higher Education Department, summaries for appointment of pro-vice-chancellors\
  \ have already been moved and a final decision was expected.\nHowever, he was unable\
  \ to give proper justification for the inordinate delay in the process.According\
  \ to sources, the summaries for appointment of pro-vice-chancellors at the University\
  \ of Engineering and Technology (UET) Peshawar and University of Peshawar were moved\
  \ nine months back but the appointment couldn\u2019t be made due to \u201Cpolitical\
  \ pressure\u201D.\nThis is the reason that the UET Peshawar has been functioning\
  \ under an acting vice-chancellor for more than one year.Additional Secretary Khalid\
  \ Khan said they were facing problems in appointing a pro-vice chancellor in the\
  \ University of Swabi and Bacha Khan University Charsadda due to the non-availability\
  \ of senior faculty members.\nHe said the case of the University of Malakand was\
  \ different, where the KP Universities\u2019 Act can\u2019t be extended and they\
  \ had moved a summary for appointment of an acting vice-chancellor.Owing to the\
  \ non-availability of the vice-chancellors the universities are facing administrative\
  \ and academic issues.\nAt some universities even mismanagement was reported.At\
  \ the Bacha Khan University, the first anniversary of the terrorist attack was observed\
  \ recently, but due to the non-appointment of the vice-chancellor there was chaos\
  \ and slogan-chanting.\nNone of the dignitaries at the federal and provincial level\
  \ could visit the Bacha Khan University to extend sympathies to the bereaved families,\
  \ the students and the faculty members of the institution.\nAt the University of\
  \ Swabi, the former vice-chancellor left the charge with the treasurer of the university,\
  \ who cannot act as head of the seat of higher studies by any justification. At\
  \ the University of Peshawar too the vice-chancellor left the charge to registrar\
  \ and the administrative officers at the registrar\u2019s office were worried about\
  \ signing the \u2018urgent degrees\u2019 let alone other functions.\n\u201CWhat\
  \ shall we do with the urgent degrees, which can be issued only after the signature\
  \ of the vice-chancellor. This is a serious issue. People do apply for urgent degree\
  \ owing to pressing need,\u201D said an officer.\nAt Malakand University, where\
  \ all the powers are vice-chancellor-centric, the situation is severe. This is the\
  \ university which has not got any full time registrar and treasurer and the vice-chancellor\
  \ has been all-in-all. Now, as there is no vice-chancellor even minor decision pertaining\
  \ to administration or academics cannot be taken.\nThe students of this university\
  \ were scheduled to leave for a study tour on January 24, but they couldn\u2019\
  t do so due to the non-availability of the vice-chancellor. The current administration\
  \ can\u2019t decide even to buy fuel for power generators and owing to unscheduled\
  \ power loadshedding severe problems are faced.\nThe signing of degrees and taking\
  \ other academic and administrative issues are far bigger.Some senior professors\
  \ in an informal chat at the University of Peshawar were heard saying that the delay\
  \ in appointment of pro- and acting and regular vice-chancellors for public sector\
  \ universities were enough to show the interest of the provincial education department\
  \ in higher education. Some others were of the opinion that same was the situation\
  \ at every department in the province.\n\_\n\_"
