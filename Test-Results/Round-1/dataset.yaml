text: ' For the last many years, it s the same basic question: why militant Islamic
  organistions are finding it easy to influence even educated civilian and military
  people? Every time we discussed this issue, the government pledges that it is going
  to develop an anti-extremism narrative and check the sources from where they get
  the inspiration to join the extremist parties and militant Islamic groups. But no
  strategy to check militant Islamism is developed. First we should just look at some
  main factors which make Pakistan an easy hunting ground for the militant predators.
  Right from school, we are indoctrinated with a conservative Islamic ideology and
  history where each Muslim invader is glorified and a narcissist interpretation of
  history is drilled in our mind. Critical thinking is discouraged in our schools
  which is a pre-requisite for any enlightened society. Saleem Ali in his seminal
  book on  Islam and Education  has underlined  It is important, however, to remember
  the distinction between formal education and regimented education. The ability to
  have critical thinking skills is central to a constructive formal education.  The
  Madrassahs  curriculum is even more outdated and exclusive according to the sect
  it belongs to. Jihadis, who lay down their lives in operations in Afghanistan, India
  and Pakistan, are projected as heroes and romanticised. The Army forces have managed
  to motivate their rank and file to fight against Islamist militants despite the
  fact that our soliders are taught a narrative that they are defenders of a country
  which is a fortress of Islam. But this has not happened without exceptions where
  some insiders were involved in terrorist activities A good number of mosques are
  also used to propagate that the entire world is conspiring against Islam. Conspiracy
  theories are easy to sell in weak nations as there is a tendency to pass on the
  blame and discourage introspection. Such theories are amplified with messages in
  support of waging Islamic Jihad by the Urdu media. TV channels and newspapers are
  intimidated by these militant groups to give them positive coverage. The jihadi
  have over 50 publications which attract the youth to the various shades of Islamic  Khilafat  and
  Al Qaeda doctrine. In the past, the middle class youth who wanted to change the
  exploitative system, were attracted by the socialist ideology. But after the set
  back of the Soviet model, they are more attracted by the Islamist extremist ideology.
  By temperament, the youth wants revolutionary changes in the existing system of
  governance. This cannot be delivered by the evolutionary democratic capitalist system.
  Thus, the Islamic militant organisations attract the youth who are already mentally
  prepared at the school level that the country was made to be an Islamic state. Though
  there is no model of a purely Islamic state in the world at present, it has the
  appeal for an average mosque going Muslim. The tactics adopted by the Islamic militant
  groups are also not that of revolutionary groups but at best can be defined as anarchism.
  The recruiters of the extremist militant organisations watched closely such students
  and young men who visit mosques regularly and then indulge them in the discussions
  on the need for establishing a true Islamic state. And those who are more enthusiastic
  are recruited for the terrorist activities. We continue to dangerously mix religion
  with politics and our security policy. The Pakistani establishment also started
  using Jihadi organisations to destablise India and Afghanistan. A major mistake
  because it was bound to boomerang sooner than later. It is bound to influence the
  handlers of the Jihadi organisations first, because they are in touch with them.
  It is no wonder that Islamism has penetrated the forces. The professionalism of
  the Pakistan Armed Forces should be given credit that despite the fact that our
  officers and jawans are trained with the narrative that they are defenders of a
  country which is a fortress of Islam, the army officers have managed to motivate
  their rank and file fighting against the Islamist militants. But not without a few
  exceptions as some insiders were involved in terrorist activities.  So what is to
  be done? The security establishment should shun the Jihadi ideology and support
  to such groups; closely monitor that in the name of preaching Islam no hate mongering
  is indoctrinated to its rank and file; and purge the supporters of these organisations.
  The politicians should take the ideological challenge and develop a communication
  strategy scientifically to convince people that the terrorists have declared war
  against Pakistanis using religion and that we have to stand united for building
  a modern democratic secular Pakistan. It is not war against terrorism; it is defending
  Pakistanis from terrorism. Nothing short of that will work now. There are many blind
  spots and the largest is that we cannot see that our security forces need spring
  cleaning. The security forces should realise that their slogan  Jihad fe sabil Allah  (Jihad
  in the name of God) is the slogan of the Jihadi organisations as well. The good
  development is that for the first time the Army Chief has declared in his speech
  that only the state can declare Jihad. By implication can we presume that the non-state
  actors who are fighting their own Jihad in Afghanistan and India would not be supported
  by the establishment anymore? With the rise in Islamic extremism in the country,
  organised propaganda is promoting grand Islamic Jihad by various Al Qaeda and Islamic
  State franchisees. The intrusion of the ideology of Jihad and establishing  Islamic
  Emirates of Pakistan  or an  Islamic Khilafat  in Pakistan cannot be stopped by
  any operational security measures. The model for this Islamic  Emirates  or a  Khilafat  is
  that of Taliban s rule in Afghanistan and more recently the brutal IS. What is not
  recognised at the civil-military policy making level is that while the military
  is selectively fighting the terrorist organisations and thousands of our security
  personnel have been martyred, they have not challenged the ideology of Jihad. Thousands
  of mosques, madaris and religious organisations are preaching Jihad against the
  West and its allied governments in the Muslim countries. Aren t we blind to this
  glaring fact?   The writer is author of  What s Wrong With Pakistan?  and can be

text: ' Ever since the Pakistani media was liberalised in 2002, channels upon channels
  focusing on news have been launched over the years. For the average Pakistani household,
  evening talk shows have become a major source of political awareness and, if looking
  from a certain angle, even entertainment. Talk shows are not entirely meant to be
  a source of entertainment but the fact remains that they represent dramatisation
  and even comedy on certain occasions. Non-issues are discussed like there is nothing
  else left to be pondered upon while real issues remain on the backburner. Futile
  arguments on live shows divert the audience from the topic and some anchorpersons
  do not prevent the debates from escalating just for the sake of television rating
  points (TRPs); something that is solely meant for raising the commercial viability
  of the show. Although the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulation Authority (PEMRA)
  has been in place for the past 15 years, no considerable steps have been taken to
  contain the  commercial spiciness  in talk shows even after the induction of time-delay
  mechanism for prime time shows. Perhaps, the failure lies largely with the show
  host s abilities to conduct a meaningful program and to some extent the politicisation
  of state institutions like PEMRA. This has been the case with other countries such
  as India as well, where the situation is even worse given how ideological and political
  lines are drawn with impunity. Pakistan needs to revolutionise the way content is
  developed for the average viewer. We do not need to copy the way other countries
  present news or air drama serials Talk shows are meant to spread tolerance and awareness
  on socio-economic and geopolitical matters pertaining to not only the state but
  the world at large. I still remember while I was growing up back in the 1990s when
  there used to be only PTV.  The content of the programs and news reading techniques
  were of a quality we yearn to witness in today s era. Major news channels such as
  Geo News and ARY News rely on sensationalism and even biased reporting void of any
  media ethics to air content. Adding to that, the advent of social media has given
  rise to a new generation which relies on both online and  idiot box  reporting techniques,
  and vents its frustrations on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. This is for
  some of my journalist friends as well who fail to differentiate between what is
  morally right or wrong. Primary examples include the highly sensationalised and
  unethical reporting on certain incidents such as the Ahmadpur-East oil tanker tragedy
  and the APS School Attack. Where did it all go wrong? Perhaps, the answer to this
  question lies in society s own odd preference for  spiciness . This goes for the
  drama industry as well where only a few drama serials such as Humsafar have managed
  to live up to the expectations of the PTV days at a time when senseless Indian dramas
  are watched in greater numbers. Pakistan needs to revolutionise the way content
  is developed for the average viewer. We do not need to copy the way other countries
  present news or air drama serials. Our film industry is already back on track with
  blockbusters like Ho Mann Jahaan and Actor in Law but a lot still needs to be done
  for electronic media. It doesn t mean that the media is full of sensationalism since
  there are some good talk shows aired as well on some of the leading news channels.
  However, the road to identifying media s true potential is a long and bumpy one.   The

text: 'Rescuers Sunday ended their search of a Taiwan building partially toppled by
  a 6.4-magnitude earthquake as the last trapped pair were presumed dead, bringing
  the final death toll to 17. Thousands of emergency workers had combed through rubble
  at the foot of the 12-storey Yun Tsui apartment block since the quake struck the
  eastern city of Hualien late Tuesday. It was left leaning at around a 50-degree
  angle by the quake, complicating rescue efforts due to fears of an imminent collapse.
  Hualien mayor Fu Kun-chi said the last two victims were pinned under heavy pillars
  that could not be removed without risking a total collapse of the building, and
  the rescue was called off with the consent of their relatives. Excavators began
  digging through the building from the top later Sunday to try to recover the bodies,
  he added  Seventeen people were unfortunately killed in the earthquake   I believe
  their relatives will receive proper assistance,  Premier William Lai said while
  paying his respects to victims in Hualien Sunday. The last pair are believed to
  be members of a family from Beijing who arrived in Taiwan on Monday, authorities
  said. The bodies of three other members of the family including a boy aged 12 were
  recovered Saturday. They were staying in a second-floor room at a hotel in the Yun
  Tsui building when the quake struck.  Fourteen of the 17 people who were killed
  perished in the building. Three partially collapsed buildings in Hualien are being
  demolished, including the local landmark Marshal Hotel where one employee was killed.
  Hualien, on Taiwan s picturesque east coast, is one of the most popular tourist
  destinations in the quake-probe island. Taiwan s worst tremor in recent decades
  was a 7.6-magnitude quake in September 1999 that killed around 2,400 people. That
  quake ushered in stricter building codes but many of Taiwan s older buildings remain
  perilously vulnerable to even moderate tremors. Published in Daily Times, February

  Thursday night to honour Batman actor Adam West, who played the superhero role in
  the 1960s television series.  He died on Friday at age 88 following a battle with
  leukemia. The caped crusader helped protect the fictional Gotham City in a franchise
  that began as a DC Comics strip before also moving to television and film. When
  Gotham s authorities needed Batman s help, they projected a light beam with his
  logo into the sky. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and police chief Charlie Beck
  led Thursday s tribute. Hundreds of fans thronged the ceremony, many dressed up
  in costumes from the television series and films. Two replicas of the 1960s-era
  Batmobile were parked outside the building. Burt Ward, 71, who played Batman s sidekick
  Robin on the show, also took part.  I m here to tell you that my friend Adam would
  want every single one of you to be incredibly happy and to be joyous,  he told the
  crowd. The 1966-68 TV series had a low-brow comedy touch that made it far different
  from the darker  Batman  moves of today. West delivered his often corny lines with
  deadpan earnestness, entertaining children and adding a touch of satirical humor
  for adults. The series epitomized the era s kitsch, with exclamations like  POW!  and  BAM!  written
  in pop-art script flashing across television screens. The show gave rise to a movie
  version in 1966, in which West also starred, and fueled a franchise that included
  merchandise like toy Batmobiles, Batphones, dolls and lunchboxes.         '

  Wall at the weekend, featuring photos of soldiers patrolling the former deadly border,
  and stories of those persecuted behind it.  Beyond the Wall    229-metres (250 yards)
  long and facing the West   is designed to keep alive the memory of the dividing
  wall put up by Communist East German authorities nearly 56 years ago on Aug. 13,
  1961. It fell in November 1989 due to mass popular pressure and the decline of Soviet
  Union power. The new exhibition features stills from videos that German-American
  artist Stefan Roloff shot of the Berlin Wall from the west in 1984   including East
  German soldiers peering through binoculars, climbing ladders up to watchtowers and
  walking along the Wall.  There are very few authentic places where you can still
  see what s left of the Wall,  Klaus Lederer, a Berlin senator responsible for culture
  told a news conference. The exhibition also features stories and silhouettes of
  people whose lives were affected by the Wall   including a man who authorities accused
  of having a fetish, a woman arrested for receiving a postcard from a friend in West
  Berlin, and another woman who whose apartment was bugged by the East German Stasi
  secret police. Mario Roellig is one of the victims whose story is told. The Stasi
  interrogated and imprisoned him after he tried to flee to the West to be with his
  boyfriend. He remembers a Stasi officer telling him they would find him anywhere.
  Years later, when Roellig was working in a shop in reunified Berlin, he realized
  a customer inquiring about cigars was his Stasi interrogator. Roellig asked for
  an apology but the man screamed that his sentence was rightful.   It s important
  to talk about it so I can get rid of the fear of this place, that time and above
  all the perpetrators who are still around,  he told Reuters at the Wall. Roellig   who
  now lives in western Berlin   said memories of the past bubble up when he crosses
  a border and he feels unable to ever spend a night at his parents  home in eastern
  Berlin.  To this day I can t stay there overnight as I seem to still be anxious
  that the Wall will be put back up and I ll be on the wrong side again,  he said.
  Roloff, the artist, meanwhile believes his exhibition is particularly relevant at
  a time when U.S. President Donald Trump wants to build a wall along the border with
  Mexico.  For me it s not necessarily a historic project even though it shows things
  from a time that has passed. It s a continuing phenomenon. There have been walls
  as long as people have existed and unfortunately they ll continue to exist,  he
  said.      Published in Daily Times, August 11th 2017.        '

text: ' The recent visit to Vietnam of the US President Barack Obama was epochal both
  for its imagery and substance. One just has to hark back to 1975 to the hurried
  evacuation of the US embassy personnel, when the North Vietnamese forces marched
  victoriously into Saigon, later renamed Ho Chi Minh City. It was a humiliating sight
  for a superpower to be pushed out by a guerrilla enemy after nearly 15 years of
  constant bombardment and military operations where Vietnam s countryside was ravaged
  by the use of chemical Agent Orange, with anywhere between one-two million Vietnamese
  killed and many wounded and maimed, and their offspring born deformed to this day.
  In the midst of it all, Vietnam not only survived but its communist regime prevailed,
  and the country is now as normal as might be expected in the circumstances. And
  now look at the rapturous welcome that greeted President Obama on his visit as if
  all was forgotten. Not only that there is now a fervent desire on both sides to
  forge a new relationship, bordering on a military alliance. During his visit, Obama
  announced the lifting of US arms embargo on Vietnam. During his three-day visit,
  unusual as it is considering their recent history, Obama announced,  The United
  States is fully lifting the ban on military equipment to Vietnam that has been in
  place for 50 years.  What lies behind this transformation in US-Vietnam relationship
  from their once implacable enmity to an emerging strategic alliance? It has to be
  understood against a backdrop of China s projection of power into Asia-Pacific region
  to the point that it is asserting sovereignty over a cluster of islands and islets
  in the South China Sea, also claimed by Vietnam and some other regional countries.
  China has also created a string of artificial islands in its claimed area and built
  up military structures and facilities, thus turning much of the South China Sea
  into its exclusive waters that contain precious oil and gas reserves as well as
  fisheries. The resultant control of the South China Sea will enable China, if it
  so wanted, to control the passage of nearly five trillion dollars worth of trade
  that flows through it as well as movement of all sorts of ships that pass through
  these waters. With China s emergence as a superpower and all the economic and military
  leverage that flows from it, the regional claimants to South China Sea Islands have
  very little countervailing power to China s sovereignty claims sourced from old
  history. However, with the US turning its  pivot  or  re-balancing  act to Asia-Pacific
  region to forge a coalition of regional countries, Beijing s task of completing
  its historical mission is not going to be all that easy. It will face tough opposition.
  Not surprisingly, China is not happy with the US seeking to  stir up  trouble in
  the region. Writing in Singapore s Straits Times newspaper, Xu Bu, China s ambassador
  to 10-member Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) reportedly said,  It
  is no coincidence that the changes in US policy [to rebalance China] have been followed
  by some South-east Asian countries making changes to their policies on the South
  China Sea issue.  And he added,  The tension in South China Sea was intentionally
  churned and hyped [by the US].  Commenting on Obama s Vietnam visit, China s official
  Xinhua news agency said:  It is welcome that Vietnam improves its ties with any
  other country, including the United States. However, such rapprochement should not
  be used by the United States to damage the strategic interests of a third country
  [China].  In other words, China sees its sovereignty as legally and historically
  valid and believes that, but for the US  meddling , the regional countries will
  have no choice but to come to terms with the new situation. At a recent international
  security forum in Singapore, Admiral Sun Jianguo said forcefully   responding to
  the US Defence Secretary Ash Carter s remarks that China risked erecting a  Great
  Wall of self-isolation   that  We [China] do not make trouble, but we have no fear
  of trouble.  He added,  China will not bear the consequences, nor will it allow
  any infringement on its sovereignty and security interest, or stay indifferent to
  some countries creating chaos in the South China Sea.   China sees the US as an
  external power and would rather like it to remain out of Asia-Pacific region strategically.
  But the US doesn t see it this way. It regards itself as much a regional power as
  China with its large Pacific coast, and vital economic and strategic interests by
  virtue of its alliances and old and new friendships, as with Vietnam. It is sending
  aerial and naval patrols to assert  freedom of navigation  in the vicinity of Beijing-claimed
  islands/islets, one of which almost led to a Chinese intercept, at least that is
  how the US saw it. All these activities, with China projecting its power by setting
  up military structures, and the US and its regional allies, like the Philippines,
  challenging it, is turning the region into a veritable tinder box. The Philippines
  has taken the sovereignty issue to a UN court in Hague for arbitration, with China
  refusing to submit to its jurisdiction. If the court s decision goes in the favour
  of the Philippines, as is generally expected, it is going to further complicate
  the situation. Lately, the sovereignty issue regarding another group of islands
  is also starting to feature in China s relations, this time with Indonesia. Against
  such backdrop of rising regional tensions, Obama s Vietnam visit and lifting of
  ban on the US arms sales to that country is indicative of how serious the situation
  is getting in the Asia Pacific region. President Obama s Vietnam visit was followed
  up by his trip to Japan, another country with contested sovereignty with China over
  a group of islands in East China Sea. In East China Sea, the two countries have
  almost come to blows a few times. The US is Japan s security partner in the region.
  Their alliance has got even stronger against the backdrop of China s power projection
  in the region. Tokyo has relaxed some of the pacifist features of its post-WWII
  constitution with a view to meet new security challenges from China. Apart from

  a popular topic of discussion as #GTRoadRally was among the top 10 trends on Twitter.
  Former PM s daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif tweeted,?  Just spoke to my father. He
  said he has never in his political life witnessed anything like that. The passion
  and fervour simply unbelievable . Other PML-N lawmakers who live tweeted the rally
  were Railways Minister Saad Rafique, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal, State Ministers
  Marvi Memon and Talal Chaudhry. Dismissing concerns expressed by those opposing
  Sharif s decision to proceed with the rally, she tweeted that Sharif had been voted
  into power by the people and could be sent home only by the people. Activist Jasmine
  Afridi? noted that there were only two political parties in Pakistan, PML-N and
  the establishment.  Rest are pressure groups and mercenaries. #HumSherHain #GtroadRally,  she
  tweeted. Journalist Farrukh K. Pitafi? was impressed with the crowd size.  This

  \ on Monday to clear the way for landmark talks to go ahead, after marathon negotiations\
  \ overcame Austrian objections.EU foreign ministers secured the deal for membership\

  \ bloc, already reeling from a double blow over its future shape earlier this year.British\
  \ Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, speaking after more than 24 hours of talks, called\
  \ a new meeting of ministers Monday evening to formally approve the terms for the\
  \ talks, minutes after Ankara gave its approval.\u201CAgreement has been reached\
  \ and, God willing, we are heading for Luxembourg,\u201D Turkish Foreign Minister\
  \ Abdullah Gul told reporters in Ankara, where his jet had been standing ready awaiting\
  \ an accord.The breakthrough came after Straw warned that failure would prove \u201C\
  catastrophic\u201D for the bloc, still in turmoil following French and Dutch rejections\
  \ of its first-ever constitution in May and June.It also came as UN war crimes prosecutor\
  \ Carla del Ponte said Croatia was fully cooperating with her, a key demand for\
  \ Zagreb to start EU talks. There is widespread speculation that Croatia\u2019s\
  \ and Turkey\u2019s EU bids are linked.The talks have been blocked by Austrian demands\
  \ that the EU offer Turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called\
  \ \u201Cnegotiating framework\u201D for the talks, which sets out their principles\
  \ and logistics.Vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the EU\u2019\
  s \u201Cabsorption capacity\u201D should be taken into account when assessing if\
  \ Turkey can join, diplomats say.The EU was forced to postpone a planned ceremony\
  \ Monday afternoon to formally open the talks with Turkey, whose Foreign Minister\
  \ Abdullah Gul remained in Ankara pending confirmation of an accord.It was assumed\
  \ that the signing ceremony would take place later Monday in Luxembourg.After four\
  \ decades of knocking at Europe\u2019s door, EU leaders meeting in December gave\
  \ the vast predominantly Muslim country a date of October 3 to start membership\
  \ talks.But Ankara\u2019s recent insistence that it would still not recognise EU\

  \ created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date.It remained unclear\
  \ late Monday what exact wording was finally agreed for the negotiating framework.The\
  \ latest draft \u2014 accepted by all 24 other EU states \u2014 says EU entry is\
  \ the main aim of the talks. Austria wanted that tempered with another formula,\
  \ if not replaced altogether.The EU delay has angered Turkish politicians and the\
  \ public alike.Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country has suffered through\
  \ tough political, economic and social reform to join, had urged the EU to show\
  \ good sense before the accord was struck.\u201CIf the EU wants to become a global\
  \ power, if it aims to eliminate the conflict of civilizations, the concert of civilizations\
  \ must be achieved,\u201D he said.The EU has long underlined that the fact of starting\
  \ membership negotiations does not guarantee that Turkey will actually join.In any\
  \ case the talks are likely to take at least a decade, during which Turkey will\
  \ have to bring comply with a succession of \u201Cchapters,\u201D or EU policy areas,\

- 'Supermarket shelf gamble behind UK minimum wage  '
- ' Newspaper '
- ' DAWN.COM'
text: "BRITISH politicians do not make a habit of saying nice things about the French\
  \ economy. So when Nick Boles, a UK government minister, said he wanted British\
  \ businesses to be a bit more French \u2014 at least in one respect \u2014 the audience\
  \ sat up. The object of his admiration? The little electronic price labels on the\
  \ shelves of French supermarkets. Thanks to this labelling system, one person can\
  \ change all the prices in a French supermarket with a few clicks. Some systems\
  \ can handle up to 90,000 price updates an hour. In British supermarkets, prices\
  \ are usually printed on paper and distributed by workers traipsing up and down\
  \ the aisles when they need to be changed.For Mr Boles, this is poor productivity,\
  \ the \u2018entrenched British disease\u2019, writ small. The average French worker\
  \ generates 15pc more economic output than the average UK worker even though they\
  \ spend less time at work. On a per-hour basis, the gap is 31pc. And the gap between\
  \ the UK and most of its G7 peers is widening. One mooted explanation for the UK\u2019\
  s poor productivity, particularly since the financial crisis, is that labour has\
  \ been so cheap that companies do not feel the need to innovate or investBritain\u2019\
  s Conservative government has a radical plan to tackle this \u2014 turning conventional\
  \ economics on its head. An economist would say that higher productivity is the\
  \ prerequisite for higher wages. Extra pay can only be justified when people are\
  \ producing more or better stuff or services. But ministers are betting on the opposite.\
  \ From April 1, they will push up the UK minimum wage sharply for people aged 25\
  \ and over, in the belief that this will force companies to boost productivity to\
  \ justify the higher pay. \u201CRequiring a pay increase can prompt employers to\
  \ make the investments that they otherwise do not necessarily feel they need to\
  \ make,\u201D Mr Boles said in a recent speech. Those French digital price labels\
  \ are exactly the sort of investment he means. It might work. One mooted explanation\
  \ for the UK\u2019s poor productivity, particularly since the financial crisis,\
  \ is that labour has been so cheap that companies do not feel the need to innovate\
  \ or invest. Why buy a car wash when you can hire 10 people with sponges? And why\
  \ train those workers when you can hire extra pairs of hands at little cost? It\
  \ is also possible that higher pay will boost productivity on its own, by making\
  \ employees less likely to quit. But for the policy to work as the government hopes,\
  \ you have to make some punchy assumptions. Analysis by the Resolution Foundation,\
  \ a think-tank, shows that productivity would have to rise 6pc a year until 2020\
  \ to maintain its historic relationship with the minimum wage. Productivity typically\
  \ rose about 2pc a year before the financial crisis and less than 1pc a year in\
  \ its aftermath. The big question is whether companies most affected by the higher\
  \ minimum wage \u2014 typically, small ones with thin margins in sectors such as\
  \ hospitality and retail \u2014 can achieve this transformation. I met a woman recently\
  \ who runs three small hotels, two of which already make a loss. Her wage bill,\
  \ by far her biggest cost, is about to increase sharply because of the minimum wage.\
  \ It is not clear where she would find the money to invest in training or technology\
  \ even if she knew what to spend it on. Indeed, many small businesses are worried\
  \ that it will be harder to upskill their workers when the wage floor rises, because\
  \ it will compress their pay structures. If entry-level workers are on a similar\
  \ salary to team leaders or supervisors, where is the incentive to take on the extra\
  \ training and responsibility? If businesses struggle to boost productivity by as\
  \ much as ministers hope, they will have to cope in other ways, such as increasing\
  \ prices or accepting lower profit margins. Neither would be a disaster. The biggest\
  \ risk, particularly if the UK economy continues to slow, is if companies shed staff\
  \ or stop hiring. That might boost overall productivity, but only because the least\
  \ productive people are not in the workforce at all. In that sense, France was an\
  \ unfortunate example for Mr Boles to choose. French workers may be more productive,\
  \ but the unemployment rate is 10pc, almost double that in the UK. The crux of the\
  \ government\u2019s great supermarket-shelf gamble is believing it can combine French\
  \ levels of productivity with British levels of employment. That is a long, risky\
  \ road to take. Still, the rest of the world would be crazy not to watch the experiment.\

text: "It is important to correctly judge the nuances of the agreement reached between\
  \ the United States and India during US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter\u2019s visit\
  \ to New Delhi on April 10-12. It was his second visit in less than a year. India\u2019\
  s defence minister and he \u201Cagreed in principle to conclude a Logistics Exchange\
  \ Memorandum of Agreement [Lemoa] in the coming months\u201D.It will be different\
  \ from the standard Logistics Support Agreement which the US signs with its strategic\
  \ partners. It has been pressing India to sign it for a decade. We shall know parliament\u2019\
  s reaction when it meets on Monday. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will be obliged\
  \ to make a full statement and reply to questions.The Lemoa is one of three \u2018\
  foundation agreements\u2019 the US proposes to conclude with India. The other two\
  \ are the Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (Cismoa)\
  \ and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (Beca) for geospatial intelligence.\
  \ In the past, India extended logistics assistance to the US on a case-by-case basis;\
  \ most notably in providing refuelling facilities to American aircraft during the\
  \ Gulf War in 1991.The recent US-India deal is a slippery slope.Under Cismoa, India\
  \ would get encrypted communications equipment and systems allowing military commanders\
  \ to communicate with aircraft and ships through a secure network, while Beca would\
  \ provide it with topographical and aeronautical data and products, which will aid\
  \ navigation and targeting. Under Lemoa, the two sides can access supplies, spare\
  \ parts and services from each other\u2019s land facilities, air bases, and ports,\
  \ which can then be reimbursed.However, India needs no facilities on US bases in\
  \ the Asia-Pacific region. The only ones it can reach are in Diego Garcia in the\
  \ Indian Ocean and Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. The Manmohan Singh government,\
  \ even the BJP government had refused to conclude Lemoa with its pretence of reciprocity.\
  \ In 2003, the US asked India to send its troops to participate in the war on Iraq.\
  \ Leading Indian hawks, including a former high commissioner, fervently supported\
  \ the idea for it would signify projection of India\u2019s power beyond its shores.\
  \ But Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee kept his head and overruled a virtually\
  \ unanimous cabinet.Now the former defence minister A.K. Antony has voiced the opposition.\
  \ \u201CThey can refuel their ships and aircraft etc. and, if necessary, keep their\
  \ military equipment on Indian soil.\u201D India rarely operates beyond its shores.\
  \ \u201CThis agreement practically gives very little advantage to it, but gives\
  \ an enormous opportunity to the US military.\u201D This is especially true at a\
  \ time when the US has announced that in the next three years, 60pc of its Marines\
  \ will be placed in Asia-Pacific region.\u201CIt means gradually India will become\
  \ one of their major facilitators. It is a dangerous game. It will become part of\
  \ military conflicts. It will affect our strategic autonomy. In the eyes of the\
  \ world, India will become part of the US military bloc,\u201D a correspondent reported.In\
  \ January, President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed the Joint\
  \ Strategic Vision Statement, while Ashton Carter and Manohar Parrikar signed the\
  \ Framework for US\u2013India Defence Relationship in 2015. The US is prompted by\
  \ a larger strategic purpose rather than immediate tactical advantages.Immediately\
  \ before arriving in India, Ashton Carter spoke to the Council on Foreign Relations\
  \ in New York on April 8. Recalling President Obama\u2019s policy of a rebalance\
  \ to the Asia-Pacific, he said: \u201CMilitarily, the Depart\xADment of Defence\
  \ is operationalising the next phase of the rebalance, and cementing it for the\
  \ long term. We are enhancing Ame\xADrica\u2019s force posture throughout this vitally\
  \ important region to continue playing a pivotal role from the sea, in the air,\
  \ and under the water, as well as to make our posture more geographically distributed,\
  \ operationally resilient, and politically sustainable.\u201D The proposed \u2018\
  foundation agreements\u2019 are part of this strategy.Speaking last month in Delhi,\
  \ the Indian capital, Admiral Harry Harris, who heads America\u2019s Pacific Command\
  \ (responsible, he said, for American military operations \u201Cfrom Hollywood to\
  \ Bollywood\u201D), described expanded military cooperation with India as \u201C\
  arguably the defining partnership for America in the 21st century\u201D as reported\
  \ by The Economist\u2019s New Delhi correspondent reported some days ago.His comments\
  \ on the trends he sees are ominous. \u201CThere will be no flashy wedding between\
  \ the two in the near future. But what is emerging is a quiet, cautious meeting\
  \ of mutual interests. American officials call it a strategic handshake; Indian\
  \ ones, a strategic partnership. Neither would utter the world \u2018alliance\u2019\
  , but if the relationship continues to thicken, that is what conceivably might take\
  \ shape somewhere down the road.\u201DIndia is not prepared for a military alliance;\
  \ but it has begun to tread on a slippery path, eyeing China\u2019s relation closely.The\

  \ sight of green hills and uneven land. But these days, the media\u2019s focus is\
  \ on the brutal killing of a schoolgirl in the name of honour. 16-year-old Ambreen\
  \ was killed and burnt last week in Makol, Abottabad, on the orders of a local jirga.\
  \ \t\t\t\t\tThe burnt vehicle. \u2014Photo by the author\t\t\t\t\u201CPeople seem\
  \ afraid,\u201D says Ambreen\u2019s distant uncle. The girl\u2019s father, Riasat,\
  \ sits quiet in a corner, his dusty clothes unbuttoned and his face marked with\
  \ creases of worry and grief. His eyes are red, and he says he hasn\u2019t slept\
  \ much since his niece\u2019s murder. \u201CWe laid her body to rest at around 3am,\u201D\
  \ the uncle explains.Local residents have been avoiding Riasat\u2019s residence\u2014\
  \ if they condemn his only daughter\u2019s murder, they have not shown it. \u201C\
  Very few people have visited the house to console him,\u201D another relative adds.\
  \ The family does not want to share much information about her brutal killing. Ambreen\u2019\
  s brother, Noman, offers a few details: on April 28, all family members had gone\
  \ to bed after dinner, as they usually did. The next morning, the girl was not in\
  \ her bed. \u201CWe started searching for Ambreen soon after,\u201D Noman remembers.\
  \ \u201CWe contacted our uncle, other relatives\u2026 but all in vain.\u201D At\
  \ the time, Riasat was near the Karachi-Balochistan border, where he works as a\
  \ labourer. A first cousin called him up with the news that Ambreen was missing.\
  \ \t\t\t\t\tRiasat, Ambreen's father. \u2014Photo by the author\t\t\t\t\t\t\t By\
  \ the time he got to Makol, the police had arrested the members of the jirga and\
  \ their facilitators, including his wife\u2014 but his daughter was gone. \u201C\
  I had talked to Ambreen a few weeks back,\u201D Riasat says. \u201CI had promised\
  \ to send her money in May for her re-admission in tenth grade.\u201D Read next:\
  \ The jirga that murdered Ambreen should be Pakistan's lastPunishing with fireAlthough\
  \ the police have arrested the jirga councilor Pervaiz, Ambreen\u2019s family\u2014\
  including her father\u2014and other local residents avoid talking about him. \u201C\
  I don\u2019t know who killed my daughter but I want exemplary punishment for the\
  \ killers,\" Riasat says.Naseer Ahmad, the Station House Officer of Dona Gali was\
  \ the first policeman to arrive at the crime scene. According to him, it was Pervaiz\
  \ who first called up the police to inform them about the fire. When Naseer arrived\
  \ at the site, he remembers a few locals hanging around, but none were willing to\
  \ pull out the dead body. He recalls how Ambreen\u2019s body\u2014 possibly burnt\
  \ alive\u2014 sat like a statue in the van. \"Her lifeless hands appeared to be\
  \ clenched in a fist,\" he says, explaining that the posture implied signs of resistance.Naseer\
  \ says the police\u2019s initial investigation pieced together some of the story:\
  \ head of the jirga, Pervaiz, had summoned a six-hour long meeting to decide Ambreen\u2019\
  s fate. Her crime, according to the elder, was helping a girl from the Pervaiz family\
  \ escape from her home with a man. The jirga also held another man from the same\
  \ tribe, who is now in police custody. Pervaiz claims the runaway couple had used\
  \ the vehicle for their transport, and with the consensus of the jirga, agreed to\
  \ burn it to down to ash. As far as Ambreen was concerned, Naseer adds, once the\
  \ jirga was dismissed they located her\u2014drugged her\u2014 then presented her\
  \ before their members. Here, she was strangled. \u201CThe killers tried their best\
  \ to destroy the evidence,\u201D the SHO adds. \u201CThey placed her dead body in\
  \ the vehicle, and set it on fire.\u201D Once the smoke dispersed, policemen were\
  \ asked to make an announcement through loudspeakers to help identify the body.Read\
  \ next: A country of dead women\u201CAlmost all villagers came to the spot,\u201D\
  \ Naseer says, \u201CExcept for Ambreen\u2019s mother.\u201D While waiting for the\
  \ dead girl\u2019s family to show up, and searching around the burnt vehicle, police\
  \ found a piece of burnt paper with Noman\u2019s name scribbled upon it. \t\t\t\t\
  \tRiasat and Noman. \u2014Photo by the author\t\t\t\tThis led them to the brother,\
  \ who helped them track the jirga members and alleged facilitators. But Naseer feels\
  \ the mother's role is controversial. \"Even though she was aware of the developments,\"\
  \ he says, \"She did not inform the police in time.\" Widespread panicLocal residents\
  \ and police say that the brutal incident was the first of its kind in the area.\
  \ But even though they rely on the police\u2019s help to solve their disputes, not\
  \ many want to talk about Ambreen\u2019s murder or the jirga. \u201CSince the incident,\
  \ girls\u2019 attendance has dropped to zero,\u201D says Khaliq Zaman, a teacher\
  \ at Government High School Makol Payyan. Khaliq remembers teaching Ambreen too\u2014\
  \u201CShe was a kind and helpful girl\u201D\u2014but her death has left a negative\
  \ impact on other girls and their parents. The arrests have helped in restoring\
  \ much of the tension to normality, but girls\u2019 attendance, for example, is\
  \ hardly satisfactory. \u201CSix girls have pulled out of school, either due to\
  \ fear, or because they were forced by their parents,\u201D Khaliq says.Parents\
  \ in Makol confirm this fear. \u201CI am afraid to send my children to school,\u201D\
  \ says Shah Gul, a resident of Makol. Riasat, however, says fear is no solution.\
  \ \u201CWhat happened to my family and Makol is unbelievable,\u201D he admits, \u201C\
  But in order to avoid such acts in the future, it is the killers who should be burnt\
  \ alive.\u201D \t\t\t\t\tThe burnt vehicle. \u2014Photo by the author\t\t\t\t"

  lamented Big Ben has decided to bid farewell to the party. She, spouse of our former
  ambassador to Uncle Sam, has said in a missive to young Bill that she finds herself
  out of place in the organisation the party has now become. She believes that since
  Big Ben s demise, the core of the party has changed, to the extent that it is now
  unrecognisable. And that for some in the party leadership, staying in power is the
  only thing that matters. Of course, she has also lodged her protest at the shoddy
  treatment meted out to her husband, as well she might, because his only sin is that
  he has fallen out of favour with the powers-that-be. Readers will recall that after
  a succession of foreign policy failures, apologists for these powers have been laying
  Pakistan s growing international isolation at the former diplomat s door. And as
  soon as that happened, Big Ben s Hubby lost no time in distancing himself from the
  ex-ambassador. This because Hubby s buddy s in the slammer for his sins of commission
  and omission, and that young woman who was allegedly his courier, is a permanent
  fixture on the Exit Control List. Both, it is believed, at the behest of the powers-that-be.
  Whatever the outcome, one certainty is that the much-diminished colossus of a political
  party has lost another faithful follower. Brexit ripples The results of Britain
  s recent referendum in which 52 % voters opted out of the European Union while 48
  % chose to remain within, is still causing huge ripples. These range from the sublime

text: ' The international reaction to Mr Nawaz Sharif s disqualification by the Supreme
  Court has been muted. Washington and Beijing were probably the only two capitals
  that shared their positions on the political developments in the country following
  the court verdict, but neither gave any observation on the apex court s decision.
  Both said the issue was Pakistan s internal matter. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz,
  in a statement issued by the Prime Minister s Office after the verdict, railed against
  it, saying that the legal proceedings were unparalleled in the country s 70-year
  history.  Legal and constitutional requirements of fair trial were violated. We
  have suffered injustice,  the party noted even as it announced compliance with the
  verdict. Due process is something very close to the heart of the international community,
  but no government chose to raise the issue. The Chinese government said Mr Nawaz
  Sharif s dismissal was Pakistan s  internal affair . The advice for political parties
  was:  As a friendly neighbour, China hopes that all parties and sections in Pakistan
  can prioritise state and national interests, properly deal with their domestic affairs,
  maintain unity and stability and keep focusing on the economic and social development.  Its
  focus was that relations should remain unaffected and that CPEC should continue
  unimpeded. One reason for their emphasis on CPEC was that Mr Nawaz Sharif s cabinet
  ministers had days before the announcement of the verdict said that Mr Sharif was
  being punished for initiating CPEC. Beijing reminded that,  building the Belt and
  Road and building a community of shared future,   serves fundamental interests of
  the two countries and peoples and promotes peace and development of the region and
  beyond.  Mr Sharif s cabinet members had also tried to drag in the Arab world by
  saying that the PML-N government s  neutrality  on Yemen and Qatar was behind their
  political troubles. This was a direct allegation against one of the Arab countries,
  but mercifully the Arabs chose to remain silent. Washington s response was more
  measured. A State Department spokesman said:  This is an internal matter. We look
  forward to a smooth transition as Pakistan s parliament selects the next prime minister.
  US Ambassador David Hale said in a statement after Khaqan Abbasi s election:  We
  look forward to working with him to advance our shared interests in a secure, democratic,
  peaceful, and prosperous Pakistan and region.  Not much change is expected in foreign
  policy after the change in PM House. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the
  PML-N remains in power and, secondly Mr Nawaz Sharif would be remote controlling
  the government as the party chief. Furthermore, the PML-N government would be pre-occupied
  for the remaining period with domestic issues instead of attending to foreign affairs.
  Therefore, continuity is expected in external relations. Moody s Investors Service,
  the international bond credit rating agency, is, however, fearful about political
  uncertainty following Mr Nawaz Sharif s disqualification. If heightened political
  uncertainty and strife among the various branches of government disrupt the administration
  s economic and fiscal agenda, macroeconomic stability and the government s access
  to external finance could be impaired, weighing on Pakistan s credit profile.  The
  reaction in the international media has been mixed. In its editorial, The Washington
  Post said:  Pakistan undoubtedly faces a period of political uncertainty.   Whatever
  the political outcome, Pakistan seems likely not to be shaken from its desire for
  closer relations with China  Pakistan s military and its intelligence service also
  will remain powerful forces behind the scenes of the Muslim-majority nation, a nuclear
  weapons state. Still, Pakistan has so often been a miasma of uncertainty, impunity,
  coercion and violence that it is worth applauding the Supreme Court s determination
  to see this case to a difficult but necessary conclusion. It s a glimmer of hope
  for accountability and rule of law in a nation that could use much more of it.  In
  an op-ed piece in The New York Times, it has been said:  The judges have clearly
  undermined the perception of justice by deposing Mr. Sharif without due process
  or trial to prove his innocence. Pakistan s next national elections, scheduled for
  2018, could have resulted in a historic second democratic turnover of power through
  elections.  A Bloomberg editorial read:  Nobody should be above the law, but the
  circumstances surrounding the judgment are troubling. The justices have faced pressure
  from rival politician Imran Khan, who has been campaigning to drive Sharif from
  office.  In the Guardian s opinion:  Efforts must not stop there. The public register
  for beneficial owners of UK companies must be extended to British tax havens; it
  must include trusts; and a proper means of checking it must be introduced. Accountability
  should not depend on leaks, however effective they have proved this time.  The writer

text: ' The occult has been a strange but constant companion throughout my life, starting
  from when I learned to read a Celtic-cross tarot spread before I knew how to play
  solitaire. This is mainly because my mother s side of the family was into divination,
  and I took for granted that every Wednesday we would shuffle the cards, cut them
  with the left hand and then hope to God one didn t get the Tower as an outcome to
  one s latest queries. Alas divination comes in many forms and I took all of them
  seriously: palm reading, dream interpretation, astrology, omens, Ouija boards, spellcraft,
  candle magic, the I Ching. If it could be in an episode of Buffy I was all up in
  it. Some small-minded people saw these are transgressions against Islam, but if
  you think about it, the occult is all around us in Pakistan. Like when mothers say
  a little prayer and blow it over their kids to protect them; or pack their children
  off to exams with water from Mecca or the dirt from holy shrines; or when grown
  men sport turquoise and amber rings to ward off the evil eye. Indeed, the collective
  and never-ending escape from the incessant gaze of the evil eye is one of the most
  entrenched occult aspects of our culture (other than sporadic possession by jinns,
  of course). Greenwood Cemetery is filled with crypts and tombs that go back hundreds
  of years It shouldn t come to you as a surprise then that by the time I was 16 I
  was already practicing Wicca. My room was covered in candles and I proudly wore
  a pentagram to school on which I had performed a moonlight enchantment to increase
  my productivity and/or fat-loss. I remember a teacher at school at the time had
  asked me what I was wearing and when I explained to her the details of a moonlight
  enchantment (you don t want to know) she looked at me like I was, well, a witch,
  which I suppose wasn t too far from my ambition but stung nevertheless. ( Churayl!
  ) Despite the fact that I long ago recalibrated my belief systems to something decidedly
  less otherworldly, the occult remains in me. I throw spilt salt over my left shoulder,
  and I begin every day/week/month by reading my horoscope to see how things might
  turn out. Sometimes I even read seven and take an average of the best information
  to make one super-happy horoscope of my own. Because of all this, Halloween is my
  favorite time of year, bar none. I love it more than fog in the winter, more than
  beaches in the summer and more than most food groups except for two kinds of pastries.
  It is the one time that the rest of the world catches up to the mysterious powers
  that obsess me most of the year. The occult is very much a part of life for the
  average Pakistani My Halloweens in Lahore were usually spent at a house party filled
  with the same people you see at other parties, except dressed more absurdly. But
  now I am happy to learn that New York City takes Halloween extremely seriously.
  So seriously, indeed, that I had several friends congregate and stay with me this
  whole Halloween weekend for three nights of revelries and costume changes. Night
  One was a masquerade ball at an abandoned church that is now a sort of club-meets-haunted-house,
  filled with some of the most well-dressed 18th century ghouls and goblins you can
  ever hope to see. Day Two, I made everyone trek down to the nether parts of Brooklyn
  so that we could go to one of my favourite places in the world, Greenwood Cemetery.
  It was designed by the same man who designed central park and other green spaces
  in New York and so you can imagine it as a large, hilly necropolis filled with crypts
  and tombs that go back hundreds of years. There are vast lagoons surrounded by weeping
  willows and it is one of the few places in the city that you can sit in and not
  hear car alarms or traffic. The cemetery comes alive (in a manner of speaking) over
  Halloween, and was decorated lavishly with pumpkins and cobwebs. People were dressed
  up as the many famous residents of the graves, including the artist Basquiat as
  well as Civil War heroes, socialites and actors. It was sublimely creepy. By night
  three I was running low on costume ideas but in a timely and brilliant manner, I
  managed to go as a Snapchat filter to see the parade of crazy costumes that comes
  down 6th Avenue on the actual night of Halloween. The streets were filled with the
  kind of joy that only comes when adults can dress up as Ninja Turtles or Madonna
  without judgment. New Yorker kids don t have houses to go Trick-or-Treating to,
  so many of the parents take them on tours of the delis and restaurants on their
  block that kindly oblige by having baskets of candy available for them. I retired
  early that night, knowing that by midnight the streets would look like the Thriller
  Song except more rambunctious, but I did enjoy every minute of my late-night tarot
  spreads at home. Happy Halloween! Write to thekantawala@gmail.com '

text: " Blowing in the wind  Sir, On the 21st Ramzan I very prayerfully hazarded out\
  \ to visit a relative. My daughter was in front seat and my three, foreign born\
  \ and visiting briefly, little grandchildren were in the back seat. Two were belted\
  \ down: there was no rear third belt. On asking the little one to sit back and still,\
  \ the 4 year old on one side promptly came up with,  In Pakistan there are no seat\
  \ belt laws!  I drove in flummoxed silence at this revelation from little kids used\
  \ to being strapped into specific car seats from the first drive onwards. With thin\
  \ traffic as we drove towards the Metropole, I noted that from Aisha Bawany school\
  \ onwards high encroaching walls and barricades lined much of Shahrah-e-Faisal to\
  \ protect military residences and offices. The Cantonment Station road and the lane\
  \ ahead were closed off by troops to safeguard the military elite s front and back.\
  \ As I turned towards Clifton the Qasre Naz State Guest complex area was similarly\
  \ defended by Sindh protectors. Since the PIDC road leading to the CM s House usually\
  \ remains half closed it was probably safe to assume that our CM would take no chances\
  \ on his own security on such a sensitive and high tension day. These two disparate\
  \ issues reflect what is wrong with Pakistan. I would request our Honourable Supreme\
  \ Court, the military High Command, and our politicians if they can spare the time,\
  \ to ponder the following: Pakistan is fighting a war largely of its own making.\
  \ Leaders, law enforcers and the military are also targeted, but most have the ability\
  \ and obvious freedom to arm, protect and wall themselves into the best of the nation\
  \ s resources. The disintegration of the unprotected civic society: denied constitutional\
  \ rights, looted, extorted, terrorized, even butchered, and now internally displaced\
  \ by the hundreds of thousands, continues unabated. As collateral damage, and with\
  \ only their Maker to turn to, is it surprising that we are an anarchic country\
  \ with everyone for himself as the Law of the Jungle rules? Even with attempts at\
  \ civilized home upbringing, children grow watching their parents, peers and those\
  \ around them being part of the all-pervading hypocrisy of our apathetic, corrupt\
  \ and bigoted environment. It is these same children who will become the teachers,\
  \ doctors, businessmen, mullahs, politicians, lawyers, judges and generals of tomorrow.\
  \ In the absence of law and order will they be concerned about the niceties of civic\
  \ sense and good governance when adult? What values will they uphold and can these\
  \ conform to what is expected from constitutional civic society? The answer is blowing\
  \ in the wind! Dr Mervyn Hosein, Karachi. Unsung heroes  Sir, August the 2nd, the\
  \ Foundation Day of Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), came and went\
  \ without even a single commemorative event, or even a press statement. It was on\
  \ this day in 1950 that a group of highly professional journalists, many of whom\
  \ later become the editors of leading newspapers, lay the foundation of the professional\
  \ trade union, aiming to struggle for the freedom of the press, better working conditions,\
  \ and to raise professional standards. The initial meeting was planned at the Sindh\
  \ Madrassa, but when journalists reached the site, they found out that the gates\
  \ had been locked on the orders of the administration. The meeting was then held\
  \ in a park. A convention was then held at Khaliq Deena Hall, and was inaugurated\
  \ by Sir Zafarullah Khan. A delegation from Delhi Union of Journalists also attended\
  \ the ceremony. The constitution of the PFUJ was finalized after days of deliberations.\
  \ For the last 64 years, the PFUJ has been struggling for the rights of journalists,\
  \ and has lost some great leaders in the process   from MA Shakoor to Israr Ahmad,\
  \ from Nisar Usmani to Minhaj Barna and many unsung heroes as well. The media is\
  \ in golden chains today, and that has divided journalists, editors, and media owners.\
  \ But we should all at least commemorate the sacrifices of our heroes and some of\
  \ the golden chapters in our history. Mazhar Abbas, Karachi. It won t fly  Sir,\
  \ When the PIA submitted a business plan for inducting B777 aircraft a while ago,\
  \ it envisaged growth in revenue, expansion of routes and profitability by 2011.\
  \ Instead, its accumulated losses escalated beyond Rs 200 Billion by end of 2013.\
  \ PIA s fall from an airline of repute to disrepute is a direct consequence of incompetent\
  \ corrupt cronies appointed by successive governments, their unethical practices,\
  \ lack of accountability, and massive pilferage, and not because of commercial factors.\
  \ Public and state owned airlines like Ethiopian and Emirates have grown, and so\
  \ have Etihad and Qatar, because their government appointed the best qualified team\
  \ of professionals to run them, with a competent Board of Governors overseeing the\
  \ executives and showing zero tolerance for revenue pilferage and financial or administrative\
  \ irregularities. The fact that PIA profits, fleet and routes recorded growth under\
  \ Rafique Saigol and AM Nur Khan, only proves that given a good management with\
  \ full powers, it can become an airline serving its clients and making money, instead\
  \ of white elephant it has been reduced to by officials with conflicts of interest\
  \ and a history of financial irregularities. What PIA needs is a CEO with competence,\
  \ integrity and experience of Tewolde GebreMariam of Ethiopian Airlines, Michael\
  \ O Leary of Rayaan Air, Craig Kreeger of Virgin Atlantic, or Tim Clark of Emirates,\
  \ instead of the choice of semi literate cronies, or retired uniformed officers\
  \ appointed by every successive government starting from Musharraf to Asif Zardari\
  \ and now Nawaz Sharif. If PIA continues to post incompetent officials at key stations\
  \ like Manchester, Birmingham, Toronto, and New York, then adding another 15 new\
  \ aircraft on lease would meet the same fate as the induction of the B777 fleet.\
  \ What Pakistan needs are powerful independent regulatory bodies, enforcing financial\
  \ and administrative discipline in both public and private sector enterprises, with\
  \ a comprehensive system of inbuilt accountability and zero tolerance for organized\
  \ corruption. This cannot be achieved unless those involved in malpractices and\
  \ on the payroll of PSM, PIA, and CAA are surgically eliminated with no exception.\
  \ Tariq Ali, Lahore. Good books  Sir, Whenever I ask the young minds of our upcoming\
  \ generation why they need to study literature, I am likely to get a response from\
  \ them in the form of  drawing a blank . I start pestering them to give some sort\
  \ of an opinion over this question and the answers I do receive are generally instilled\
  \ with words such as  pointless ,  useless ,  no good  or even just a shrug that\
  \ simply discards the entire subject altogether. And that s a very hard blow to\
  \ take for someone who is apparently teaching the subject with the idea that it\
  \ is the most crucial stepping stone to broadening the horizons of these young learners.\
  \ As an advocate of the subject, I have observed the growing negligence towards\
  \ Literature amongst my teenaged students. Or to be more precise, there is without\
  \ a doubt a major lack of basic understanding of the subject. They all know why\
  \ they need to study English Language but when it comes to the subject of Literature,\
  \ their minds become foggy. Since, according to me, this is a growing concern, and\
  \ also in order to answer all those who raise the question  What is the point of\
  \ this?  I would like to create awareness among the youth regarding the importance\
  \ of Literature. Firstly, Literature is the kind of subject that gives one the freedom\
  \ to relate to it in whatever way they choose to. As a subject, in Literature you\
  \ may be assigned some  boring old novel  to read and study and then answer questions\
  \ regarding it. But a change of perspective is required in this regard. I have seen\
  \ students trying to deal with Literature as they would deal with a mathematical\
  \ problem, which is a horrifying spectacle. This is because students think that\
  \ when they are given a question on the novel or story, there is one answer to it,\
  \ which is not true (unless we are talking about comprehensions). Every single person\
  \ can give his or her own understanding of what they have read and interpreted in\
  \ regard to the writer s idea behind the story and present it as a justified answer.\
  \ This is what Literature does to your mind. It makes you read, analyze and question\
  \ the thinking of the writer whose story you are examining and then somehow relate\
  \ to it. Once you have done that, you would find that you are giving your very own\
  \ creative and analytical opinion as an answer. You thought hard over the writer\
  \ s perspective, deciphering the meanings behind his words, and then you linked\
  \ your own ideology with it, therefore giving an answer that is your very own original\
  \ and personal take on the writer and his or her story. You told us what you think\
  \ about the text and in the whole  thought process  of indulging yourself in reading\
  \ between the lines, you unconsciously allowed the intellectual wheels of your mind\
  \ to start rolling. This is what Literature does and this is why we study it. It\
  \ grooms the intellect of a young and fresh thinker. When you are reading books,\
  \ drama, poetry, short stories, essays or any piece of literary work, you are opening\
  \ the gateway to unbound imagination and allowing your intellect to grow by perceiving\
  \ so many ideas out there, provided to you in the form of words. And then you are\
  \ asked to dissect those words, question that piece of knowledge, examine that burst\
  \ of idea, scrutinize the symbolic meanings, and critically analyze the writer s\
  \ philosophy. You start dwelling on human nature and the situations that we as beings\
  \ find ourselves in, in this world. As a result, you develop a profound sense of\
  \ life. Your mind becomes perceptive, knowledgeable, polished and one that sees\
  \ the world with a deeper eye. That is the point of Literature. Arshiya Kausar,\
  \ Lahore. Bells and whistles  Sir, Pakistan has reached a remarkable milestone in\
  \ scientific research by becoming an associate member of the European Council for\
  \ Nuclear Research (CERN). Pakistan is the first Asian country to that became an\
  \ associate member and others are Turkey and Serbia. Geneva-based CERN is world\
  \ s leading physics research centre that was founded in 1953 by twelve European\
  \ nations. It leads the world in areas like particle and energy physics and had\
  \ invented World Wide Web besides several other discoveries to its credit. Pakistani\
  \ physicists have remained actively engaged with CERN for a long time and the associate\
  \ membership is recognition of their contributions to the Council, cutting edge\
  \ scientific research and to the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. It is recognition\
  \ that Pakistan is a responsible nuclear state with adept expertise in using civil\
  \ nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Nobel Laureate Dr Abdus Salam was the\
  \ first Pakistan scientist who worked with CERN in 1960s. Salam paved the way for\
  \ some thirty Pakistani scientists who were actively involved in the discovery of\
  \ the Higgs boson as been the subject of an intense scientific hunt. This collaboration\
  \ of Pakistan with CERN emphasizes the significance of scientific research and higher\
  \ education for economic and technological development in Pakistan. With the associate\
  \ membership, Pakistan will also get a student quota of around fifteen students.\
  \ There are several other benefits, such as developments in the field of science\
  \ and technology will contribute in many other areas such as medicine, homeland\
  \ security, industry, simulation of cancer treatments, reliability testing of nuclear\
  \ weapons, food sterilization, nuclear waste transmutation, and scanning of shipping\
  \ containers are by-products of physics research. Hasan Ehtisham, Islamabad. Quote\

text: ' After the passage of historic 18th Constitutional amendment, an editorial
  of monthly Hilal   a magazine published by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR)   marketed
  Pakistan s armed forces as a true federal institution. Critics have always described
  Pakistan s military as a  Punjab dominated institution  in terms of their composition,
  soul and spirit. In 2007, an information brief by the ISPR certified that in 2001
  Punjabis comprised over 71 percent of the army. However, the annual report on observance
  and implementation of Principles of Policy (Article 29-40) in relation to the affairs
  of the federation (2011-12) laid before the Parliament in August 2014 comes as a
  pleasant surprise. The Article 39 of Constitution says that,  The State shall enable
  people from all parts of Pakistan to participate in the Armed Forces of Pakistan.  Unlike
  justice-able Fundamental Rights (Article 8-28) the implementation of Principles
  of Policy is dependent on availability of resources. The report prepared by the
  Cabinet Division headed by the prime minister conveys a loud and clear message about
  the well thought out inclusive attempts to federalize the citizens in uniform. Unlike
  the prestigious civil services, there is no constitutionally guaranteed quota for
  the recruitment of people from various provinces in the armed forces. Nevertheless,
  affirmative action had been taken in the past. For example in July 1980, Sindh Regiment
  was raised to recruit Sindhis and pacify emerging resentment due to the Movement
  for the Restoration of Democracy against General Zia. In recent past, through similar
  affirmative action, about 10,000 officers and soldiers have been recruited from
  the troubled Balochistan since 2010. The report highlights the various steps taken
  to ensure the participation of people from all parts of the country in the armed
  forces. These efforts included focused awareness campaigns and special incentives
  such as two-year waivers in the upper age limit and 10 to 20 percent relaxation
  in college scores for the candidates from rural areas of Sindh, Balochistan, Azad
  Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and
  the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas. Whatsoever is the current composition
  of the armed forces today, the strategy adopted during the reporting period   from
  July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012   for recruitment indicates that in the near future,
  we will have federalized citizens in uniform. An analysis of recruitment figures
  reveals that the largest province Punjab still sends the maximum number of officers
  (1,018, or 59 percent) to Kakul (Pakistan Military Academy) and Risalpur (Air Force
  Academy). However, Sindh provides more officers than Punjab to Pakistan Navy. Khyber
  Pakhtunkhwa remains second in the list for Pakistan Army and Pakistan Air Force.
  The story of 48,639 soldiers, sailors and airmen recruited during 2011-12 is a replica
  of the pattern of officers  induction. The share of Balochistan in terms of officers
  in Pakistan Army still remains the lowest, at four percent. Out of 1,379 recruited
  officers only 55 were from Balochistan. In Pakistan Navy, out of 173 officers recruited
  during the period only 10 (6%) and in Pakistan Air Force out of the 171 officers
  only 7 (4%) were from Balochistan. In overall terms the share of Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan
  remains the lowest in Pakistan Navy (2%) and Pakistan Air Force (3.5%) in officer
  ranks. Traditionally, women have performed medical, educational and public relations
  work in all the three branches of the armed forces. It was only in 2007 that they
  were recruited for combat positions. However, the report does not offer any gender
  segregated data to portray the emerging picture. Similarly the citizens of other
  faiths (non-Muslims) are entitled to join the armed forces, but the report does
  not offer any information about their inclusion. The armed forces also recruit many
  civilians for various tasks.  All these recruitments strictly observe provincial
  and regional quotas as prescribed for all other civil departments,  the report says.
  The report claims that the affirmative action and incentivized initiatives have
  resulted in many positive effects, including national integration and an improved
  image of the armed forces. The newly inducted officers and soldiers, as per this
  policy, are a source of inspiration for potential candidates from the backward areas.
  One can hope that this positive awakening and concerted efforts and attempts to
  federalize the armed forces will cement federal bonds and alleviate the feelings
  of exclusion. '

text: ' Last week when the government announced a military operation against the militants
  in the troubled North Waziristan region, many were taken by surprise, including
  the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. Immediately, thousands of people started fleeing
  the area. According to latest estimates, the number of people who have registered
  themselves as Internally Displace People, or IDPs as they are commonly referred
  to, has reached 400,000. It is likely to rise to 600,000 in the next few days, according
  to Imran Khan, whose party heads the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. At first, there
  were no coordinated efforts to cope with the situation, resulting in the loss of
  five lives due to thirst and sunstroke on the way to Bannu. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
  government, in whose jurisdiction are the areas where most of the refugees are pouring
  in, asked the federal government to sit with it and devise a strategy to handle
  the situation. Meanwhile, the number of refugees arriving every day has lowered,
  and a number of NGOs have stepped in to help the government and the military take
  care of them. While I was in Bannu and the Bakakhel village of the frontier regions,
  I saw fleeing families traveling on the main Bannu-Mirali road on foot, in tractor
  trolleys, buses, trucks and mini vans in a scorching 41 degrees Celsius. Some of
  them brought their cattle with them, traveling for days and sleeping under the open
  sky. I spoke to many of them   young boys, little girls, and elders with gray beards.
  They were exhausted by the formidable journey and the lengthy search and registration
  process. Almost all of them were complaining about the unavailability of transport
  especially for cattle. Within days, transporters have raised their fares manifolds.
  The main problems of the refugees are a lack of organization in the distribution
  of relief goods, and a housing crisis in Bannu district. Most of the charity organizations
  involved in relief efforts belong to religious groups. Other charities, such as
  Edhi Foundation, Bacha Khan Educational Foundation and Pashtunkhwa Students Organization
  also have a presence, but the scope and impact of their efforts seemed much narrower.
  Most of these groups have set up stalls on the roadside, where they hand over sherbet
  and food to the passing IDPs. There is no coordinated effort to organize the availability
  of food and essentials and ensure all of them have access to relief goods in a transparent,
  fair, and sustainable way. Most IDPs want to rent or share houses in the city, instead
  of living in government-run camps. With a population of about one million, Bannu
  will find it hard to accommodate several hundred thousand new residents. So far,
  local residents have been generous in sharing their homes with the refugees, but
  these arrangements may not sustain if the operation continues for too long. Relief
  workers believe converting local schools and colleges into IDP camps during summer
  could resolve the housing problems, and also make registration and coordination
  easier.  Amid all the mismanagement, NADRA did a remarkable job registering about
  400,000 people in days. The decision by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to give out
  cash stipends instead of checks and smart cards was praised by the refugees. Many
  do want the government to increase the stipend   a meager Rs 7,000 per family from
  the federal government and Rs 5,000 from the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
  Jamaat-e-Islami s Sirajul Haq and noted journalist Saleem Safi have both raised
  this concern, saying the government must cut down the funding on infrastructure
  and laptop projects if it has to, to divert the money to the IDPs. As Ramzan approaches
  fast, the government may have to hurry up with the measures it has planned, make
  the relief activities more coordinated, and allow international humanitarian organizations
  to work in the area. If the concerns of the refugees who have left their homes for
  the rest of the country are not addressed, or are addressed only by charities run
  by Jihadi groups, the long-term outcome of the operation will be affected. Raza
  Wazir is a journalist from the Mirali town of North Waziristan '

text: ' Connectivity is an essential prerequisite for regional socio-economic development
  and the role of Pakistan can be of utmost importance in promoting development across
  South Asia and its neighboring regions. Although Pakistan has done a lot in improving
  its internal transportability mainly through roads, it still needs to do a lot more
  to transform it into a regional and trans-regional trading hub. The recently proposed
  Pak-China Economic Corridor Project can prove to be a cornerstone in achieving this
  status for Pakistan. The two south-Asian countries bordering Pakistan are India
  and Afghanistan. India is the second biggest economy after China among South-Asian,
  East-Asian and Southeast-Asian countries. China, being the biggest economy in the
  aforementioned regions, the second biggest economy in the world and enjoying a hearty
  relationship with Pakistan, is going to be significantly dependent on Pakistan through
  this economic corridor project. It is very important to mention here that strategists
  in China have written a lot about the  Malacca Dilemma  with these straits being
  a natural choking point and need to find an alternative route. It is also important
  to say here that roughly 80% of China s oil imports pass through these straits in
  the South China Sea and it is the only available maritime trading route for Chinese
  oil imports thus far. In a recently conducted study by Pradumna B Rana and Binod
  Karmachary as part of the Asian Development Bank Institute s (ADBI) working paper
  series, the authors said that China is looking for three alternate routes for its
  oil imports. The first is the proposed PRC Pakistan Economic Corridor passing through
  some of the highest and most landslide-prone mountains; the second one is the proposed
  Kunming Lao PDR Thailand Railway; and the third one are the pipelines with Central
  Asian countries and the Russian Federation. Given the long lasting bonhomie between
  Pakistan and China, the extent of the latter s investment which it has already made
  in Pakistan and an already existing Karakoram Highway; one may safely infer that
  the first option will be the top priority of the Chinese Government. Internally,
  China is also intensively working to implement its Go-West Policy since 2000 and
  it has heavily invested in infrastructure, mainly roads and power plants, to develop
  its inner provinces. A number of expressways have been constructed from the coastal
  cities of Shanghai and Beijing to the inner provinces. These include the Shanghai
  Xi an, Shanghai Chongqing Kunming, Shanghai Kunming, and Beijing Lhasa expressways.
  This Go-West policy signals that China is really interested to access the Arabian
  Sea finally through Pakistan for its oil imports on which its thriving industry
  is heavily dependent. There is also a proposal of establishing Rail link between
  China and Pakistan through the planned Pakistan China rail link project across the
  Karokoram mountain ranges. Coming back to South-Asian Regional Trade, it is noteworthy
  here that Pakistan has not been able to reach to the markets of Bangladesh, Bhutan
  and Nepal through India. Given the critical nature of relationship between Pakistan
  and India, it is a big ask, because as of now, even the total trade between Pakistan
  and India is only $ 2.5 billion although they are neighbours and there are several
  road transport links available between these two countries. Pakistan has not given
  the MFN status to India so far, but the recently started debut road trade in 137
  agricultural items through Wagah-Attari border between Pakistan and India is an
  important breakthrough given the acrimonious history of relationship between the
  two countries. But, a lot more still needs to be done and more and more tariff lines
  may be allowed to be traded through this route. It is also important that the parleys
  are on as well to open up Munabao-Khokhrapar border and Hussaini Wala-Ganda Singh
  Wala border between the two nations. The Ganda Singh Wala village famous for its
  bamboo industry on Pakistan s side has gained a huge economic importance after the
  construction of double road between Lahore and Kasur. Internally, India has completed
  the Golden Quadrilateral Project, which improves connectivity between the four major
  nodal cities in the country Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. Moreover, as a
  component of its  Look East  policy, India is actively promoting connectivity with
  Southeast Asia. If the mistrust between India and Pakistan can be done away with
  in the near or distant future and the quality of relationship in various spheres
  ameliorates, Pakistan can greatly bank on these infrastructural developments within
  India and tap the markets of Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. Furthermore, Pakistan
  can also have an alternate trading route with Southeast Asia, which is already its
  major trading region. Another important aspect to mention here is that not only
  Nepal becomes easily accessible through road if Pak-India trade links improve, but
  also Pakistan s access to major Chinese inner cities of Kunming, Chengdu and Chongqing
  becomes a lot more accessible and a far less distant. For example the distance between
  Lahore to Delhi is 426kms and the distance between Delhi to Kunming via land and
  sea route is 10,345kms. This Delhi-Kunming distance will only be 2887kms, if India
  starts trading via land route through Nepal. Similarly, Delhi-Chongqing distance
  via land and sea route is 10,669kms and it will only be 3,151kms through Nepal.
  And Delhi-Chengdu distance via land and sea route is 10,437kms and it will only
  be 2,911kms through Nepal. If we see towards Central Asia, the stability within
  Afghanistan significantly matters and once that is achieved and Pak-Afghan relationship
  improves, the Central Asian markets will also be open for Pakistani products. So
  in this way, we see that South-Asia, East-Asia, Southeast-Asia and the Central Asia
  in general and Pakistan in particular can greatly be benefitted by these mutual
  endeavours and understandings. The writer is a Section Officer in the

  Ministry of Commerce

text: ' The stalled Afghan peace process has been brought to a grinding halt with
  a drone strike. Following a lackluster meeting of the Quadrilateral Coordination
  Committee (QCG)   which followed an outburst by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who
  said in so many words that he was wrong to trust Pakistan to deliver the Afghan
  Taliban to the negotiating table   the United States has taken out the leader of
  the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor. The fact that he was inside Pakistani
  territory comes as no surprise, but the jury is still out on what the ramifications
  of his death will be, to both the peace process and relations between Kabul and
  Islamabad. The killing [of Mansur] will not increase the Taliban s willingness to
  enter into talks , says Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network,
  based in Kabul.  They will be enraged about the targeting of their leader which
  offer to talk   by the last QCB meeting   still had been on the table. Days after
  the strike, on May 25, the Taliban announced their new leader: Mullah Haibatullah
  Akhunzada. Sirajuddin Haqqani (the former number two) and Mullah Yaqoob (the son
  of the founding emir Mullah Omar) have been named his deputies. Haibatullah is not
  known for his bravery on the battlefield, and instead is respected as a religious
  cleric, or Alim, having been a leading member of the Taliban judiciary. The decision
  comes much sooner than expected. Experts believed the Taliban would take their time
  to ensure whoever they chose would be accepted by the entire movement.  The choice
  of an Alim is clever, as it gives Haibatullah religious authority which the commanders
  will have to accept,  says Ruttig. The Taliban seem to be trying to stay away from
  the succession problems the movement saw in the aftermath of Mullah Omar s death.
  However, his close relationship with Mullah Mansoor is also well known.  Mullah
  Rasool and his followers will not accept Mullah Haibatullah   The status quo has
  been maintained,  says Rahimullah Yousufzai, a longtime expert on Afghanistan and
  one of the first journalists to report on the Taliban movement.  He will follow
  the same policies as his predecessor.  What that means is the continuation of the
  offensive against the Ghani government and coalition forces, and no inclinations
  towards talks. But concerns about the succession project still remain. After the
  death of the first emir, a violent struggle had ensued between Mullah Mansoor and
  Mullah Yaqoob.  Mullah Yaqoob is immensely popular, and maybe this is how he is
  being prepared to take over the Taliban throne,  says Yousufzai. There is also the
  matter of Mullah Rasool, one of the key supporters of Mullah Yaqoob. Currently holed
  up in a Pakistani jail, Rasool and his followers were not part of the consultation
  process to choose the new chief. Instead, only the Taliban supreme council   the
  Rahbari Shura, or the Quetta Shura  decided on the new chief. Mullah Rasool and
  his followers will not accept Haibatullah and will continue to promote young Mullah
  Yaqoob,  warns Yousufzai. The concerns are heightened when seen in the context of
  recent reports suggesting the Afghan government had been giving financial and military
  support to a breakaway faction of the Taliban in an effort to move some of its leaders
  towards peace talks. At the same time, a senior Taliban commander named Mullah Zakir
  Qayyum released a letter earlier in April, proposing a  new strategy  that included
  negotiations not only with the United States but also the government in Kabul. Mullah
  Qayyum had initially refused to pledge allegiance to the erstwhile leader of the
  movement, and had only done so very recently. Which way he turns now will be important.
  Such rifts within the movement and efforts by the Kabul government to create divisions
  within the ranks of the Taliban were also present during the time of Mullah Omar.
  But while the founding emir of the movement succeeded in keeping the cadres together,
  will Mullah Haibatullah deliver the unity the group needs? According to a news report,
  Haibatullah is  an old man, much older than Mullah Omar . How long he stays in power,
  and how much influence he has, is anybody s guess. Regardless, Pakistan finds itself
  in an unenviable place. The allegations of the Afghan Taliban leadership being inside
  Pakistani territory have turned out to be true. The QCG is all but dead. And while
  Islamabad was unable to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table, it has become
  even harder now, with their leader having been killed.  I don t see a major shift
  in policy happening,  says Yousufzai. Pakistan s current Afghan policy is linked
  to numerous other matters, including but not limited to relations with the United
  States, with Afghanistan, India and its increasing influence there, and now Iran
  as well. Instead, in an effort to remain relevant, Pakistan may look to exert more
  pressure and influence on the Taliban. But as has often been witnessed in such matters,
  the Taliban will eventually do what is in their best interests and not follow dictation
  beyond a certain point. How does Pakistan remain relevant then?  The fact remains
  that Mansoor was close to Pakistan, and this created a lot of resentment within
  the Taliban about how the movement was being influenced,  says journalist and author
  Ahmed Rashid.  What Pakistan needs to do is use its leverages within the group to
  push it towards talks.  Any more meddling will create further resentment, not only
  amongst the Taliban but the Afghan population at large   something Pakistan does
  not need. '

text: 'Monitoring Desk ISLAMABAD: A new study has shown that severely obese patients
  undergoing weight loss surgery are more likely to have increased fracture risks
  both before and after the surgical procedure. The study, published in the journal
  The BMJ, suggested that fracture risk assessment and management should be part of
  weight loss care and obesity may not be as protective for fracture as originally
  thought. The researchers speculated that the increased fracture risks are due to
  obesity-related conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as anatomical changes,
  and nutritional deficiencies induced by weight loss surgery. The study examined
  the incidence and sites of fracture in severely obese patients who had undergone
  weight loss surgery and compared them to obese and non-obese controls matched for
  sex and age.  The study represents an important contribution to the evidence on
  the management of patients after weight loss surgery. Fracture risk assessment should

  heritage are an integral part of modern Britain they and make a huge contribution.
  Theresa May was addressing a reception organised at 10 Downing Street to welcome
  over 100 leading British Muslims for the Eid al-Fitr. British Pakistani Minister
  for Commonwealth Lord Tariq Ahmed welcomed the guests with the PM and thanked her
  for supporting Muslims and having a good understanding of the issues they face.
  Theresa May, who was famously introduced to her husband at the Oxford University
  by late Benazir Bhutto, told its only appropriate to celebrate the contribution
  of British Muslims.  Today, we see British Muslims and people of Muslim heritage
  contributing at the highest levels of public life, and I am delighted that Sajid
  Javid, the Communities Secretary is here with us along with Lord Tariq Ahmad of
  Wimbledon, who serves as a minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. A British
  Muslim Sadiq Khan is the Mayor of our capital city, Muslims serve in government,
  in Parliament, in the devolved administrations, in local government, the civil service,
  our armed forces and public services, in business, medicine, the law and the arts.
  This contribution adds enormously to our cultural and social diversity and it is
  something of which we can all be proud. And pride is important, because in the UK,
  we rightly take pride in being an open and diverse multi-ethnic and multi-faith
  democracy.  Theresa May spoke against recent attacks on Muslims across Britain and
  said there is no place for such elements who pose risk to lives of innocent citizens.
  She appreciated Muslims for saving the Finsbury Park mosque attacker and victims
  of the tragedy at Grenfell Tower.  The Britain which I think we all want to see,
  and which I am determined to help build, is one which truly does work for everyone   from
  every background, any faith, and all races. A country where success in life depends
  only on a person s talents and willingness to work hard. A fairer, more prosperous
  and more united Britain where the opportunity of a better life is within everyone
  s reach. We can all help to build a Britain that works for everyone, and I urge
  everyone here tonight to take that message back to your local communities.  She
  said that people of Muslim faith have been recognised in the Honours list every
  year for the role they play and that s reflective of how much they are valued. '

text: 'Many bodybuilding products sold online are mislabeled and contain unapproved
  drugs and other ingredients that may not be safe, a new study suggests. Researchers
  tested 44 products they bought online that were marketed as nonsteroidal selective
  androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), which mimic the effect of testosterone and
  help build muscle. Overall, only about half of these items actually contained SARMs,
  the study found. One in four products contained ingredients that weren t on the
  label, including potentially dangerous drugs, and 59% had more or less than the
  advertised amounts of certain ingredients.  Our findings show that people should
  be extremely careful about using these unapproved drugs purchased over the internet
  not only because these drugs can have harmful effects on their health, but also
  because the labels cannot be trusted and many products may contain other chemicals
  not listed on the label whose safety is unknown,  said study co-author Dr. Shalender
  Bhasin of Harvard Medical School Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston. Anabolic
  steroids are among the most frequently abused appearance- and performance-enhancing
  drugs, researchers note online November 28 in JAMA. Use of these drugs was once
  mostly limited to athletes, but they ve gained in popularity among men seeking to
  build muscle and appear more fit. SARMs are designed to have effects similar to
  steroids, and several companies are developing SARMs as potential treatment for
  functional limitations associated with aging and muscle-wasting disorders. The US
  Food and Drug Administration hasn t approved any SARMs to treat these medical problems.
  These unapproved drugs are marketed as dietary supplements even though they haven
  t been reviewed for safety or effectiveness, the FDA has warned. Consumers shouldn
  t use SARMs in bodybuilding products because they can have life-threatening side
  effects such as heart attacks, strokes and severe liver damage, the FDA has warned.
  SARMS, like anabolic steroids, are among the substances athletes aren t allowed
  to use under rules outlined by the World Anti-Doping Agency. For the study, researchers
  searched online for suppliers selling SARMs and bought all of the items they found
  that were in stock and possible to purchase. Then, the study team had all of the
  products they bought tested using protocols followed by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
  Some products were found to contain a drug that increases growth hormone and other
  substances that are also banned by that agency, the study found. Four products were
  found to contain the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. Most undisclosed substances found
  in the tested products were themselves experimental. Some of the compounds   Ostarine,
  Andarine, LGD-4033 and ibutamoren   have been tested in humans even though they
  have not yet won approval by the FDA. Development of another compound found in tested
  products, GW-501516, was halted because of safety concerns. Another compound discovered
  in the products, SR9009, has been through some preliminary clinical trials but hasn
  t yet been tested in humans.  But people do spend millions of dollars on unregulated
  drugs every day   and at their peril,  said Dr Richard Auchus, author of an accompanying
  editorial and a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Vitamin D
  and calcium are the only supplements people should buy, and even then consumers
  should only shop from legitimate suppliers like the website for a drugstore chain,
  Auchus advised. That s because the current study highlights problems with supplements
  that go beyond just SARMs, which may lure a subset of the bodybuilding community
  with a distrust of medical professionals and a penchant for risk-taking behaviour,
  Anchus said by email.  This is one of many warnings about such supplements that
  scam and endanger the public,  Auchus added. '

text: 'DUBAI: The Pakistan cricket team has added left-arm fast bowler Wahab Riaz
  in place of seamer Hassan Ali; the leading wicket-taker of the ICC Champions Trophy
  is rested due to a side strain. Hassan Ali had been troubled with fitness problems
  since the last month when he also missed the second T20 against World XI team.  Pakistan
  once again chose to retain their main spinner Yasir Shah in the lineup along with
  three fast bowlers for the second and third Test match of the series against Sri
  Lanka held in Dubai. The remainder of the side remains unchanged from the first
  game   that Sri Lankans narrowly won in Abu Dhabi''s Sheikh Zayed Stadium. The Sri
  Lankan team are in high spirits after the first match and have only made two changes
  for the second Test. Debutants Sadeera Samarawickrama and Lahiru Gamage come in
  to the side as replacements for injured batsman Lahiru Thirimanne and spinner Lakshan
  Sandakan, respectively. Samarawickrama received his Test cap from batting coach
  Hashan Tillakaratne, whereas Gamage earned his from bowling coach Rumesh Ratnayake.
  It appears that Sri Lankans are looking to strengthen their seam attack, as they
  included the right-arm, fast-medium Gamage in place of Sandakan   who stayed wicketless
  in the first Test. Speaking about the behaviour of the pitch, skipper Dinesh Chandimal
  indicated a day prior to the Test that the track in Dubai could be helpful and supportive
  to the seamers. This is the sixth day/night Test match following International Cricket
  Council s (ICC) approval in a bid to improve the popularity of the longest form
  cricket. The Test that has commenced in Dubai International Cricket Stadium, is
  Sri Lanka s maiden pink-ball game. while Pakistan is playing their third day/night
  Test.  Interestingly, Pakistan played their first pink-ball Test against West Indies
  in Dubai, wherein Azhar Ali opened the innings and made an undefeated masterful
  triple century at 302 runs, declaring at 579/3. Unfortunately, they were miserly
  bundled out for 123 runs in the second innings. West Indies right-arm leg break
  bowler Devendra Bishoo thrashed Pakistan s experienced batting line-up and took
  eight wickets.  Pakistan will now have to face Rangana Herath   another master of
  spin, who has already steered his team to clinch a victory in Abu Dhabi with his
  terrific bowling. The Pakistani skipper Sarfraz Ahmed showed his confidence in the
  batting line-up and expressed hope that Pakistani batsmen will attack Sri Lankan
  bowlers. Babar Azam, the middle-order batsman who received his Test cap at the Dubai
  cricket stadium last year in the Day and Night Test, was unfortunately exposed by
  Sri Lankan seamers and spinners in both innings of the Abu Dhabi Test. Nevertheless,
  he has been given a chance to prove his skills in the Test format again. '

  and one man was sentenced last year after pleading guilty at the start of the first
  trial.  They were sentenced to 127 years in total. All of the offenders committed
  offences against one girl who was aged between 14 and 18 when most of the abuse
  happened.  Three of the men also committed offences against other victims. Afraz
  Ahmed was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Choudhry Ikhlaq Hussain was convicted
  in his absence and is currently wanted by police. He was sentenced in his absence
  to 19 years in prison.  Rehan Ali was sentenced to 7 years, Kutab Miah to 9 years,
  Mohammed Dauood 16 years, Abid Khan to 6 years 6 months, Mohammed Zahid to 5 years,
  David Law was to 11 years in prison. A man who cannot be named for legal reasons
  was sentenced to 23 years in prison plus 8 years on extended license. Mahfuz Rahman
  pleaded guilty to three counts of Sexual Activity with a child and was sentenced
  to 5 years and 6 months in prison at the beginning of the first trial. Following
  the sentencing Alison Cartmell, Senior Crown Prosecutor from CPS North West Complex
  Casework Unit said:  The offenders targeted their victims because of their age and
  the vulnerable situations they were in at the time.   They pretended to be their
  friends and, in some cases, their boyfriends, but in fact they set out to groom
  them and exploit them for their own ends.  Some of the men plied their victims with
  large amounts of alcohol or drugs as a way of controlling or even incapacitating
  them.  Some used violence and threats to intimidate and coerce them into having
  sex.   I hope that today s outcome will act as a warning to those who abuse and
  exploit children in this way that tackling these crimes remains a priority for police
  and prosecutors and I hope it provides other victims of sexual abuse with the confidence
  to contact the police and to seek support.  '

language: en

summary: null

text: 'LONDON/GENEVA: Booming global trade and economic growth have cushioned world
  markets against the political turbulence of Donald Trump s first year in the White
  House, but that resilience will be tested if the US president wants protectionism
  to define 2018.  With stocks on one of their longest bull runs in history, they
  are particularly vulnerable to upsets, although the global economy s strength means
  they could probably absorb greater trade conflict - provided governments keep it
  all within limits. Emboldened after finally pushing his signature tax cut reforms
  through Congress, Trump seems likely to train his sights on trade   another pillar
  of his election pledge to  Make America Great Again    by fixing its deficit and
  punishing countries deemed to be profiting at US expense. His administration is
  beating the trade drum ever louder. This month, it has announced steep US tariffs
  on imported washing machines and solar cells, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has
  warned China over intellectual property practices and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin
  has endorsed a weaker dollar to help American exports. Discussing trade wars at
  the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ross said:  US troops are now coming to the ramparts.  That
  warning provoked only a short-lived wobble in world stocks, with investors reluctant
  to bail out of a market still clocking record highs at an accelerating pace even
  after adding $9 trillion in value last year. Much of that bullishness is down to
  a sustained rebound in trade in recent years, with volumes growing at a faster pace
  than world gross domestic product. Despite Trump s protectionist rhetoric of the
  past year and actions such as pulling the United States out of the TPP trade pact
  for Pacific Rim countries, indicators show no let-up. Global trade is expanding
  at annualized rates of more than 4 percent, the strongest performance since 2011,
  according to the Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis. Freight volumes
  are surging at the fastest pace this decade. Merchandise trade is likely to have
  expanded 3.6 percent in 2017 in volume terms, rebounding from the post-crisis low
  of 1.3 percent growth in 2016, the World Trade Organization reckons. Overall, the
  IMF forecasts global GDP will expand 3.9 percent this year.  But investors fear
  a shift from rhetoric to action may still hurt markets even if the robust growth
  acts as a shock absorber.  Protectionism means lower growth and higher inflation.
  That s the worst possible combination you can have when markets are at record highs,  said
  Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. However, the world economy
  s strength and double-digit company earnings allow markets to  absorb a lot , Paolini
  said. He cited short-lived reactions to Britain s impending exit from the European
  Union, political upsets elsewhere on the continent such as Catalonia s failed referendum
  on independence from Spain and North Korea s nuclear weapons program as examples
  of how much flak the market was able to take. Protectionism is neither new nor a
  US monopoly. Since 2008, the 60 top world economies have adopted over 7,000 protectionist
  trade measures in net terms, international law firm Gowling WLG reported last November.
  And yet these have failed to scupper the bull market in equities. Among the upcoming
  flashpoints are talks with Mexico and Canada on Trump s demand that the North American
  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) be renegotiated. His State of the Union speech later
  on Tuesday could also detail steps against China s tech sector. A US Treasury report
  on trade partners  currency practices, plus decisions on steel and aluminum import
  restrictions, are due in April.  (A trade shock) is something you have to keep in
  mind, given how stretched markets are but there has to be a credible decision, not
  just a threat,  Paolini said. What''s the damage? Most expect forthcoming curbs,
  and the fallout, to be limited. Trade wars have had little direct impact on equity
  markets in the past, JPMorgan analysts wrote, citing a dispute between Washington
  and Tokyo in 1993-95 over Japanese car exports to the United States as an example.
  Trump could double or triple the number of trade penalties  without harming risky
  markets more than intra-week , they said, adding that they had made no portfolio
  changes to account for additional trade risks. Even 100 percent tariffs on steel
  and aluminium would dent Chinese exports by just 0.3 percentage points, while semiconductor
  and telecommunications import curbs may lower exports by 0.8 percentage points,
  Morgan Stanley said. Given multinational firms  reliance on complex cross-border
  supply chains, Wall Street would undoubtedly suffer but other markets may be hurt
  more. The United States, relying on trade for 28 percent of its economic output,
  has less to lose than Mexico, with a trade-to-GDP ratio of 78 percent or Germany
  with 84 percent. China s ratio is 34 percent, World Bank data shows. As a result,
  any US pullout from NAFTA would cut 2019 GDP by half a percent in the United States,
  while reducing Mexico s by almost 1 percent, Oxford Economics predicts, adding that
  Mexico s economy could be 2 percent smaller by 2022. However, it is Asia that accounts
  for three-quarters of the US goods trade deficit   led by China, South Korea and
  Japan   and over a third of global exports. The annual deficit with China at $370
  billion is the biggest, implying that this is where Trump and Ross have set their
  sights. Some analysts argue that the United States would also lose if trade partners
  retaliated by cutting purchases of American goods or halting supplies of components
  to US firms, perhaps along the lines of China s decision in 2010 to ban exports
  of rare earth metals to Japanese electronics makers. Another threat lies in the
  quest for a weaker dollar, should that spur inflation by pushing up the cost of
  imports in the United States. This could prompt faster and bigger rises in interest
  rates which feed through to equity markets. But Trump may be wary of disrupting
  the equity boom which he has cited as evidence of his administration s successful
  policies.  At today s (share price) valuations, a trade war would be material,  said
  Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.  I m
  sure he s received a lot of advice that a trade war would damage the Dow.  '

  give the accountability court till December 15 to conclude the remaining two references.
  However, the chief justice observed,  We cannot grant such a long extension.   We
  do not want to interfere in the accountability court s trial,  Justice Nisar remarked
  and granted a six-week extension in the deadline. On July 6, after four extensions
  in the original six-month deadline to conclude all three cases, the court had announced
  its verdict in the Avenfield reference. Accountability court Judge Mohammad Bashir
  had announced the verdict handing the ousted prime minister 10 years as jail time
  and seven years to his daughter Maryam Nawaz. The trial against the Sharif family
  commenced on September 14, 2017. Nawaz and his sons, Hussain and Hasan, are accused
  in all three references whereas Maryam and Safdar were accused in the Avenfield

text: "Easy on the pocket housing shrinking in Rawalpindi\n\nLow-income Pindiites\
  \ are finding it more and more difficult to find a reasonably priced house to live.\
  \ Easy on the pocket accommodation is shrinking in Rawalpindi.\n\u201CIn the last\
  \ few years period, the numbers of affordable housing units, that is to say, for\
  \ the households with incomes at or below Rs.10, 000 has dropped. This drop, coupled\
  \ with overall rent increases, has meant that low-income working families, along\
  \ with many kids and elderly, are forced to pay disproportionate amounts of their\
  \ monthly incomes on rent alone, with too little left for food and other necessities,\u201D\
  \ says Karamat Ali, a private sector employee.\n\u201CThose in transition from joblessness\
  \ to work are particularly vulnerable, because housing costs consume so much of\
  \ their small pay. In the last two years, rents across the city jumped at twice\
  \ the rate of inflation,\u201D says Shaukat Hussain, who found job after a long\
  \ respite.\n\u201CLandlords have raised their rents at a more rapid rate than that\
  \ which prevailed in the earlier years of the decade. While the stock of affordable\
  \ housing has been decreasing, moreover, the number of tenants with incomes below\
  \ 30 percent of the middle has grown. At present, one in four tenants are in this\
  \ position, and they are in painful competition for the little housing that is available\
  \ within their price range,\u201D says Shazia Hussain, a working widow.\n\u201C\
  At least 40 percent of tenants cannot pay the rent for a two-bedroom house. Minimum-wage\
  \ earners are particularly hard hit by the combination of escalating rents and the\
  \ increasing scarcity of units within their income range. Nowhere in the city is\
  \ the minimum wage sufficient to allow for the rental of a two-bedroom house at\
  \ the fair market rent,\u201D says Hasan Murteza, a factory worker.\n\u201CThe rent\
  \ of one-storey three-marla, four-marla and five-marla house is fixed. One-bedroom\
  \ house is priced highly. The rent is set at the whim of property dealers, so they\
  \ fleece the tenants to ensure their commission,\u201D says Baksheesh Hussain, an\
  \ IT guy.\n\u201CI get a small salary and have to work part-time in order to pay\
  \ for my two-bedroom house. For the poor, rise in rents has exacerbated the search\
  \ for a reasonable place to live,\u201D says Hussain Taqi, a father of two kids.\n\
  \u201CMost of the housing is made available to working people with somewhat higher\
  \ incomes. There are fewer housing options for the poorest. Ways to shorten the\
  \ affordability gap are not hard to find.\_ The government needs to further raise\
  \ the minimum wage, which would help to put more workers in a better position to\
  \ rent at prices they cannot now afford,\u201D says Afaq Ali, a political worker.\n\
  \u201CPindiites are being fleeced by landlords, who often demand increased rent\
  \ with threats of eviction. I have shifted my dwelling three times in a year. My\
  \ house belongings have got damaged in the process,\u201D says Wajahat Ali, a private\
  \ school teacher.\n\u201CMy landlord never spends the money he gets from me as rent\
  \ on the house I live in. He hasn\u2019t had any work done on it apart from the\
  \ poor paint when I rented the house five years ago,\u201D says Farhat Abbas, who\
  \ runs a small grocery shop.\n\u201COur problem is being met with almost total silence\
  \ from the city fathers. How many of them have rented their family home all their\
  \ lives from a private landlord?\_ How many of them would prefer to live in the\
  \ cold damp house we live in,\u201D adds Farhat."

  \nPESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday suspended the recommendation\
  \ of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) for the transfer of the cases of two\
  \ Afghan nationals to a military court.\nA two-member bench comprising of Chief\
  \ Justice Mazhar Alam Miankhel and Justice Irshad Qaiser suspended the recommendation\
  \ for transferring the cases of the two brothers to the military court.\nThe court\
  \ also issued notice to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, directing it to submit\
  \ its reply and explain why the cases were recommended to the military court as\
  \ the two were charged with the extortion.\nThe court asked the government to explain\
  \ before the court that whether the officials of the CTD were authorised to recommend\
  \ the cases to the military court. The court also asked Additional Advocate General\
  \ of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Umar Farooq Adam to submit a reply about the government\u2019\
  s procedure as to who was authorised to transfer cases to the military courts.\n\
  During the course of hearing, the lawyer for the petitioners, Jamil Warsak, submitted\
  \ before the court that the two Afghan nationals Hizbullah and Mohibullah were arrested\
  \ on July 7, 2015 by the CTD on the complaint of a citizen from Faqirabad locality\
  \ for demanding Rs1 million extortion from him.\nHe said the CTD police arrested\
  \ the accused after tracing the telephone data record and charged them under Section\
  \ 7(H) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) Section 506 of the Pakistan Penal Code.\n\
  The lawyer said that both the anti-terrorism court and PHC had dismissed bail petition\
  \ of the arrested Afghan nationals in extortion case.\_ Jamil Warsak said the high\
  \ court had also directed the anti-terrorism court to conclude the trial within\
  \ three months.\nHowever, the lawyer said that the CTD officials on August 28, 2015\
  \ had wrote a letter to the high ups in the provincial government recommending that\
  \ the trial of the Afghan nationals be conducted in the military court.\nJamil Warsak\
  \ lawyer submitted that the CTD had no power to recommend cases to the military\
  \ courts as the authority rested with the provincial government to do so. The lawyer\
  \ argued that the cases of those accused were transferred to the military courts,\
  \ who were charged under the Action (in Aid of Civil Power) Regulations 2011, Pakistan\
  \ Protection Act and Pakistan Army Act. He said that extortion cases were heard\
  \ by the special ant-terrorism courts.\n\_\n\_"

  \ High Court on Wednesday sought replies from Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)\
  \ on a petition challenging process of the scrutiny of candidates for upcoming senate\
  \ election.Advocate Azhar Siddique, the petitioner, mainly questioned the scrutiny\

  \ in a transparent manner.The petitioner also questioned \u201CThe Election Act\
  \ 2017\u201D and argued that the ECP was not bound to implement the amendments introduced\
  \ under the act in virtue with Article 218 (3) of the Constitution.Advocate Siddique\
  \ pleaded that if the elections were not stayed the constitutional provisions would\
  \ be negated and violated the settled principles of law read with constitutional\
  \ provisions. He alleged that all the parties in the parliament with malafide intention,\
  \ collusively and cleverly ensured non-disclosure of essential details in the nomination\
  \ forms to be used in the forthcoming elections.He said the parties failed to realise\
  \ that it was a requirement of the supreme law of the land as concealing vital information\
  \ relating to payment of taxes and written off loans etc was in conflict with Articles\
  \ 62 and 63 of the Constitution.He pleaded that the disclosure of the said requirements\
  \ was constitutional obligation and could not be waived or relaxed under the impugned\
  \ Election Act, 2017.He argued that the process of scrutiny of the candidates for\
  \ senate polls was defective in terms of Articles 62 and & 63.Therefore, he asked\
  \ the court to set aside the scrutiny process of senate election till removal of\
  \ errors in the Election Act, 2017 by the relevant authorities. Justice Shahid Karim\
  \ heard the arguments and issued notices to the respondents for Feb 20.Stay extended:\

  \ Tehreek in Model Town killings\u2019 case.A full bench headed by Justice Abdul\

  \ Rai Bashir Ahmad could not turn up.However, the former police chief was there\
  \ along with his counsel. The bench expressed dismay over his non-appearance and\
  \ extended stay on summons issued to the former provincial police chief. Previously,\
  \ the bench also expressed dismay over non-appearance of PAT\u2019s counsel but\
  \ even then the respondents\u2019 counsel could not appear.Sukhera through his counsel\

text: "What is good for heart is good for head\nIslamabad: The loss of cognitive functions\
  \ is dreaded as it not only limits mobility but also affects peoples\u2019 relationships\
  \ with their near and dear ones. Most of us underestimate the power of dietary choices\
  \ in supporting brain health. There are no special foods to buy. It is the consumption\
  \ of a variety of brain-boosting foods, or a dietary pattern, that makes a real\
  \ difference in keeping our brain healthy.Consultant nutritionist at Shifa International\
  \ Hospital (SIH) Dr. Rezzan Khan shared this piece of information while talking\
  \ to \u2018The News\u2019 here Tuesday in connection with World Dieticians Day,\
  \ which is observed every year on March 14. SIH too will observe the day today (Wednesday)\
  \ with an awareness lecture, health advice by experts, and free BMI tests and consultancy\
  \ with qualified dieticians. The day spotlights the profession and reminds us that\
  \ dieticians are the trusted choice for reliable life-changing food and nutrition\
  \ advice. They use their specialized knowledge and skills to translate the science\
  \ of nutrition into terms everyone can understand to unlock food\u2019s potential\
  \ and support healthy living for all.\u201CThe brain utilises 20 percent of the\
  \ entire energy supply from the body for heartbeat, respiration, wakefulness, sleep,\
  \ and digestion, to name just a few. This energy supply from the food that you eat\
  \ can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form\
  \ of poison. The brain, like the cardiovascular system, depends on good blood flow\
  \ for optimal functioning. Heart-healthy lifestyle choices such as regular physical\
  \ activity and a healthful dietary pattern are, therefore, good ways to keep the\
  \ brain healthy and the memory sharp. What is good for the heart is good for the\
  \ head,\u201D Dr. Rezzan stated.Asked to share the particular nutrients or food\
  \ components that stand out for their brain-boosting powers, Dr. rezxzan counted\
  \ Omega-3 fatty acids, in particular, as a promising nutrient. She said the consumption\
  \ of adequate vitamins and minerals (dietary or supplemental) is associated with\
  \ lower risk of developing cognitive deficits. The B vitamins and vitamins E, C,\
  \ and D specifically have been identified as playing important roles in maintaining\
  \ normal brain function, she informed.In 2018, studies show promising results for\
  \ omega-9s fatty acids (also known as monounsaturated fats) for their potential\
  \ to regulate blood sugar levels and promote a healthy weight. Consuming foods rich\
  \ in omega-9 fatty acids instead of other types of fat may have a number of beneficial\
  \ health effects. Popular foods containing omega-9 include sunflower, hazelnut,\
  \ safflower, macadamia nuts, soybean oil, olive oil, canola oil, almond butter and\
  \ avocado oil.\u201CIt is best to focus your diet on getting a good balance of omega-3,\
  \ -6 and -9 fatty acids. This should involve eating at least two portions of oily\
  \ fish per week and using olive oil for cooking and in salad dressing,\u201D Dr.\
  \ Rezzan advised.Emphasizing richly coloured fruits and vegetables and cooking with\
  \ herbs and spices can boost vitamin and phytochemical (vitamin like substances)\
  \ intake. \u201CWe recommend these dark coloured fruits and vegetables since these\
  \ are naturally rich in phytochemicals that reduce oxidative stress and protect\
  \ the brain from inflammation. Herbs and spices make foods flavourful and add beneficial\
  \ phytochemicals like curcumin (yellow pigment in turmeric) to the diet,\u201D the\

  \ in the final interview of the former director of United Nations Development Programme\

  \ seemed to have lost the optimism that is usually the hallmark of all \u2018development\u2019\
  \ rhetoric.\nBut unlike his predecessors, he made his frustration public. Not long\

  \ about the dreadful state of affairs that characterise public health and its devastating\
  \ socio-economic consequences on the country. For once, they have everybody talking,\
  \ at least for now.\nThings being as they are, do we really need men from another\

  \ 40 percent coupled with 44 percent chronic child malnutrition (highest in the\
  \ world), not to mention our stone-age literacy standards, should send shockwaves\
  \ down the collective conscience of a civilised society.\nRest assured, such statistics\
  \ of doom and gloom have been thrown around for decades to stir governments into\
  \ action. There is a whole sea of NGOs and research institutes out there along with\
  \ government departments that collect and dispense data on a wide assortment of\
  \ social issues and ongoing development programmes. Countless seminars, workshops\
  \ and coordination meetings are routinely conducted by various UN agencies involving\
  \ government dignitaries and concerned line department officials.\nSome of the content\

  \ challenges\u2019 facing the nation, only to be ridiculed later by an absolute\
  \ disregard from the very public officials who are supposed to lead the way in materialising\
  \ their cherished vision.\nTrue to form, the seriousness of the government in upholding\
  \ those grandiose virtues of libert\xE9 has been pretty evident in the way it continues\
  \ to play hide and seek on national matters of accountability. Only recently the\
  \ federal minister for planning and development patently declared that CPEC details\
  \ cannot be made public. If anything, that amounts to blind-folding the national\
  \ vision.\nIn their seminal work in institutional economics, titled \u2018Why nations\
  \ fail\u2019, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson put together a heap of evidence\
  \ to suggest that all economic misfortune is the result of extractive institutions\
  \ implanted by a parasitic political elite that relentlessly seeks to perpetuate\
  \ its hold on power. It doesn\u2019t take a PhD in Economics to figure out the rot\
  \ that afflicts economic development in Pakistan.\nMillions of disillusioned ordinary\
  \ folk find themselves excluded from the power structures of a polarised society.\
  \ How do you explain the adversity of a country one of whose prime ministers in\
  \ a 2012 live interview before a global audience callously admonished his people\
  \ to leave the country if they didn\u2019t feel satisfied with his governance.\n\
  Sixty-nine years into its lame existence, the vicious cycle of petty political squabbles,\
  \ vile intrigues and self-consolatory blame game continues to defy good sense in\
  \ this land of the pure. From the first military takeover to the cessation of East\
  \ Pakistan and the horrors of our time, the adage \u2018our country is passing through\
  \ a critical phase\u2019 has been utterly sapped of its meaning and consequence\
  \ by various generations of rulers.\nBut fate may eventually catch up to strike\
  \ the decisive blow. While we are indulged in a mindless bickering over the Karachi\
  \ mayhem, the Panama claptrap and another round of maniacal dharnas, existential\
  \ threats loom large in the distance. Never mind Isis and others folks blowing stuff\
  \ up , by 2025 Pakistan is to become a \u2018water scarce\u2019 country, signalling\
  \ dire consequences for agriculture and an already alarming condition of food security.\
  \ And as icing on the cake, every year Pakistan adds the equivalent of one New Zealand\
  \ to its population, further strangling a fast depleting resource base.\nOn top\
  \ of that, an estimated 1.7 million job seekers enter the labour market annually,\
  \ which requires a highly improbable GDP growth rate of 7 percent to absorb the\
  \ influx of job seekers in the coming years. With Donald Trump running wild and\

  \      KARACHI: A group of former Olympians has expressed surprise over the silence\
  \ about various inquiries and audits which were being carried out by Pakistan Auditor\
  \ General and other departments to ascertain misuse of funds in PHF. They say it\
  \ is disappointing that there has been no progress since the appointment of new\
  \ president and secretary at PHF. They say why the findings of the audit and inquiries\
  \ are not being made public. The government had ordered an audit of PHF\u2019s expenditure\
  \ during the Pakistan People\u2019s Party tenure, but so far its final report has\
  \ not been made public. Sources said the audit report has been completed. The Punjab\
  \ NAB has also sent notices to the PHF previous management to appear before it.\
  \ The PHF\u2019s new officials are not taking much interest in the inquiries but\
  \ they also did not create any hurdle in the processes. The misuse of funds at PHF\
  \ was a common complaint as the players of national senior team and the management\
  \ did not get their salaries for more than a year. The sources said that they were\
  \ busy preparing the national junior team to qualify for Junior World Cup 2016 and\
  \ generating funds. The government has assured the new management that it will provide\
  \ funds for teams\u2019 preparations and sending them for international events.\
  \ The PHF wanted to activate its marketing department so that a handsome amount\
  \ of money through sponsorships can be generated. PHF is seeking a good marketing\
  \ consultant these days. The sources said that Pakistan junior team would depart\
  \ on October 7 for Malaysia. PHF would then pay attention to several other issues.\
  \ The PHF bosses wanted to launch its website on which the details of Pakistan\u2019\
  s hockey history and current programmes would be available. The PHF is also keen\
  \ to make a comprehensive domestic hockey calendar for coming years. It wants to\
  \ revive school hockey in all big cities of the country. The PHF\u2019s new management\
  \ has expressed surprise that more than a dozen synthetic turfs, including blue\
  \ turfs, have been laid across the country, even in some small cities of Punjab\
  \ and Sindh, but due to poor management not a single hockey event has been organised.\
  \ The PHF wants to use these facilities and organise maximum domestic events with\
  \ the help of district associations and local governments."

text: "Legal eye: Minds wide shut\nThere is no justification for what lawyers did\
  \ in Lahore this week. There are no principles at play here. It is hooliganism in\
  \ stark form. We\u2019ll get to the question of how we got here in a minute, which\
  \ is where both bar and bench are at fault. But on this incident in isolation there\
  \ are no two sides to blame. That many in our profession stand in support of fellow\
  \ lawyers demanding that their sense of entitlement to be above the law be vindicated\
  \ shows complete collapse of the distinction between right and wrong amongst professed\
  \ purveyors of rule of law.\nWhat happened in Lahore is an exposition of what ails\
  \ Pakistan, not just the legal fraternity. We are partisan and tribal as a people.\
  \ Our sense of loyalty is identity based. Our commitment to rule of law continues\
  \ as long as the law doesn\u2019t bind us. We are eager to instil reform in everyone\
  \ but ourselves. We will speak of principles so long as abiding by them is not inconvenient.\
  \ There is no space for debate and dissent. You are either with us unconditionally\
  \ or against us. In this all or nothing culture taking issue-based positions is\
  \ not an option.\nIf you are a lawyer, you must support your fellow lawyer. If you\
  \ are a judge, you must defend the brother judge. If you don\u2019t, you are a traitor\
  \ to the cause. And what is the cause? It is to stand by the group without consideration\
  \ of right and wrong. And, further, that no one should rock the boat by introducing\
  \ irresponsible ideas such as self-accountability or introspection. Within the legal\
  \ fraternity (judges included) there is no appetite or conversation about reform.\
  \ We are so used to our shambolic justice system that we are oblivious to how broken\
  \ it is.\nThe justice system is a system of patronage and spoils like our political\
  \ system. You want to become a judge not for the love of the job or the temperament\
  \ for it. Judgeship offers you a higher place in the echelons of power. Once you\
  \ are part of this elite club, you are all set. There are no more performance reviews.\
  \ There is no reckoning of how you behave in court. There is no accountability for\
  \ how you exercise your authority. And the dysfunctional state that vexes ordinary\
  \ Joes is at your beck and call. Judgeship comes with tremendous personal power.\n\
  But to make the most of it, you need to work with lawyers who stand on the other\
  \ side of the rostrum. The lawyers are one step below in the hierarchy but they\
  \ are no ordinary citizens either. Generally aware of their rights and with greater\
  \ ability to get the justice system to respond together with their organisation\
  \ as a group, black coats have significant nuisance value. But like all other organised\
  \ groups within the state with nuisance value, the ability to create nuisance cultivates\
  \ a sense of entitlement to be afforded preferential treatment.\nWithin our broken\
  \ justice system, lawyers and judges are two sides of the same coin. As they say,\
  \ familiarity breeds contempt. Lawyers are privy to abuse of judicial power and\
  \ are often partners in the process. The picture thus gets ugly when the bar and\
  \ bench get embroiled. What is the benefit of being elected an officeholder in the\
  \ bar (after a gruelling and expensive campaign) if you are not even going to be\
  \ afforded exceptional treatment? And then if judges get used to dealing bar officials\
  \ with a stick, imagine what they\u2019ll do to ordinary lawyers \u2013 so goes\
  \ the argument.\nThere are misbehaving judges that decent lawyers are weary of.\
  \ And there are misbehaving lawyers that decent judges are weary of. But whether\
  \ a judge is right or wrong, he wields the power of contempt as a weapon. Lawyers,\
  \ on the other hand, need to gang up and threaten to scuttle the judicial process\
  \ to defend against contempt proceedings. Why? In contempt proceedings, a judge\
  \ is a judge in his own cause. Unless you are willing to risk jail time \u2013 and\
  \ your career \u2013 the only viable option is to tender an unconditional apology\
  \ and be done with it.\nBut that is also tricky business. Once you place yourself\
  \ at the court\u2019s mercy, it is for the court to forgive you or punish you after\
  \ you have admitted your guilt. In face of contempt proceedings one is mostly counselled\
  \ to offer an apology whether or not the behaviour in question was contemptuous.\
  \ Jurisprudence under contempt law also shows how this law is seldom used to punish\
  \ obstruction of justice or uphold rule of law (the purpose of its existence), and\
  \ is mostly used to protect the shame of judges and circumscribe the freedom to\
  \ critique judicial actions.\nBut neither lack of fairness in contempt trials nor\
  \ abuse of contempt law by judges to scuttle legitimate criticism justifies what\
  \ lawyers did in Multan last month or in Lahore this week. The success of the lawyers\u2019\
  \ movement reinforced the message that coercion is rewarded. In that case, the object\
  \ was upholding constitutionalism and rule of law. Given the molestation of both\
  \ the constitution and judicial independence by a dictator gone berserk, many of\
  \ us acquiesced in questionable means adopted to pursue a worthy end. We were wrong\
  \ to that extent.\nThe success of the movement lionised those who believe that the\
  \ ends justify the means. The Iftikhar Chaudhry court harnessed street-happy lawyers\
  \ as foot soldiers in its tug of war with competing power elites. As they served\
  \ their purpose, lawyers were rewarded with perks: relief in courts, elevation to\
  \ judgeship etc. As a wily judge backed by popular opinion, Iftikhar Chaudhry was\
  \ able to control the bar and the bench. But in the process he nurtured and humoured\
  \ the genie that had come out of the bottle. A confrontation between the bar and\
  \ bench was only a matter of time.\nSo how do we deal with it? Not by re-enacting\
  \ the Iftikhar Chaudhry model that combined media-savvy judicial populism with unconditional\
  \ patronage of judges and appeasement of lawyers. Almost everyone is aware how moth-eaten\
  \ and unsustainable the justice system has become in its present non-performing\
  \ state, except perhaps its two pillars: the bar and the bench. But the bar and\
  \ the bench suffer from a conflict of interest. In order to fix things they will\
  \ have to change their ethos and practices, which are devoid of ethics and have\
  \ led to this morbid state.\nIn a way this bar-bench confrontation is a good thing.\
  \ It has put in plain sight the ugliness that the legal fraternity revels in. The\
  \ loutish behaviour of lawyers has forced many fence sitters to take a position.\
  \ Will the tools and instruments of our trade be reason, logic and dispassionate\
  \ application of the law or will they be strikes, coercion and violence to seek\
  \ indefensible entitlements? There is hope as many lawyers are speaking up against\
  \ the belligerence that is coming to define our profession. This is no time to allow\
  \ group loyalty to trump principle.\nNotwithstanding ailments that keep our justice\
  \ system dysfunctional, if there is one judge in recent times who has shown the\
  \ spunk, vision and leadership to opt for and pursue much needed institutional reform\
  \ (to the chagrin of status quo judges and lawyers alike) to salvage the court system,\
  \ it is LHC CJ Mansoor Ali Shah. In a polity that is defined by mediocrity and expediency\
  \ anyone forcing those around him to indulge in behavioural change attracts the\
  \ wrath of the pro-status quo system. Justice Shah is certainly fighting a fight\
  \ worth fighting.\nWhile one stands with the court in this particular incident where\
  \ many lawyers seem to have lost their moral compass, let us understand that the\
  \ reform of the bar is impossible without the reform of the bench. Charity begins\
  \ at home.\n\_\nEmail: [email\_protected]\nThe writer is a lawyer based in Islamabad.\n\

text: "Brave new world or the past revisited?\n                            If there's\
  \ a cross on which Pakistan has found itself frequently crucified, it is the one\
  \ carrying the legend 'strategic'. What follies have we not committed in the pursuit\
  \ of strategic goals? Even our present preoccupation with terrorism is a product\
  \ of our strategic labours in times past (hopefully, never to return).  So when\
  \ a fresh batch of graduates out of higher strategy school speak of a 'strategic\
  \ dialogue' with the United States -- our principal ally and, often, the cause of\
  \ our biggest headaches -- there is reason to be wary. We have been here before,\
  \ travelled down this route many times, our obsessive insecurity driving us time\
  \ and again into American arms, each time to be left high and dry when the initial\
  \ enthusiasm, or necessity, had passed. But we never seem to learn and each time\
  \ begin our quest for the holy grail -- of permanence in our American connection\
  \ -- as if there were never any heartbreaks before. Barely six months ago the US\
  \ viewed Pakistan through sceptical, even distrustful, eyes. The army had yet to\
  \ go into South Waziristan and the phrase Quetta Shura was on the lips of every\
  \ half-baked security analyst across the Atlantic. South Waziristan, the unspoken\
  \ acceptance of drone strikes and greater cooperation with the CIA in nabbing shadowy\
  \ Taliban figures in Pakistan changed all this. American faces now light up at the\
  \ mention of Pakistan, no smile more beaming than on the face of Gen David Petraeus.\
  \  As part of this mood swing, the Americans have taken to lionizing Pakistan's\
  \ army commander, Gen Ashfaq Kayani, who is very much the flavour of the moment,\
  \ just as -- frightening thought -- Pervez Musharraf was once upon a time. It is\
  \ sobering to remember that when Musharraf signed on with the US post-Sept 11, conceding\
  \ far more than anyone in the Bush administration was expecting, no leader on earth\
  \ was more feted than him.  So we should try and keep things in perspective. The\
  \ Americans may be gushing over us now but that's only because we are crucial, perhaps\
  \ indispensable, for the success of their mission in Afghanistan. Or even for a\
  \ face-saving exit from that quagmire. There are two fronts to this war, the one\
  \ in Pakistan being by far the most important.  The 'strategic dialogue' is thus\
  \ not pegged to any abstract love for Pakistan. It arises from the grim necessity\
  \ of the war in Afghanistan. We should be under no illusions about the window of\
  \ opportunity that this dialogue offers. This window will remain open and serviceable\
  \ only up to the moment when the Americans begin withdrawing from Afghanistan. To\
  \ assume otherwise, and give way to misplaced euphoria -- something at which we\
  \ are rather good -- is to court the ways of folly and set ourselves up for another\
  \ 'betrayal' at American hands.    The wish-list Pakistan has carried to Washington\
  \ has Kayani's thumbprint all over it. It has not been lost on anyone that in the\
  \ driving seat as far as our delegation is concerned sits not the foreign minister\
  \ or anyone else but him. It would also not have been lost on anyone that the brief\
  \ prepared by our side for the talks was put together not in the prime minister's\
  \ office or anywhere else but in General Headquarters, with key federal secretaries\
  \ in attendance and Kayani, not the prime minister, presiding. Kayani is a smart\
  \ man, very articulate and extremely good at putting his point of view across (his\
  \ presentation at Nato Hqs in Brussels has been widely talked about). But what is\
  \ this we are hearing about the shopping list prepared under his aegis? Which world\
  \ are we living in? Which planet does GHQ still inhabit? We have just a year and\
  \ a half, not eternity, to get what we want from the US. It behoves us ill to ask\
  \ the US to help restart our composite dialogue with India. If India is playing\
  \ hard-to-get on this count, we should be able to keep our cool and wait for India's\
  \ attitude to change. Even if the composite dialogue doesn't get going for the next\
  \ two years, the glaciers will not melt and the Himalayas will not march down to\
  \ the seas. We should be mature enough to understand a few things clearly. America\
  \ is not going to ask India to talk Kashmir with us. It is not going to solve our\
  \ water problems with India. It is not going to give us the kind of nuclear deal\
  \ it has concluded with India.  To go by the hype generated in official quarters,\
  \ it almost appeared as if we were expecting a string of nuclear power plants from\
  \ the US. And what happens? Hillary Clinton announces a gift of 125 million dollars\
  \ to set up thermal power plants. A colder splash of water on the fires of our misplaced\
  \ ardour could not have been poured. What Burke said of England in the context of\
  \ America's war of independence: \"Light lie the dust on the ashes of English pride\"\
  \ -- we can use to define our predicament: light lie the dust on the embers of our\
  \ strategic relationship.    Sooner or later we will have to discover the reasons\
  \ for this talent for selling ourselves cheap. We have always behaved thus in our\
  \ dealings with the US, assuming obligations unthinkingly, never asking for the\
  \ right price and then moaning about betrayal and the like when the Americans, taking\
  \ us at our word, leave us with very little.  Mobarak got Egypt's American debt\
  \ (7 billion dollars, and this was in 1991) written off when he joined America's\
  \ first Gulf war. The Turks asked for 25 billion dollars to allow American troops\
  \ territorial passage prior to the Iraq war in 2003. That the US refused is beside\
  \ the point. The Turks did not allow themselves to be taken for granted. We settle\
  \ for peanuts and call it a 'strategic relationship'.   Kayani, as I have said,\
  \ is a smart man. But there is too much of India and Afghanistan in his world-view.\
  \ More than with the US, we need to be conducting a strategic dialogue with ourselves.\
  \ Why can't we rid ourselves of the fixation of managing things in Afghanistan?\
  \ We can't manage ourselves, yet we want to fix the neighbourhood. Managing Afghanistan\
  \ may be a worthy ambition. But it is poor compensation for mismanaging Pakistan.\
  \ GHQ is aghast at the thought of the Indians training the Afghan army. In Kayani's\
  \ phrase, even when trainers depart, they leave their mindset behind. Given the\
  \ vehemence of our position on this point, maybe the Americans give us ground on\
  \ this. And we will hail it as a major victory. But we should be playing for higher\
  \ stakes instead of tilting at windmills. We should have been gunning for something\
  \ tangible. We are a debtor nation, strapped for cash. It is money we should have\
  \ been asking for. In concrete terms, a writing off of all our debt. A one-point\
  \ agenda, clearly stated and firmly put, without all the mumbo-jumbo of a 'strategic\
  \ relationship'. Water, energy, India and Afghanistan were best left out of our\
  \ wish list, more an exercise in fantasy than anything to do with the real world.\
  \    This government is too scatterbrained and too preoccupied with other problems\
  \ to have been able to get things right and concentrate on the essentials of this\
  \ 'strategic dialogue' right. The vacuum created by its ineptitude was filled by\
  \ a GHQ pluming itself on the laurels won in Swat and FATA. But for all its slickness\
  \ under Kayani, GHQ, alas, remains trapped in the morass of its old conceits and\
  \ prejudices. So the old questions remain: how to emerge from the darkness into\
  \ the light? How to manage Pakistan's affairs better? Most important of all: whence\
  \ will come the liberation of the Pakistani mind?  One thing is for sure: not from\
  \ GHQ. Afterthought: the army had denounced the Kerry-Lugar Bill. What's so great\
  \ about the 'strategic dialogue'?Email: [email\_protected]"

  \ to plant a sapling at his or her workplace and take care of the plant until it\
  \ becomes a fully grown tree, as without trees, nobody can even think of having\
  \ a clean and better environment in the country.Speaking at a ceremony on the occasion\
  \ of World Environment Day, he said the cutting of trees was a crime in many countries,\

  \ trees along canals and roads in the province.Citing the United Arab Emirates (UAE),\
  \ he said the emirates were spread over a vast desert, but their rulers and people\
  \ had planted millions of trees, which not only reduced the temperature in the country\
  \ but it also resulted in more rainfall. But in Pakistan, he deplored, trees were\
  \ being chopped down mercilessly.A delegation of the International Association of\
