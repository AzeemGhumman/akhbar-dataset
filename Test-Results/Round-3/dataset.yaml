heading: 'Reparable Russian rift or costly, counter-productive confrontation? '

text: ' Forgive the alliteration. But one of the most crucial issues for international
  security is the future of the rift between the West and Russia. Is this rift reparable?
  If the answer is yes, how might this be achieved? Or, is this confrontation a 21st
  century version of the past Cold War in which the inimical interests of the parties,
  as opposed to the competing ideologies of democracy and communism, make it impossible
  for any lasting arrangement to take hold for some time to come? If this is the case,
  what then might be a modus vivendi to prevent further deterioration of and miscalculation
  in the relationship as a temporary palliative? If no such framework exists or can
  be made to work, what then is Plan B? An objective assessment of how this standoff
  and conflict came to be requires both East and West and the U.S. and Russia to accept
  some of the blame. From Washington s perspective, the expansion of NATO posed no
  danger to Russia. Interventions into Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya were very much
  justified at the time. Moscow s warnings on NATO expansion and the interventions
  were not heeded. Nor did the American side see George W. Bush s promise of NATO
  membership for Georgia and Ukraine at the 2008 NATO Bucharest Summit as particularly
  threatening to Russia. President Vladimir Putin strongly disagreed and bluntly told
  Mr. Bush that if this offer stood, consequences would follow. Several months later,
  Putin baited a trap into which Georgia readily fell. The war was short and one-sided.
  The result was contested borders making Georgia ineligible for NATO membership.
  The cause celebre that solidified this rift was Moscow s intervention into Ukraine
  and the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. From the West s perception, Moscow
  had violated the  rules based order  of the post-Cold War and the sanctity of international
  borders. That Moscow continued to deny the presence of Russian troops in eastern
  Ukraine despite irrefutable evidence to the contrary convinced President Barack
  Obama that Putin s word could no longer be trusted. And Moscow s military intervention
  in Syria to save the regime of Bashar al Assad led to charges of war crimes over
  the brutal bombings of civilian targets including hospitals and humanitarian relief
  columns. Russian hacking of the Democratic Party s emails and  active measures  to
  interfere with the American 2016 elections were further strains on an already tense
  relationship. Moscow issued denials of any interference refuted by America s intelligence
  agencies who maintained possessing incontrovertible evidence of Russian hacking.
  That President Obama could tell President Putin  to knock it off  at the G-20 meeting
  last Fall did not enhance the relationship. Allegations of President Donald Trump
  s deeper involvement with Russia are now roiling American politics. However, members
  of his election team including son-in-law Jared Kushner and his two sons indeed
  had contacts with Russian sources raising troubling questions. The resignation of
  former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn for concealing conversations with
  Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak added to this controversy. And Attorney
  General Jeff Session s failure under oath to disclose meetings with Russian officials
  and in written answers to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have been high
  octane fuel for this smoldering tale now called  Tower-gate  over the president
  s unproven assertion that Obama ordered wiretapping of Mr. Trump.From Moscow s perspective,
  the United States could no longer be trusted to behave responsibly in international
  politics promiscuously applying military force that exacerbated already volatile
  conditions. Assaults into Afghanistan however justified and then Iraq over non-existent
  weapons of mass destruction have plunged the regions into chaos and created the
  Islamic State (IS). Libya was the last straw to Moscow as the killing of Muramar
  Qaddafi in 2011 has exploded into civil war. And the continued expansion of NATO
  to surround Russia was perceived as a direct threat to  containing  Russian ambitions.  Concurrently,
  while Moscow denies  active measures  to disrupt Western countries and interfere
  in domestic politics, Russia has taken a page from the American playbook. From the
  end of World War-II through the 1970 s the CIA actively interfered in supporting
  friendly regimes irrespective of adherence to democratic principles while attempting
  to topple unfriendly governments. These activities ranged from Greece and Italy
  in the late 1940 s to Africa, South America, Iran in 1953 with the overthrow of
  Mohammed Mossadegh and of course Vietnam. That Mr. Trump s administration appears
  ambivalent towards Russia is not a good sign. The president has gone out of his
  way to seem supportive of Mr. Putin. Yet, Nikki Haley, his ambassador to the UN,
  has reacted strongly against Russian aggression in Syria and Ukraine. And the Pentagon
  still considers Russia the number one danger as a potentially existential threat
  to America given its strategic nuclear arsenal. Hence, as Lenin famously asked,  what
  is to be done?  First, it is vital to identify any shared or common interests. Obviously
  avoiding war or unwanted crises is the top priority. Acting against international
  terror particularly the Islamic State (IS) is second. Third is adhering to current
  arms agreements or putting further limits on nuclear weapons numbers and possible
  proliferation. A distant fourth is reaching agreement on Syria and Ukraine that
  could lead to the lifting of sanctions against Russia. For any of these common interests
  to lead to reducing tensions, what is needed is dialogue. The standard heads of
  government summit is too short for a complete range of discussions. After Pearl
  Harbor, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill spent two weeks in the United States
  with President Franklin Roosevelt that produced the strategy for winning World War-II.
  No one is suggesting two weeks are needed for a Putin-Trump meeting. However, a
  carefully scripted and well-prepared agenda is essential. Part of this can be accomplished
  in prior military to military and diplomatic talks, currently forbidden by the National
  Defense Authorization Act in retaliation for Russian interventions in Ukraine and
  Syria. Despite Congress  understandable reaction, cutting off military contacts
  is not a smart way for determining how relations might be improved and crises avoided.
  This column has speculated that President Trump may have a grand bargain in mind
  for negotiations with Russia. Theoretically, provided the land mines and traps can
  be avoided, that approach could be helpful. If however it fails, a Plan B is needed.
  To work, a Plan B must be based on the realization that responding to 21st century
  challenges in the form of active measures and asymmetric, non-military tools cannot
  be effective using 20th century means. While deploying four battalions of troops
  to the Baltics and rotating a US Brigade Combat Team to Poland is reassuring to
  NATO allies, these augmented military forces have virtually no role in denying Russian
  active measures. As argued in last week s column, NATO needs a new strategy. But,
  as chaos and confusion reign in Washington, and Moscow obviously is playing a wait
  and see game, valuable time is being wasted. Perhaps cooler heads in the NSC, the
  State and Defense Departments will prevail and are thinking these issues through.
  For the benefit of all, let us hope that is being done.   The writer is UPI s Arnaud
  de Borchgrave Distinguished Columnist, a Senior Advisor at Washington D.C. s Atlantic
  Council and chairman of two private companies. His next book due out this year is

text: 'Asian investors on Thursday largely brushed off China s tit-for-tat response
  to Donald Trump s latest tariff threats, with most markets rising, but concerns
  about the impact of an all-out trade war are keeping optimism in check. Beijing
  said on Wednesday it would impose 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion of US goods
  from August 23, retaliating in kind to a warning from US officials the day before
  and escalating a crisis that pits the world s top two economies against each other.
  While the row has sent global markets into convulsions this year, the latest development
  had been widely expected, with Wall Street ending mixed. Hong Kong jumped 1.1 percent,
  extending a rally into a fourth day, while Shanghai surged 1.8 percent following
  healthy Chinese inflation data. Seoul was 0.1 percent higher, Sydney added 0.5 percent
  and Wellington rose 0.8 percent, while Bangkok gained 0.1 percent. However, Tokyo
  dropped 0.2 percent on a stronger yen. Manila was down 0.8 percent after data showed
  the Philippines economy massively undershot growth expectations in April-June, with
  the government citing the temporary closure of popular holiday island Boracay as
  a key reason. Pound struggles  Energy firms fell in line with a sharp sell-off in
  oil, which followed a report showing US stockpiles fell less that expected, while
  investors are also fretting over the effects of a China-US trade war on demand.
  Both main contracts plunged more than three percent on Wednesday, with analysts
  saying figures pointing to a drop in Chinese imports from the US were also detrimental.
  WTI and Brent were slightly higher Thursday.  Oil fell out of bed last night as
  worries over Chinese demand surfaced after the trade data yesterday and in the wake
  of China s hitting back in the tariff war targeting energy products,  said Greg
  McKenna, chief markets strategist at AxiTrader. On currency markets the ruble extended
  Wednesday s losses and is now down more than four percent against the dollar after
  Washington imposed fresh sanctions over Russia s involvement in the attempted killing
  of a former spy in Britain. And the pound also remains rooted near one-year lows
  on fears Britain will leave the European Union next year with no deal to trade with
  the bloc, with the country s trade secretary and central bank boss recently warning
  the chances of such a scenario are increasing.  The market is clearly getting more
  nervous over the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which would be a messy outcome
  for the UK economy,  said Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at
  National Australia Bank. In early trade London fell 0.5 percent, Paris shed 0.3
  percent and Frankfurt was off 0.1 percent. Key figures Tokyo   Nikkei 225: DOWN

text: 'From  Dil say Pakistan ,  Mr Fraudiye ,  Waderey Ka Beta  to  Miti Da Palwan  and  Aalu
  Andey , several musicians have a long history of incorporating protest and social
  issues into their songs. Music is a universal language that we all understand and
  that holds a great deal of power. Pakistani bands are increasingly becoming vocal
  about social issues. The influence is trickling down to the nation s youth. Plato
  defines music as  a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind,
  flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.  It was
  music that came to support the civil rights movement in America with an aim to put
  an end to social injustice. The echoing call for liberty, equality and freedom was
  heard all over the world, through the aid of guitars, saxophones and harmonicas.
  On average, people less than 18 years old spend more than six to seven hours per
  day interacting with or listening to media. Of the most commonly used methods to
  communicate information, listening to music stands out as an almost daily occurrence
  in the lives of young adults. One only needs to walk around for a few minutes on
  most college or university campuses to see numerous people listening to music through
  their phones and other devices. The experience of listening to music can potentially
  shape an individual s values, actions, and worldview. Singer Haroon says living
  in a country like Pakistan, so many social issues are staring at you in the face
  and you want to contribute to a positive change For the past few years, one of the
  famous singers of Pakistan Aaron Haroon Rashid has spoken about social issues through
  his music and productions. Over the years he has built up a huge fan following and
  his music videos are a treat for the viewers. He is the founder of Pakistani Pop
  Music Group  Awaz . He is an award winning British born Pakistani musician, singer,
  music producer, composer, director and social activist. He is the founder and CEO
  of Unicorn Black the Islamabad based animation production company. He is also the
  creator and director of the hugely successful and internationally acclaimed multi
  award winning Pakistani 3D animated TV series Burka Avenger and Teeto and Tania.
  While talking to Daily Times he said,  I realised early on in my music career that
  being a popular musicians meant you had this massive platform through the media
  to speak to millions. Living in a country like Pakistan so many social issues are
  staring at you in the face and you want to contribute to a positive change. I created
  songs like Mr. Fraudiay and Ay Jawan with Awaz and solo songs such as Dil Say Pakistan,
  Jiya Jaye, and Ghoom Ghoom, which touched upon social issues or sent out positive
  messages for the youth. Further with Burka Avenger and Teetoo and Tania I was following
  that same model of highlighting social issues, which we as nation are facing. Ideally
  I prefer the content whether it s music, video or animation that have a social message
  or some sort of deeper meaning. Directing, producing and launching Burka Avenger
  was quite an incredible experience for me. The show received worldwide press, international
  awards and accolades. The team at Unicorn Black and myself ended up producing 52
  episodes of Burka Avenger that were aired on multiple channels in Pakistan and around
  the world. Moreover,  Teetoo and Tania  is a thought-provoking concept for highlighting
  Pakistani heroes and role models for inspiring the youth of Pakistan. The show has
  produced and featured Edhi, Muniba Mazari, Mustaq Chappra, Dr Ruth Pfau, Aitzaz
  Ehsan and Ansar Burney in its animation cartoons and one can see them on YouTube
  or PTV. The songs or cartoons he produced all focus on making listeners aware of
  the incidence of social injustice that perpetuates in the society.  Haroon said
  producing Dil Say Pakistan was to pay tribute to national legends of Pakistan as
  the pin-hole camera flashes images of our revered personalities, starting from Abdul
  Sattar Edhi, followed by Malala Yousafzai and male and female cricket champions.
  The video also shows the images of the most beautiful landscapes of Pakistan s land.
  The original track is lovely song. The new version of Dil Say Pakistan received
  over 7 million views online and a lot of love from the fans and press, which made
  me quite emotional. On a question regarding a song which Haroon sang where he was
  shown in jail singing  Go Saab Jee , he replied that the idea behind the track and
  the video was to highlight corruption of the rich politicians in juxtaposition with
  the financial difficulties of the poor in Pakistan.The idea of the jail was that
  the common people have suffered a lot due to the instability and corruption in the
  country. That is why I sang from the jail, symbolising the situation and the condition
  of the common people and the country on a whole. It is like the political corrupt
  who should be in jail are running free and having a blast while the masses are held
  hostage to them, said Haroon. For the video of  Ghoom Ghoom , Haroon extended his
  creativity to a new platform, as a music video director. Speaking about directing
  the video, Haroon said he was initially inspired by the famous quote by Rumi:  I
  Searched for God among the Christians and on the cross, and therein I found Him
  not. I went into the ancient temples of idolatry; no trace of Him was there. I entered
  the mountain cave of Hira and then went very far, but God I found not. Then I directed
  my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young; God was not there. Finally,
  I looked into my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.  Haroon filmed
  the video in England and Pakistan, at 20 different locations, capturing mosques,
  shrines, cathedrals, and temples. These include a beautiful Sikh Gurdwara, London
  s famous St. Paul s Cathedral, Regent s Park mosque, and the breathtaking Baadshahi
  Mosque in Lahore, among many other locations. Adding on from Rumi, Haroon says he
  aims to share a larger message of his own with the viewers,  the underlying theme
  of the video is that people of all faiths are searching for God and peace and our
  ultimate desires are the same.  This is a time to reach out and help our fellow
  brothers and sisters who are suffering regardless of religion, ethnicity, or background,
  we must lend a hand, he said. By appealing to our emotions, issue based songs have
  the ability to break down complex issues into things we can all relate to like love,
  friendship, fear or loss. In this way, music expands our horizons and opens our
  minds to new ideas. Using music as a tool to build movement is one of the most important
  aspects for social change. I am looking for songs that will open people s eyes to
  the problems that exist in today s world. Issue based songs can often serve as inspiration
  for students to examine aspects of social justice such as accepting others, challenging
  discrimination, examining privilege, and rejecting violence. These initiatives by
  musicians are seriously appreciable. By doing social satire in their music may not
  bring vast or any revolutionary change in Pakistan s politics but it can make young
  minds think about the system and question the politicians. In doing so, these bands
  are nudging youth to form opinions of their own and be more proactive on pressing
  issues that need their urgent attention. The writer is a social and political activist

text: ' During the time I spent at the UN, I experienced two major international blocks
  divided on the issue of human rights, showing huge differences on how the world
  views its conduct based on its social and constitutional norms. This is with special
  reference to the moratorium on the death penalty, subject to fiery discussions these
  days. The major conflict is between the European block and the Asian block where
  some countries still award capital punishment and carry out their executions. Although
  the moratorium was passed in December 2007, it is not binding on the nations involved.
  Following it means that nations have cordial relations with each other in good will
  and are set on the same page yet, at the same time, there are remnants of resentment
  as not all nations signed the pact, mainly because of their religious and customary
  beliefs. For example, in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, opposition comes
  in the garb of religion whereas there are links of heroin smuggling by the monarchy
  but those caught smuggling (mainly from the third world) are executed to protect
  the names of the influential in the drug mafia. The moratorium on the death penalty
  was twice affirmed on December 18, 2007 in the UN General Assembly with 106 to 46
  votes and 54 absentations. On December 21, 2010, the resolution was again passed
  with 109 countries in favour of it with 41 against it and 35 absentations. Though
  there had been vigorous efforts since 1999, the real diplomatic endeavour was witnessed
  in 2007 when it finally took shape as a resolution. The moratorium was first introduced
  by Italy and was strongly supported by the EU and New Zealand. It was presented
  with the logic that death penalties were imposed to score political gains, to conceal
  the names of perpetrators belonging to influential and important personalities and
  also because that there is no scientific link between executions and curbing of
  crime. Pakistan signed the pact on December 18, 2007 after much deliberation and
  was synchronised with nations propagating a moratorium with the aim of complete
  abolishment of the death penalty in later stages. This helped Pakistan gain a little
  leverage on raising its human rights index, as there have been serious miscarriages
  of justice on account of its faulty laws that bring the onus on the accused and
  no accountability on the accuser for his/her allegations of the crimes that fall
  under the blasphemy laws and Hudood Ordinance, as witnessed in Aasia Bibi s case.
  Legislatively, the previous government of Pakistan, the PPP, tended to do better
  until 2012 when a soldier serving on death row was executed. The moratorium was
  officially lifted by the newly elected government of Nawaz Sharif following the
  horrendous attack on a school in Peshawar on December 16, 2015. This law will not
  make any difference, as militants have always been freed from courts of law for  lack
  of evidence . Scores of militants have been freed as a gesture of good will for
  talks with the Taliban. Instead, the lifting of the moratorium will cause serious
  repercussions on executing those who have been wrongfully accused. Whether there
  is a consensus on imposition of the moratorium or not, it goes in favour of Pakistan
  on both ethical and diplomatic grounds. Where there are cases of miscarriage of
  justice, taking the life of the wrongly accused cannot be undone, placing Pakistan
  in double jeopardy over its human rights record. There have been reports of judges
  getting death threats for awarding the death sentence. This lifting of the moratorium
  will not bring any change; rather, it will further victimise the helpless who have
  been wrongfully accused and sentenced to death. During one of my interviews with
  the locals of Swat, where the military operation took place against militants, many
  complained of their missing persons, amounting to almost 12,000 persons, or of their
  relatives unjustly convicted of terrorism when they were taken and recruited by
  force by the Taliban to fight with them at the cost of the lives of their families.
  Their main agitation was why the masterminds and the most wanted Taliban had not
  been pursued, caught, tried or released without any charge while the lower tier
  of the Taliban, forced to fight against their will at gunpoint, were being held
  as terrorists. The state of Pakistan remains silent over this issue and has done
  nothing so far. Nothing can be a graver sin than taking away the life of the innocent.
  No country can progress unless it amends its laws that can ensure the protection
  and acquittal of the wrongfully accused. Imposing the death sentence, as has been
  scientifically proven, does not help in curbing crime as it still exists despite
  punishments. The justice system should not be based on the principles of revenge;
  in fact, it should be so to avoid future crimes from occurring and settle disputes.
  The only way to curb crime is through a fundamental change in the system rather
  than putting the onus of it on an individual. What moral repercussions could the
  judiciary face for falsely sentencing death to the accused? Currently, there are
  about 8,000 inmates serving on death row. Though it might not be appropriate to
  state that all verdicts have been unjustified, there is a huge dilemma because of
  the debatable and loose laws of Pakistan, as we see in case of Aasia Bibi in which
  the onus of responsibility is on the accused to bring her defence, not on the prosecutor
  who may just orally claim blasphemy, even without producing any viable proof or
  by forging evidence, and walk away free.  Deterrence from crime in any society can
  only be brought about by checks and balances, monitoring and vigilant law and order.
  Such, unfortunately, is not in place in Pakistan but this should not mean that the
  death penalty should be used as a justification for lack of proper legal facilitation.
  Life is a gift of God and sending someone to the gallows, who has committed no crime,
  is a crime in itself.   The writer is a freelance columnist and may be contacted

text: 'Though the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has managed to secure a victory in
  Karachi by securing 14 out of 21 seats. However, it has only managed to do so in
  constituencies where voter turnout was lowest. This happened in an election where
  voter turnout in Pakistan s biggest metropolis was also lower than expected. Though
  55 percent of Karachi s voters participated the 2013 general elections, turnout
  was only 40 percent in 2018. It is not clear what prompted Karachiites to stay home
  on July 25, though terrorist violence in other parts of the country and allegations
  of pre-poll rigging by commentators and opinion makers cannot be counted out as
  factors. What stands out most is an easily discernible pattern. PTI has performed
  the best in areas where voter turnout was lowest, while the Pakistan People s Party
  (PPP) came out on top in constituencies with higher voter turnout. Three PTI candidates
  obtained less than 10 percent of the registered votes. This included NA-249 s Muhammad
  Faisal Vawda who defeated Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shahbaz
  Sharif. Among all PTI candidates, it was the PTI Chief who secured most votes. He
  obtained 22.74 percent of votes in NA-243, where he won with 91,358 votes. Turnout
  in this constituency was 41.1 percent. Also read: Purana  Pakistan repackaged? However,
  in NA-236 where turnout was highest at 50.4 percent, it was PPP s Jam Abdul Karim

  s constituencies. On top of this, women s voter turnout was also abysmal. Less than
  30 percent of women voters came to polling stations in three constituencies. Low
  turnout combined with the discovery of dumped ballot boxes and papers marked with
  votes for the PPP, PML-N and Muttahida Qaumi Movement near the Qayyumabad area have
  raised questions about the PTI s victory in Karachi. The Election Commission of
  Pakistan and other relevant authorities must get to the bottom of why Karachiites,
  especially PPP supporters and women, were not able to cast their votes on Election
  Day. So far it seems, Pakistani democracy remains a work in progress.  * Published

text: ' There is plenty of compulsive chatter about how the fate changing China-Pakistan
  Economic Corridor (CPEC) promises to be. That the mills will yarn once again, the
  cattle will be fragrant with fresh milk and the poor shall have their fortunes revived
  permanently. However, hold your horses, we are not out of the woods yet. Sharifs  have
  picked up a knack of talking themselves out of an economic mishmash. Truth be told,
  Pakistan s economic prospects at least for the immediate future remain fitfully
  shaky. Growth, for most part of Pakistan s history has been infested by several
  missed opportunities. There are although plentiful reasons to lose one s calm, but
  chief amongst them include a widening current account deficit and rapidly drying
  up foreign remittance inflows. As Sharifs  go about riding the CPEC tide, a few
  bloomers on our macroeconomic front deserve a narrative: imports have been steadily
  rising and now approaching a near $50 billion mark. Sadly, exports are in a receding
  mode, declining from $25 billion in 2012 to a current $20 billion. That leaves us
  with a brain   busting $30 billion of current account deficit, far exceeding our
  present export earnings. Another reason to fluster about is a gradual drop in foreign
  remittance income. Pakistan s erratic macroeconomic state does not entirely borrow
  its behavior from its domestic policy frameworks. Being a fairly liberalised economy,
  its external environment is an equally noteworthy determinant of local macroeconomic
  performance. Incessant trade deficits over successive decades have not only weakened
  the rupee, but have also eroded domestic economic prospects. In a low savings economy
  such as that, choked by other structural impediments, foreign remittance inflows
  have played the role of a shock absorber. A traditional buffer that is usually greater
  than the aggregate sum of total external development assistance and even foreign
  direct investment. Since the New York twin towers ravaging of 9/11, these remittances
  have witnessed a steady increase, a major portion of which is extracted from the
  resource loaded gulf nations. Dismally, and owing to depressed global commodity
  prices, budgets of all major oil exporting kingdoms are sorely impaired, dampening
  the demand for cheap labor supply coming from Pakistan. As a result, since late
  last year, Pakistan has lost close to $200 million of such earnings, and, extended
  periods of poor remittance inrushforebode a serious macroeconomic distortion. Give
  Pakistan s fragile macroeconomic fundamentals, uncomfortable inflationary tendencies,
  mounting twin deficits, dwindling foreign exchange reserves and scanty domestic
  savings, the remittance income came as a refreshing insurance against, not only
  a bungled-up currency but also poor grass root credit constraints. A little fudging
  of the macroeconomic statistics, courtesy some Chinese loans cannot be misconstrued
  as an economic uplift. Sustained macroeconomic development after all, depends on
  how many people are pulled out from the breadline condition. According to the most
  updated United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) scoop, close to thirty percent
  of Pakistan s population is on the breadline. This implies that a large section
  of the population is sorely undernourished and therefore have little access to other
  essential needs like clothing, shelter, education, health and sanitation. Grass
  root livelihood following the 2010 devastation caused by the floods and the unceasing
  conflict in the frontier region of the country, has been in tatters. As most emerging
  economies round the globe are increasingly turning inwards, investing heavily on
  shoring up its human and physical capital, Pakistan must toe the line. As remittance
  inpourings continue to dry, and more overseas Pakistanis uproot themselves from
  a better living abroad, the government must examine its alternatives to fetch the
  greenback and keep its reserves from dipping further. Pakistan s growth however,
  expanded by 4.7 percent in the last financial year, a gain of 18 percent over 2015.
  But GDP numbers can always be convoluted and obscure. CPEC and the accompanying
  Chinese floaters may be a wonderful thing if utilised sanely but do not ensure that
  the nation s vault is in fine feather. We are clearly not out of the woods yet.
  This reminds me of an opening extract from Charles Dicken s A Tale of Two Cities:  It
  was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  Uncertainty looms large. The
  Sharifs must ensure that Pakistan does not scamper back to the International Monetary
  Fund (IMF) sweeteners at the end of another dodgy tenure.   The writer is an alumnus

text: ' Pakistan is facing political violence, terrorism, a hike in crime and terrible
  bloodshed. A lot of people harbour resentment against the state for its failure
  to protect the rights of its people. Some have labelled Pakistan a  failed state
  . The Global Peace Index ranked Pakistan at second position on its terrorism list
  after Iraq. Terrorism is increasing day by day and the state, to date, has failed
  to take any step to counter terrorism and protect its citizens. The political elite,
  instead of providing free health, education and fundamental rights to its citizens,
  indulge in controversies over whether unmanned robotic strikes in the territories
  of Pakistan undermine the sovereignty of Pakistan or not. The debate on drone strikes,
  I believe, is only to gather political opposition against the US and CIA   nothing
  more than that. The second issue to have gathered media attention is whether the
  trial of the ex-president   Musharraf   can be conducted for abrogating the constitution.
  It is not unreasonable here to say that the state has provided space to fundamentalists
  and extremists to be nurtured and get hold of its sovereignty. I feel the officials
  should actually consider whether there is a need to re-establish the state s  social
  contract  with the people and protect their human rights. In a discussion article,
  I shall be dwelling with the theory concerning the social contract. In the following
  paragraphs, discussion concerning this social contract from different perspectives
  will be brought to light. At first glance, it is reasonable to understand what social
  contract theory actually is. The social contract theory was first introduced in
  the 17th century and social contract theorists refined their ideas in the early
  18th century. John Locke, Thomas Hobbes and Rousseau are among those theorists who
  actually introduced their different ideas on the social contract. The Lockian theory
  of the social contract is much clearer and appreciated in the world than that of
  Hobbes and Rousseau. In political theory, the social contract addresses the question
  of the legitimacy of a state over its individuals. Like I have mentioned above,
  Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau all had different ideas but the basic idea of the social
  contract is that individuals relinquish some of their freedoms and subject themselves
  to the rule of law in exchange for protection. Thus, under this concept, the state
  s legitimacy largely depends on its success in protecting and safeguarding the lives
  of its people. Patriots are irked when the state of Pakistan appears under the  failed
  states  ranking but the state undermines or threatens its legitimacy when it fails
  to respect its commitments under the social contract. It is fair to say that the
  state of Pakistan becomes a conglomerate of its individuals taking matters into
  their hands. From addressing the electricity shortage through candles, generators
  and UPS systems, and meeting security through personal guards, all show a great
  deficit on the part of the state. It is worthwhile to mention that Pakistan is a
  place where the rich can create their own mini-states to protect themselves and
  fulfil their needs while the poor people are left to the state, which does not have
  the power or resources to manage and provide protection to its poor population.
  The state has totally failed to fulfil the fundamental needs of its citizens. The
  government s voice is for addressing the challenges of good governance and delivery
  of justice to all its citizens no matter the caste, creed and breed but, in reality,
  is only limited to conferences and dusty papers. To understand and find out how
  effective these conferences and policies made by the government are, one should
  ask the ordinary people on the street. How can the state reclaim its legitimacy?
  By better planning and systematically addressing its problems. Better planning can
  be possible if the state prioritises the issues by allowing individuals to participate
  in decision making. While enacting laws, parliament should take the general public
  into confidence. The political parties can also play an effective role because political
  parties can easily change the opinion of the general public. The Economic Survey
  of Pakistan, released earlier this summer, chose to keep the financial losses from
  terrorism classified. However, for Pakistanis to own their own war against terrorism,
  it is incumbent upon the government to help them be clear about this and help create
  a counter-narrative. Moreover, the government will need domestic confidence building
  measures for its citizens to regain the people s trust. Better communication, transparency
  and accountability in governance processes will allow the people to understand them,
  and subsequently participate more. A positive move in this regard is the accessibility
  of elected officials. Political parties should also be more active on social media,
  allowing for more communication between citizens and their political representatives.
  Lastly, and most importantly, Pakistanis, as a nation, will have to cooperate with
  their government and give constant feedback to help improve the governance processes.
  Creating grassroots accountability and meeting their own responsibilities   whether
  through keeping the roads clean or paying bills on time or just being honest in
  their day to day lives   will go a long way in improving the overall state of affairs
  in the country.  Every citizen in Pakistan deserves the right to life, and to not
  live in conditions of constant fear and insecurity. It is about time that the government
  and people rebuild their social contract.   The writer is an advocate of the High

text: 'Around 200 drug users escaped from a rehab centre in Vietnam on Saturday, police
  said, the latest breakout attempt from the country s controversial treatment facilities.
  Some addicts are forced by law to spend up to two years in Vietnam s rehab centers,
  while others are admitted by family or check themselves in. Most detainees undergo
  cold-turkey treatment in the notoriously overcrowded centres or are subjected to
  solitary confinement for breaking rules. Several breakouts have occurred in recent
  years and the most recent started on Saturday morning in the southern province of
  Tien Giang, a police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that about
  half the escapees had already been captured.  There are around 100 addicts still
  on the run and the police are still looking for them,  the officer said. A disagreement
  with staff escalated into an assault, with patients wielding knives and bricks and
  encouraging others to break down the door, state-controlled website VnExpress reported.
  Images circulating on social media showed dozens of men, many shirtless, wandering
  on a highway near the rehab centre.  They passed my area holding canes and shouted
  like protesters. When we saw them, me and people around were scared and worried,  local
  resident Le Hai Trieu told AFP. Residents pitched in to help local authorities capture
  the men. Another state media outlet said that more than 650 people are registered
  at the Tien Giang facility, but it did not provide figures on the number of voluntary
  admissions. There are more than 220,000 registered drug addicts in Vietnam, according
  to official statistics released last year, with heroin and methamphetamine the most
  popular narcotics.  While Vietnam is experimenting with more community-based treatment
  options in response to criticism over the centres, they remain the most-used form
  of recovery. The centres are widely supported as a viable treatment option although
  addiction specialists say they don t work and relapse rates are high. Early last
  year 100 people escaped from a centre in southern Long An province because they
  were upset about spending the annual Tet new year holiday away from their homes.

- Commentary / Insight
text: 'An objective study of world history impresses upon us a perennial lesson about
  why we find ourselves plunged into war time and again, repeating some of the mistakes
  made by the early superpowers. The lesson, I think, is this: the latter failed to
  understand   let alone uphold   the basic features of humanity. This is something
  that German philosopher Immanuel Kant called Unsocial Sociability; and it is, he
  believed, sine qua non for a peaceful international order. Unsocial Sociability
  may be defined as:  the tendency to come together in society, coupled, however,
  with a continual resistance which constantly threatens to break this society up
  . Simply put, this implies that states should be striving to strike a balance between
  the human instinct to socialise for collective ends while simultaneously resisting
  one and another when this serves particular concerns. Whereas, in actuality, nations   especially
  superpowers   single-mindedly pursue their vested interests. During such periods,
  the natural order becomes disturbed, paving the way for war. This question is once
  again relevant today. No more so than with Donald Trump at the US helm. In the post-Cold
  War period, the US took a prominent role in deciding a New World Order that would
  be peaceful under its leadership. Yet a quick glance over the two decades since
  the fall of the Soviet Union would suggest that the world is, in fact, becoming
  more insecure with each passing year; and that it is US authority that poses the
  most serious threat to Kant s concept of Unsocial Sociability. Let us fast-forward
  a bit to look at the American incursions into Afghanistan and Iraq. Regarding the
  former, the mission was to hunt down the 9/11 perpetrators. As for the latter, the
  objective was to overthrow the authoritarian regime of Saddam Hussein and replace
  it with a democratic regime that would give the US unfettered access to its oil.
  Thus the manufactured premise for war was based on allegations of WMDs. Both military
  adventures were undertaken solely to pursue American regional goals. Yet so poorly
  executed were they that the backlash has been immense. This has taken the form of
  terrorist outfits that have seemingly appeared in every corner of the globe. The
  US attempt to wipe out terrorism by way of its flawed policies in both Kabul and
  Baghdad have resulted in a world confronting the worst form of instability in the
  former and a ruthless brand of terror outfits in the latter, in the shape of the
  Islamic State. The US nexus between flushing out terrorism and targeting nation
  states has prompted the current nuclear crises in both Pyongyang and Tehran. These
  are ominous developments that indicate cracks have begun to appear in the US vision
  of a post-Cold War new world order Nevertheless, it is not only within this context
  that Washington has made the whole world insecure. It is the nexus between flushing
  out terrorism and targeting nation states that has prompted some to strive for nuclear
  capability, whether by hook or by crook. Such is the case with both North Korea
  and Iran, neither of which trusts this new American world order. Failure to ensure
  the protection of safeguards under the Treaty on Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
  (NPT) represents another indelible black mark against the US record. Besides the
  Trump administration has eroded what little successes that the Obama presidency
  had secured, through diplomacy and negotiation, in terms of curbing Iranian nuclear
  ambitions. Whereas, North Korea, for its part, has accelerated its weapons programme
  like never before. These are ominous developments and indicate that cracks have
  begun to appear in the US vision of a new world order. The US has also proved its
  colossal failings on the economic development front, namely in its drastically weakened
  commitment to combating global warming. Its recent withdrawal from the Paris Agreement
  on Climate Change coincided with President Trump terming global warming a Chinese
  hoax. This speaks volumes about the way in which Washington poses a threat to the
  natural balance of a peaceful world order by way of its adherence to Unsocial Sociability.  And
  then there is its unilateral approach to pressing global world issues, most of which
  have been of America s own making. This has seen a fraying of ties with Europe,
  which for the moment is being stewarded by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel.
  The EU, for all intents and purposes, appears a major US partner. Yet since the
  end of the Cold War and the removal of the Soviet threat   the two blocs, in reality,
  have experienced a certain cooling of alliances. Indeed, Brussels now enjoys good
  relations with both Moscow and Tehran; at a time when Washington does not. Moreover,
  President Trump did his country no favours when he called upon European states to
  contribute more to the NATO defence budget. Thus, given all the above, we may conclude
  that the US is following in the footsteps of previous superpowers; footsteps that
  ultimately led the world to war. History teaches us that states, particularly superpowers,
  enjoy their stint at the top as long as they secure the dynamics of Unsocial Sociability
  at the global level. Once states start edging away from this   they find that their
  days are numbered. Thus the priority then becomes new avenues for war; a power matrix
  among states in their quest for superpower status, regardless of the destruction
  this brings with it. The burning question remains: will the US under a Trump presidency
  continue to hurtle along the path towards Unsocial Sociability?   The writer is

  \ of it is seen as a shocking breach of tradition.\"Who will marry a woman who indulges\
  \ in love poetry?\" said Nadia, quoting her mother who forbade her from joining\

  \ old, these remarkable folk poems provide outsiders a means to explore the inner\
  \ world of a culture that can be hard to access.\"Nearly 15 years since the Taliban\
  \ regime was ousted from power in a United States-led invasion, Afghanistan has\
  \ witnessed a sea of change in women's rights, with female lawmakers and even pilots\
  \ now commonplace. But gender parity remains a distant dream amid pervasive conservative\
  \ attitudes that still deride women as \"Naqis-ul-aqal\" (having a weaker intellect\
  \ than men) and deem that a female voice should be forbidden in public spaces.\"\
  Morality protectors in Afghan society believe that male honour can be protected\
  \ only by locking away women where nobody can see or hear them,\" said poet and\
  \ writer Waheed Warasta. \"Women who dare to step out to recite poetry do so at\
  \ the risk of being labelled as prostitutes.\"In 2010, a teenage poet known by her\
  \ nickname Zarmina set herself on fire after a violent altercation with her brothers\
  \ who caught her reading a love poem over the phone and presumed there was a boy\
  \ on the other end of the line.A resident of Gereshk district in the Taliban insurgency-wracked\
  \ province of Helmand, Zarmina was a regular caller to Mirman Baheer's poetry helpline\
  \ and later died of her burns in hospital.\"We live in a country where people get\

  \ club's weekly gatherings in Kabul are held openly and attract elite university\
  \ professors, lawmakers and journalists, but its meetings in conservative areas\
  \ such as Kandahar and Helmand are held under a tight veil of secrecy. Mobile phones\
  \ can provide a lifeline. Arzo said some rural women who have no freedom to step\
  \ out of their homes break down over the phone, their poems giving vent to a torrent\
  \ of anguish. \"Landays reflect their struggles and work like an antidote to heartbreak,\"\
  \ Arzo said. One caller, who calls in regularly, left this landay: \"When my husband\
  \ took a second wife, I burned. I no longer care about the flames of hell.\" Another\
  \ bemoaned the stoning of a young woman accused of adultery. \"For whose sin am\
  \ I sacrificed to tradition. My biggest crime is that I am a woman.\" And one caller\
  \ from Khost province bordering Pakistan was unabashedly bold, her landay laced\
  \ with contempt for the prevalent machismo culture. \"You demand a kiss by force.\
  \ Night will give way to dawn, but you shall not have my lips.\" For many, going\
  \ out of their homes to buy mobile phone credit is akin to traversing a minefield.They\
  \ are fearful of getting caught and some call from a different number every time.\
  \ And it usually ends with a familiar pattern: after a while, the calls abruptly\
  \ stop, Arzo said. \"This sudden silence can only mean two things: either the poet\
  \ has been killed or married off.\""

text: "WASHINGTON, Nov 6: Republicans on Wednesday accused Democrats of trying to\
  \ use a US congressional probe of pre-war intelligence on Iraq to wage a political\
  \ attack against President George Bush.The basis for their accusation was a Democratic\
  \ staff memo that suggested Democrats seek an independent inquiry when cooperation\
  \ with the majority Republicans was exhausted, preferably next year.\u201CThe (Democratic)\
  \ memo completely shreds Democrats\u2019 claims of bipartisanship in this investigation\
  \ and falsely attributes ugly motives to the president, members of his administration\
  \ and fellow members of Congress,\u201D declared Sen Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican.In\
  \ often fiery exchanges with Democrats in the Senate, Republicans called for an\
  \ investigation and said staff responsible for the memo should be fired.Democrats\
  \ shot back that Republicans had mischaracterized the \u201Cunofficial\u201D memo\
  \ that they said no lawmaker had approved.They also said Congress should be more\
  \ concerned about the failure of the Senate Intelligence Committee to conduct a\
  \ thorough investigation into the intelligence leading up to the US invasion of\
  \ Iraq.\u201CThis body should be disturbed that ... months after we started asking\
  \ questions, we are still going, in essence, hat in hand to the administration to\
  \ try to get the documents we need,\u201D said Sen. John Rockefeller of West Virginia,\
  \ top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.The memo was drafted by the committee\u2019\
  s Democratic staff and first reported by Fox News on Tuesday.Critics have suggested\
  \ Bush may have exaggerated the threat from Iraq\u2019s suspected weapons of mass\
  \ destruction to build support for war.Republicans want to keep the committee probe\
  \ focused on the accuracy of assessments by US intelligence agencies. Democrats\
  \ want to broaden the inquiry to include how the Republican White House used the\
  \ information.According to the memo obtained by Fox, the Democratic staff wrote,\
  \ in part: \u201CWe have an important role to play in revealing the misleading \u2014\
  \ if not flagrantly dishonest methods and motives \u2014 of the senior administration\
  \ officials who made the case for a unilateral, pre-emptive war.\u201D\u201CWe can\
  \ pull the trigger on an independent investigation at any time \u2014 but we can\
  \ only do so once. The best time to do so will probably be next year,\u201D the\
  \ memo said.Intelligence Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, denounced\
  \ the memo and asked Democrats to do the same.Mr Roberts said Democrats and Republicans\
  \ should work together \u201Cto complete the business of the committee\u201D with\
  \ their investigation.Mr Roberts and Mr Rockefeller last week wrote the White House,\
  \ CIA, Pentagon and State Department demanding that documents be delivered and interviews\
  \ with officials be scheduled by a noon deadline last Friday.Roberts has said that\
  \ the White House had promised cooperation, but Mr Rockefeller said on Wednesday\
  \ they were still awaiting documents.Mr Kyl said the Senate should examine if its\
  \ own rules were violated, noting \u201Ccommittee staff should never be involved\
  \ in partisan political scheming\u201D.Mr Rockefeller said the Senate should examine\
  \ the matter since it raises a number of questions, such as who decided to leak\
  \ the memo and if the panel\u2019s \u201Cmajority is obtaining unauthorized access\
  \ to private internal materials of the minority\u201D.\u2014Reuters"

text: "LARKANA, Nov 2: The leader of the opposition in the Sindh Assembly, Nisar Ahmad\
  \ Khuhro, has criticized the appointment of nine additional judges in the Sindh\
  \ High Court. Talking to Dawn at his residence here on Wednesday, he regretted that\
  \ only two of the appointed judges were Sindhi.He claimed that the advocates who\
  \ had been made judges did not meet the criteria of at least 50 cases reported in\
  \ Pakistan Legal Decision publications. He added that the two Sindhi judges were\
  \ senior and their period of stay in the bench would be shorter.Mr Khuhro said that\
  \ earlier, according to his information, appointment of six non-Sindhi and five\
  \ Sindhi judges had been recommended but instead of striking a balance, the president\
  \ appointed more non-Sindhi judges.About the law and order situation in Karachi,\
  \ the PPP leader said it was alarming that between Oct 8 and Oct 31, eight workers\
  \ of the Sunni Tehrik were killed in Karachi. He said even Sunni Tehrik workers\
  \ who were collecting relief goods for earthquake victims were killed at their camps.He\
  \ criticized the Sindh government for its failure to maintain law and order in Karachi\
  \ and called for ensuring peace in the city.Referring to Muttahida Qaumi Movement\
  \ chief Altaf Hussain\u2019s statement calling for peace, Mr Khuhro said he should\
  \ look into reasons why peace was not prevailing in Karachi.Answering a question,\
  \ he said the Sindh government had lost credibility which was evident from what\
  \ he called fresh signs of mistrust between the Sindh governor and the chief minister\
  \ over the language issue.He said it looked strange that the chief minister being\
  \ the chief executive of the province was bypassed while issuing a notification\
  \ about the Sindhi language by the ministry of education.He said the disharmony\
  \ between the governor and the chief minister over the Sindhi language bill was\
  \ also evident from the fact that the Sindh home minister had opted not to attend\
  \ a Sindh Assembly session to evade questions about the issue.He said the treasury\
  \ benches were wasting time during sessions.About the preparedness of the PPP for\
  \ the forthcoming general election, he said his party was fully prepared to contest\
  \ the polls and prove that despite odds it was the only popular political party\
  \ of the country.Replying to a question, he said there was no room in the PPP for\
  \ traitors and turncoats who had betrayed the party in the recent local body election."

  \ conversion of the New Majestic cinema and demolition of the house of petitioner\

  \ comments of the military estate officer (MEO), a copy of which was provided to\
  \ petitioner\u2019s counsel, Jagdish R. Mulani. The MEO in his comments denied most\
  \ claims made in the petition, saying that the property number 43 (cinema building),\
  \ measuring 0.68 acres was for commercial purpose. M/s Agha Rafiq Ahmed and others,\
  \ through a letter dated Feb 15, 2004, had applied for conversion of the property\u2019\
  s 0.61 acres to regular lease for commercial purpose, he said, adding that the property\
  \ was purchased by M/s Mohammad Arif Memon and others in 2007 through a sale deed\
  \ and in 2013, they submitted building plans with the Cantonment Board Hyderabad\
  \ (CBH). The MEO submitted in court that the CBH forwarded the plans to the building\

  \ the proposed plan. The MEO stated that petitioner Ghulam Mohammad had encroached\
  \ upon the land adjacent to the cinema building and filed a civil suit in 2014.\
  \ After serving of notices to him under relevant law, the local army authorities\
  \ got the encroached land and the property was converted as per the old grant cantonment\
  \ code policy.He said that their suit against M/s Arif Builders and Developers was\
  \ dismissed as withdrawn. He explained that 0.68 acres of the plot number 43 pertained\
  \ to the old grant terms and lease under schedule VI of Rules 1937 for commercial\
  \ purpose of cinema, and an area measuring 0.61 acres was converted by government\
  \ to general commercial. Therefore, the petitioner\u2019s claim that it was a heritage\
  \ stood baseless, the MEO stated.He prayed to the court that the petition should\
  \ be dismissed. The petitioner has prayed to the court to declare the conversion\
  \ of the status of \u2018cinema building\u2019 to \u2018commercial purpose\u2019\
  \ illegal. He stated that the proposed plaza was located adjacent to the wall of\

text: 'DUBAI: Carrying forward the momentum of previous season, the defending champions
  Islamabad United kicked off the campaign of their title defense with an encouraging
  win of 7 wickets against the star-studded team Peshawar Zalmi. Islamabad, who won
  the five consecutive matches last season on way to win the title, reached the revised
  target of 173 runs in 18 overs with two balls to spare, thanks to the team s foreigners
  trio of Shane Watson, Brad Haddin and Dwayne Smith. Led by Pakistan s Test captain
  Misbah ul Haq, Islamabad United remained defiant in the match and never lost the
  hope despite heroic innings of 48-ball-88 by Kamran Akmal and restricted Peshawar
  from scoring more runs as Sammy s team was once looking comfortable and was predicted
  to be scoring over 200 runs. But, Watson s aggressive bowling, supported by Mohammad
  Sami s disciplined performance towards end gave a clear message that Islamabad s
  bowling would not get panicked even if you smash them all over the ground. Islamabad
  showcased their do-not-lose-hope strategy in batting too when they lost the opener
  Sharjeel Khan in the second over with only 14 runs on the board. Sharjeel could
  score only one run. But, after Sharjeel s departure, Smith and Haddin took the charge
  and provided Islamabad United a solid base to sail towards the target comfortably,
  which was later anchored by Shane Watson with his quick-fire 26. This do-not-lose-hope
  strategy is not new for Islamabad United team, it was also reflected in the team
  s campaign in the first season when they were outperformed in initial matches, but
  yet they came back and came back hardly to win the title in 2016. Surely, guidance
  of Wasim Akram, the one-and-only  Bhai of Cricket  as Islamabad United refer to
  him, has helped the IU team keep this approach, but the captain cool Misbah ul Haq
  also deserves the credit for keeping the calmness even in tensed situation of the
  game which allows him to take wise decisions. With the calm approach of do-not-lose-hope,
  the Islamabad United team  with a remarkable win in the opening match   has given
  a clear message to the opponents that this team is not going to accept the defeat
  unless they are finally defeated. So, don t be complacent while playing against
  Islamabad, even if you have a big total on board to defend. '

  the United States. Decades of health warnings have boosted public awareness that
  the addictive habit can cause lung and many other cancers, resulting in a declining
  number of smokers, experts say. However, large disparities remain, with people living
  in rural areas still far more likely to smoke than city-dwellers, said the latest
  CDC report. Just 11 per cent of adults in a metro area of one million people or

  outside city centers also "had the highest rates of being obese, having experienced

text: 'Heat waves can sap productivity by slowing down thinking, even in the young
  and healthy, a small study suggests. Harvard researchers found that during a summer
  heat wave, students living in dorms without air conditioning consistently scored
  lower on daily cognitive tests over the course of nearly a week than students in
  buildings with AC.  For the first time, we ve been able to find a detrimental effect
  of heat waves in young healthy adults,  said lead author Jose Guillermo Cedeno Laurent,
  a research fellow and associate director of the Healthy Buildings Program at the
  Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.  Among that group (who had
  no AC) there were longer reaction times and lower accuracy compared to an identical
  group of students who lived with air conditioning,  he told Reuters Health in an
  email. The researchers followed 44 undergraduate and graduate students in their
  late teens and early 20s for 12 consecutive days during July of 2016. Twenty-four
  of the students resided in buildings constructed in the 1990s that were equipped
  with central air conditioning, while 20 lived in Neo-Georgian-style low-rise brick
  buildings built between 1930 and 1950 with no cooling system. The researchers designed
  their experiment so that the 12 days included a five-day heat wave, preceded by
  five days with more moderate temperatures, and followed by two days of cooler weather.
  Temperatures inside the building without air conditioning averaged 26.3 degrees
  Celsius (79.3 degrees Fahrenheit) and ranged as high as 30.4 degrees C (86.7 F).
  Average temperatures in the air-conditioned buildings were 21.4 degrees C (70.5
  F), ranging up to 25 degrees C (77 F). Each morning the students took two tests
  of cognition on their smartphones. One test, which required students to correctly
  identify the colour of displayed words, measured their reaction speed and ability
  to concentrate and block out distractions. The other test, which presented basic
  arithmetic problems, measured mental quickness and working memory. During the heat
  wave, students in buildings with no cooling had 13.4 per cent slower reaction times
  on the colour-word tests and 13.3 per cent lower scores on the math tests, compared
  to those living in dorms with air conditioning. Much previous research on the effects
  of extremely hot weather has been in vulnerable populations that are at risk of
  dying: either the very young or the very old, the study authors note in PLOS Medicine.  This
  study looks at the effects of heat in a population we all think of as generally
  being resilient,  said study coauthor Joe Allen, co-director of Center for Climate,
  Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.
  And while much media coverage has been on people dying prematurely,  the fact is,
  millions are impacted by heat waves,  Allen said.  And with climate change, and
  the increased duration of heat waves, we re going to see an increased impact on
  performance and learning.  The new study  is adding to a very quickly growing literature
  on the effects of heat exposure on student outcomes,  said Jisung Park, an assistant
  professor of environmental health sciences at the Fielding School of Public Health
  at the University of California, Los Angeles.  It s very consistent with other studies
  showing that hot temperatures, whether at home or in the classroom, can have a detrimental
  effect on learning.  No one knows exactly why we don t seem to be as smart when
  we re hot. But it may be that the body is pulling blood away from certain parts
  of the brain as it tries to cool itself down, said Park, who wasn t involved in
  the current study.  Of course, the elephant in the room is that heat waves are going
  to be much more frequent,  Park said.  While a 2 degree increase in average temperature
  may not sound like much, an additional 30 days of temperatures above 95 degrees
  each year may sound more urgent.  '

text: 'GENEVA: Adults and children should consume a maximum of 10 percent of their
  daily calories in the form of saturated fat such as meat and butter and one percent
  from trans fats to reduce the risk of heart disease, the World Health Organization
  said on Friday.  The draft recommendations, the first since 2002, are aimed at reducing
  non-communicable diseases, led by cardiovascular diseases, blamed for 72 percent
  of the 54.7 million estimated deaths worldwide every year, many before the age of
  70.  Dietary saturated fatty acids and trans-fatty acids are of particular concern
  because high levels of intake are correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular
  diseases,  Dr. Francesco Branca, Director of WHO s Department of Nutrition for Health
  and Development, told reporters. The dietary recommendations are based on scientific
  evidence developed in the last 15 years, he added. The United Nations agency has
  invited public comments until June 1 on the recommendations, which it expects to
  finalize by year-end. Saturated fat is found in foods from animal sources such as
  butter, cow s milk, meat, salmon and egg yolks, and in some plant-derived products
  such as chocolate, cocoa butter, coconut, palm and palm kernel oils. An active adult
  needs about 2,500 calories per day, Branca said.  So we are talking about 250 calories
  coming from saturated fat and that is approximately a bit less than 30 grams of
  saturated fat,  he said. That amount of fat could be found in 50 grams (1.76 oz)
  of butter, 130-150 grams of cheese with 30 percent fat, a liter of full fat milk,
  or in 50 grams of palm oil, he said. Trans fats Trans fats occur naturally in meat
  and dairy products. But the predominant source is industrially-produced and contained
  in baked and fried foods such as fries and doughnuts, snacks, and partially hydrogenated
  cooking oils and fats often used by restaurants and street vendors. In explicit
  new advice, WHO said that excessive amounts of saturated fat and trans fat should
  be replaced by polyunsaturated fats, such as fish, canola and olive oils.  Reduced
  intake of saturated fatty acids have been associated with a significant reduction
  in risk of coronary heart disease when replaced with polyunsaturated fatty acids
  or carbohydrates from whole grains,  it said. Total fat consumption should not exceed
  30 percent of total energy intake to avoid unhealthy weight gain, it added. The
  recommendations complement other WHO guidelines including limiting intake of free
  sugars and sodium. '

  as party s Karachi division president due to health issues, Geo News reported Friday.
  While explaining the reason for the decision, Dr Asim told PPP Co-Chairperson Asif
  Ali Zardari that he won t be able to take up the responsibilities associated with
  the post as he has to travel abroad for a surgery. He added that he will continue
  working for the party as a worker. Dr Asim was appointed as the president of party''s
  Karachi division last year in November.  In response to his decision, PPP announced
  that Dr Asim will be given new and important responsibilities. Dr Asim''s resignation
  letter was accepted by PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.  "Dr Asim has done
  a lot for the party," said Bilawal, adding that Dr Asim took up the role despite
  health issues.  Dr Asim will be given new responsibilities once he returns after
  undergoing surgery, added Bilawal.  SC allows Dr Asim to go abroad for treatment
  once more Those with treason cases against them are sitting abroad easily, observed
  Justice Qazi Faez Isa On November 16, the Supreme Court of Pakistan had directed
  the government to strike off Dr Asim Hussain from the Exit Control List (ECL) so
  he can travel abroad for treatment. Dr Asim, a former petroleum minister and PPP
  Karachi chief, is accused in three cases: two of corruption during his stint in
  the last federal government and one of facilitating terrorists at his hospital.
  During the SC hearing on November 16, Dr Asim''s counsel informed the bench, comprising
  Justice Mushir Alam and Justice Qazi Faez Isa, that his client followed the apex
  court''s earlier permission to travel abroad for treatment and return in a month.
  In his remarks, Justice Isa wondered why the implementation of the law is not the
  same for all citizens.  He observed that those with serious cases against them,
  including treason, are sitting abroad, questioning if anything has been done to
  bring them back. On August 29, Dr Asim was allowed to leave for London for a back
  surgery and ordered to submit a surety bond of Rs6 million. Dr Asim, a close aide
  of former president and PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari, was detained by the Rangers
  in August 2015, while he was heading the provincial higher education department.
  He was later transferred to the custody of the civilian law enforcement agencies. '

  \ officials for torture and use of force against the peaceful protesters of the\
  \ Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on September 1.\nTalking to reporters here, the\

  He said that the use of brutal force against nonviolent protesters was against the\

  \ division among the provinces. He claimed that the interior minister had accepted\

text: "A tale of true friendship\nPaulo Coelho de Souza, the Brazilian lyricist, eminent\
  \ literary figure and winner of several international awards, described friendship\
  \ in the following words: \u201Cfriendship is not about whom you know the longest.\
  \ It is about who came and never left\u201D. What he said is quintessential of the\
  \ friendship between Pakistan and China, which is far beyond the realm of normal\
  \ diplomatic relations between two states.\_\nThe longstanding diplomatic relations\
  \ between Pakistan and China, which were established on May 21, 1951, have withstood\
  \ the vicissitudes of time and grown into an enduring, multifaceted, deep-rooted\
  \ friendship that would perhaps require a new diplomatic phrase to describe them.\
  \ This friendship is underpinned by mutual trust and confidence. Mutuality of interests\
  \ remains the hallmark of the bilateral ties between Pakistan and China.\nNotwithstanding\
  \ the fact that Pakistan was a US ally, relations with China have been the cornerstone\
  \ of its foreign policy. It was Pakistan\u2019s alliance with the US and strong\
  \ ties with China that enabled it to facilitate the end of China\u2019s isolation\
  \ by orchestrating rapprochement between China and the US. Pakistan has also been\
  \ supporting China on all issues of importance \u2013 especially those that are\
  \ related to the question of China\u2019s sovereignty over Hong Kong, Taiwan and\
  \ Tibet and sensitive matters such as human rights. The Chinese leaders do appreciate\
  \ Pakistan\u2019s steadfast and unqualified support on these issues.\nOver the years,\
  \ China has supported the Kashmir cause and extended economic and military assistance\
  \ to Pakistan. When Pakistan was abandoned by the US during the 1965 war with India,\
  \ China was there to help Pakistan \u2013 just as it did in subsequent crises.\_\
  \nChina has played a significant role in the economic progress of Pakistan. The\
  \ construction of the KKH Highway, the Heavy Mechanical Complex at Taxila and the\
  \ Chashma Nuclear Plant are the monuments of the burgeoning relations between both\
  \ countries.\nIn the backdrop of the US-India deal for the transfer of civilian\
  \ nuclear technology \u2013 which Pakistan saw as a discriminatory act \u2013 China\
  \ once again exhibited the strength of the friendship between both countries by\
  \ agreeing to help Pakistan build the Chashma-IV and Chashma-V projects. It also\
  \ provided a soft loan for the construction of those plants and brushed aside the\
  \ objections raised by the US. China has also been extending support to Pakistan\
  \ on its stance for the criteria-based admittance of new members to the Nuclear\
  \ Suppliers Group.\_\nPakistan and China have enjoyed strong defence ties. In March\
  \ 2017, the Chinese-built Low to Medium altitude Air Defence System was inducted\
  \ into the air defence system of the Pakistan Army. This will considerably enhance\
  \ its response capability to the current and emerging threats. The system is capable\
  \ of tracking and destroying a variety of aerial targets at longer ranges that fly\
  \ at low and medium altitudes.\nThe Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC), in collaboration\
  \ with China\u2019s aviation industry, conceived the co-development and co-production\
  \ of the JF-17 Thunder aircraft in 1999. For Pakistan, this was a big stride towards\
  \ attaining self-sufficiency in the field of aircraft production, which was dictated\
  \ by the turn of the events and the gravity of threats to its territorial integrity.\
  \ The PAC has already completed the production of 50 aircrafts under the Block-I\
  \ project and another 50 aircraft are being produced under the Block-II project.\
  \ Many countries have also expressed an interest in buying these aircrafts.\nArmy\
  \ Chief General Bajwa visited China in March and held productive meetings with Chinese\
  \ Foreign Minister Wang Yi who assured Bajwa that he completely understood the challenges\
  \ being faced by Pakistan. He outlined Pakistan\u2019s geo-political relevance and\
  \ contributions towards regional peace and stability and assured his support in\
  \ grappling with the challenges involved in maintaining peace.\nGeneral Bajwa also\
  \ called on General Fang Fengui \u2013 the chief of the Joint Staff Department under\
  \ the Central Military Commission \u2013 Chinese Executive Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli,\
  \ Central Military Commission Vice Chairman General Fang Changlong and commander\
  \ of the People\u2019s Liberation Army General Li Zuocheng. He discussed issues\
  \ pertaining to defence cooperation, regional security and the economy.\nThe Global\
  \ Times, a tabloid associated with the People\u2019s Daily \u2013 a mouthpiece of\
  \ Communist party of China \u2013 reported that China planned to scale up its defence\
  \ cooperation with Pakistan, including ballistic and cruise missiles and the joint\
  \ mass production of multi-role combat aircrafts. However, the spokesman of the\
  \ Chinese foreign ministry evaded a direct answer to the question on the subject\
  \ and only said that: \u201CBeijing stands for strategic balance in South Asia\u201D\
  .\nCPEC \u2013 which is a vital component of the One Belt One Road initiative with\
  \ a transformational potential \u2013 has bound China and Pakistan in an eternal\
  \ partnership for shared economic prosperity in the region and beyond. Pakistan\
  \ is likely to become the largest beneficiary in this regard.\nSun Weidong, the\
  \ Chinese ambassador to Pakistan, spoke at a reception held at the Chinese Embassy\
  \ on the 68th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China\
  \ on September 25. He described the new Chinese vision and the country\u2019s relations\
  \ with Pakistan in the following words: \u201CWe believe that there should be a\
  \ global partnership with dialogue over confrontation, partnership over alliance.\
  \ We are committed to promoting the [One Belt One Road] initiative. We call on building\
  \ a new type of international relations, featured by win-win cooperation. These\
  \ claims have gained \u2026recognition and support among the international community.\
  \ We are also ready to make joint efforts with all countries to build [a] community\
  \ of shared prosperity for mankind.\n\u201CChina always puts the China-Pakistan\
  \ relationship as the priority of its foreign policy. Fighting against terrorism\
  \ is a strategic decision of Pakistan. The great efforts and national sacrifices\
  \ made by Pakistan for the cause of international counter-terrorism should be fully\
  \ understood and acknowledged by the international community. China firmly supports\
  \ Pakistan to carry out its counter-terrorism strategy based on its own national\
  \ conditions. We will, as always, support Pakistan\u2019s efforts in safeguarding\
  \ its national sovereignty and security.\n\u201CThe Chinese people are proud of\
  \ having Pakistan as our iron brother. Looking ahead, China will always stand with\
  \ Pakistan to go through thick and thin, and make new progress side by side\u201D\
  .\nThe Chinese ambassador\u2019s speech should be enough to silence those who have\
  \ been expressing scepticism about the weakening of relations between both countries\
  \ in the backdrop of the Brics Declaration and China\u2019s overtures of friendship\
  \ towards India. They probably need to read the National Action Plan carefully.\n\
  The new Chinese vision is about partnership and ending confrontation. This is also\
  \ what Pakistan wants. Besides China, even Pakistan has invited India to join CPEC.\
  \ What is so worrying about a thaw in relations between India and China? At a distant\
  \ date, China\u2019s cordial relations with Pakistan and India could perhaps become\
  \ instrumental in helping both hostile countries resolve their differences \u2013\
  \ just like Pakistan did in the case of China and the US.\n\_\nThe writer is a freelance\

text: "Education in the time of terror\nTwo harrowing wake-up calls \u2013 the Taliban\
  \ attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in December 2014 that saw over 140\
  \ children killed, and the more recent attack on the Charsadda-based Bacha Khan\
  \ University \u2013 and two well-publicized APCs later, there are yet few reassuring\
  \ signs that our ruling elite has learnt any lessons from the traumatic experience\
  \ that the nation has gone through in the past two decades.\nIn particular, it seems\
  \ to have acquired little understanding of the importance of education, not only\
  \ in the ongoing war against terror, but also as an integral part of national development.\n\
  The current wave of anti-education terror that gained salience in the wake of the\
  \ Taliban insurgency, resulting in the near-fatal attack on Malala Yusufzai and\
  \ her friends in 2011, has terrorised the nation\u2019s school-going children and\
  \ their parents and teachers and has made education virtually a hostage to terror.\
  \ There is a culture of impunity surrounding egregious violations of human rights,\
  \ which represents a major barrier to education. Attacks on children, teachers and\
  \ schools, and recourse to widespread and systematic rape and other forms of sexual\
  \ violence as a weapon of war are among the starkest examples of violations that\
  \ have been unleashed in Pakistan in recent decades.\nChildren and schools in Pakistan\
  \ today are on the front line of terrorist attacks, with classrooms, teachers and\
  \ pupils seen as \u2018low-hanging\u2019 targets. There is a growing fear among\
  \ children to attend school, among teachers to give classes, among parents to send\
  \ their children to school and among school administrators to preemptively close\
  \ down schools to avoid public criticism of their laxity and accusations of \u2018\
  security lapse\u2019. Insurgent groups have repeatedly attacked education infrastructure,\
  \ girls\u2019 schools in particular.\nWhile the state institutions responsible for\
  \ keeping the fear of terrorism at bay are in a state of disarray and confusion,\
  \ riven by turf issues of who is responsible for what and who is to blame for what,\
  \ the ordinary citizen just shudders at the prospect of leading a life with the\
  \ constant risk of losing her or her children\u2019s life, limb or dignity. Many\
  \ are commending extreme steps such as shutting all the schools down, indefinitely\
  \ or \u2013 for those who can afford it \u2013 leaving the country permanently.\
  \ These reductionist and defeatist reactions can only further embolden those who\
  \ are sworn enemies of education, especially for girls and the underprivileged.\n\
  After endless quibbling for over a decade whether the war on terror, which the military\
  \ was willy-nilly dragged into after the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001, was \u2018\
  ours\u2019 or \u2018theirs\u2019 and whether the Taliban were our friends or foes,\
  \ we suddenly awakened \u2013 rather late in the day \u2013 to the reality of the\
  \ fundamentalist threat our \u2018friends\u2019 from across the Durand Line (and\
  \ their allies in Pakistan) posed to our existence. It was only after the 2008 elections\
  \ and Gen Musharraf\u2019s forced resignation from the presidency that some serious,\
  \ if half-hearted, efforts to counter the internal insurgency threat began to be\
  \ taken.\nIronically, the ownership of the fight against militancy increased under\
  \ a civilian democratic government compared to Musharraf\u2019s rule. The PPP government,\
  \ showed greater determination to seriously engage in counterinsurgency and counterterrorism\
  \ operations, and launched Operation Rah-e-Nijat led by Gen Kayani. Despite these\
  \ ostensibly serious efforts to stem the tide of terrorism, there were serious gaps\
  \ in establishing the writ of the state, not only in Fata, but also in southern\
  \ Punjab and lately in Karachi. Neither were any serious efforts made to put in\
  \ place an institutional structure to deal with the likely blowback from the military\
  \ operations against insurgents, both Pakistani and foreign, who had found safe\
  \ havens across the country \u2013 especially in unsuspecting urban areas. It was,\
  \ however, left to Gen Raheel Sharif to lead the more decisive and ongoing Operation\
  \ Zarb-e-Azb in North Waziristan, despite some initial feet-dragging by the civilian\
  \ leadership.\nEducational development receives the lowest priority in the development\
  \ agendas of our ruling elites, who find colourful mega projects such as Orange\
  \ lines and Red metro-buses, urban development and shining malls much more appealing\
  \ to their middle class vote-banks, as well as yielding more lucrative kickbacks\
  \ to themselves and their cronies. They fail to realise that bringing education\
  \ to those who for generations have been denied even basic access for reasons of\
  \ social, economic or geographic exclusion is the most urgent priority if we want\
  \ to emerge as a self-respecting nation.\nEducation (or the lack of it) has also\
  \ been a driving force of terrorism and has been an underlying element in the political\
  \ dynamic fuelling violence. Intra-state armed conflict is often associated with\
  \ grievances and perceived injustices linked to identity, faith, ethnicity and region.\
  \ Education can make a difference in all these areas, tipping the balance in favour\
  \ of peace \u2013 or conflict.\nToo little education, unequal access to education,\
  \ and imparting the wrong type of education can be a catalyst in helping terrorist\
  \ groups to recruit susceptible youths for undertaking terrorist attacks and suicide\
  \ missions, as in the case of the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, sectarian groups such as the\
  \ Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Sipah-ieSahaba and Lahkar-e-Taiba and, more recently, Isis\
  \ and their sympathizers in Pakistan. Many such groups often enjoy the patronage\
  \ of intelligence agencies, within and across the country\u2019s own borders for\
  \ potential use in proxy wars against perceived adversaries.\nThere is also a strong,\
  \ if intractable, nexus between limited or poor quality of education and unemployment\
  \ and poverty, which fuels the terrorist juggernaut. When large numbers of young\
  \ people are denied access to decent quality basic education, the resulting poverty,\
  \ unemployment and frustration serve as forceful recruiting agents for terrorist\
  \ outfits. The \u2018youth bulge\u2019 \u2013 often considered as a blessing in\
  \ disguise \u2013 turns out to be a bane and a potential threat as the terrorist\u2019\
  s reserve army.\nNotwithstanding the loud proclamations by successive governments\
  \ at domestic and international fora, education has always been at the backburner\
  \ of policymaking for decades after independence. The long period of neglect of\
  \ education in general and of marginalised sections in particular has sown the seeds\
  \ for the huge backlog that exists in the universalisation of elementary education\
  \ even today. As many as 25 million school\u2013going age (5-15) children were currently\
  \ estimated to be out of any schools (with the minimalist brick and mortar definition),\
  \ according to a report by the NGO, Alif Ailaan.\nThe war on terror, however existentially\
  \ important it may be to Pakistan, should not be allowed to divert our attention\
  \ from the primacy of education as a national goal. It is about time a high-level\
  \ national conference, even more well-structured than the two APCs on terrorism\
  \ and more representative of the stakeholders \u2013 including educators, civil\
  \ society representatives and those of the working poor, such as trade unions, child\
  \ labour activists and primary school teachers \u2013 were held with a view to putting\
  \ education back on the frontline of the national agenda and drawing a definitive\
  \ roadmap of removing illiteracy and terrorism. The roadmap should spell out the\
  \ modalities, financial implications and institutional responsibilities to help\
  \ realise the nation\u2019s educational dream.\nThe writer is a former professor\

  \ i.e. 2011-2015.\nPunjab, followed by Sindh, KP, AJK, Balochistan, ICT, Gilgit\
  \ Baltistan, has the highest percentage of the registered cases of the VAW in the\
  \ year 2015. The Punjab reported the highest number of \u201Chonor\u201D crimes\
  \ in comparison to the other regions, including Sindh, which is generally perceived\
  \ to have the greatest number of greatest number of pockets of \u201Chonor\u201D\
  \ killings.\_\nKPK reported the highest number of cases of harassment at workplace\
  \ in 2015. Sexual violence that includes rape showed an increase in registered cases\
  \ in Punjab, Sindh, KPK, AJK and ICT.\_\nDomestic violence kept on rising in all\
  \ the four provinces during the years under study. Burning was also on rise in Punjab,\
  \ Sindh, KPK, Balochistan and ICT. Vani, one of several harmful cultural practices,\
  \ is not reported from any part of the country except Punjab and KPK. In Punjab\
  \ three cases were reported in 2015, six cases in 2014, three cases in 2013, four\
  \ cases in 2012 and two cases in 2011. In KPK, five cases were reported in 2015,\
  \ four in 2014, one in 2013 and two each in 2012 and 2011.\nDetails show that the\
  \ total number of reported cases of VAW in Pakistan from 2011 to 2015 are 9395,\
  \ 9999, 9185, 11557 and 13228 respectively. The trend shows a gradual increase in\
  \ reported VAW crime from 2011 to 2015 except in the year 2013. Overall, a 34.2%\
  \ increase can be observed in 2015 as compared to 2011.\nIn Punjab, the number of\

  \ respectively with an increase of 5.8 % in 2015 in comparison to 2011. If the statistics\
  \ from all the other areas under consideration are combined, the result will yield\
  \ a smaller number of VAW crimes as compared to the single province of Punjab. However,\
  \ the increased reporting of VAW in Punjab could be attributed to the improved accessibility\
  \ to media and law enforcement agencies.\nIn Sindh, the report said, the number\
  \ of registered cases for the years 2011 to 2015 were 1272, 1204, 1023, 3159 and\
  \ 4630 respectively with an increase of 129% in 2015 as compared to 2011.\nIn KPK,\

  \ 2011.\nIn Balochistan, the number of VAW cases remained 220, 251, 277, 247 and\
  \ 279 for the years 2011 to 2015 respectively with an increase of 23.7% in 2015\

  In total, 53364 cases of VAW were reported from seven regions under study for the\
  \ period from 2011 to 2015. There was a 34% increase in the reported cases of VAW.\
  \ Only crimes of \u201Chonor\u201D killing showed a decrease of -24.3 in the previous\
  \ five years.\nPolice sources while quoting the report said that during the year\
  \ 2011, nearly 73% cases were reported from Punjab. Sindh had the second highest\
  \ instance of reported VAW cases with a total 1272 cases which form 14% of the total\
  \ reported cases. From KPK, total 541 cases were reported. In AJK, 379 cases were\
  \ registered while 220 cases were registered in Balochistan. ICT had a total of\

  \ total of 85 reported cases. In GB 51 cases were registered during the year while\
  \ Railways police registered 05 cases.\nIn 2013, a total of 9185 cases were reported\
  \ across the country of which 73.5% were from Punjab, 11% from Sindh, and 7% cases\
  \ from KPK. AJK reported 360 cases of VAW, and Balochistan 277. ICT had 77 reported\
  \ cases. In GB 46 cases were registered during the year, while Railways police registered\
  \ 03 cases.\nData from 2014 shows that 62% cases were registered in Punjab, 27%\
  \ in Sindh, 5% in KPK with decrease of 2 %. AJK reported 311 cases of VAW, and Balochistan\
  \ 247. ICT had 29 reported cases. In GB 49 cases were registered during the year,\
  \ while Railways police registered 05 cases.\nData from 2015 shows that 54% of VAW\

  \ of VAW, and Balochistan 279. ICT had 85 reported cases. In GB 10 cases were registered\
  \ during the year, while Railways police registered 05 cases.\nThe report said that\
  \ according to an estimate, approximately 70% to 90% of Pakistani women are subjected\
  \ to domestic violence. Various forms of domestic violence in the country include\
  \ physical, mental and emotional abuse. Some common types include honor killing,\
  \ spousal abuse, including marital rape, acid attacks and being burned by family\
  \ members.\nIn Punjab, 6859, 7542, 6755, 7211 and 7267 cases were registered for\
  \ the years from 2011 to 2015 respectively with an increase of 5.8 % in 2015 when\
  \ compared to 2011. Statistics show that crime increased in the year 2012 and dropped\
  \ in 2013; however, in 2105 it again increased as compared to 2014.\_\nIn Sindh,\
  \ 1272, 1204, 1023, 3159 and 4630 cases were registered from 2011 to 2015 respectively\
  \ with an increase of 129% in 2015 as compared to 2011 which is quite high. Statistics\
  \ show that the crime against women remained almost static in 2011 and 2012 while\
  \ it decreased a little during the year 2013. However, a sharp increase during the\
  \ year 2014 and 2015 can be seen.\_\nIf percentage of increase and decrease in VAW\
  \ cases between the year 2011 and 2015 is taken into consideration, it reveals that\
  \ in Sindh there is a striking decrease in cases of honor killing i.e. 68%. Similarly,\
  \ harassment in the workplace has also decreased by 63.7%. However, this is important\
  \ to note that total crime has increased to 129% due to the great increase in miscellaneous\
  \ crime category i.e. 235%.\nIn KPK, 541, 530, 644, 546 and 617 cases were registered\
  \ from 2011 to 2015 respectively with an increase of 13% in 2015 as compared to\
  \ 2011. Statistics show that VAW remained almost static in 2011 and 2012 while it\
  \ increased by 17% during the year 2013. However, there was again a decrease of\
  \ 0.9% during the year 2014 and again 13% increase in 2015 when compared to 2011.\_\
  \nIf percentage of increase and decrease in VAW cases between the year 2011 and\
  \ 2015 is taken into consideration, it reveals that in KPK there is a 20% increase\
  \ in honor killings. An increase of 20% in sexual violence and 32% in harassment\
  \ at the work place were noted. However, there was a 13% increase in total reported\
  \ crime as compared to 2011.\nIn Balochistan, 220, 251, 277, 247 and 279 cases were\
  \ registered in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 with an increase of 23.7% in 2015\
  \ as compared to 2011. Statistics show that VAW increased in 2012 and 2013 while\
  \ it got decreased in 2014. However, this again rose to 23.7% in 2015. All percentages\
  \ are compared to that in 2011 as base year. The trend shows slight fluctuations\
  \ in these cases. If percentage of increase and decrease in VAW cases between the\
  \ year 2011 and 2015 is taken into consideration, it reveals that there is a 20%\
  \ increase in domestic violence while honor killing decreased by 30.5%. In 2015,\
  \ six cases of burning have been registered against two cases in 2011. However,\
  \ there are no cases registered under vani and harassment at workplace during these\
  \ years.\_\nIn Islamabad Capital Territory 82, 85, 77, 29 and 85 cases were registered\
  \ in total during 2011 to 2015 respectively with an increase of 3.6% in 2015 as\
  \ compared to 2011. Statistics show that VAW increased from 2011 to 2015 except\
  \ in 2014. The trend shows the constant fluctuations in cases of VAW. If percentage\
  \ of increase and decrease in VAW cases between the year 2011 and 2015 is taken\
  \ into consideration, it reveals that domestic violence decreased by 72.5% in 2015\
  \ as compared to 2011. While there are no cases registered during these years under\
  \ honor killing, vani and harassment at workplace. In 2015, 31 cases of sexual violence\
  \ have been registered against 10 cases in 2011. However, there is a decrease in\
  \ miscellaneous cases by 13%.\_\nIn AJK 379, 349, 360, 311 and 335 cases were registered\
  \ during the years 2011 to 2015 respectively with a decrease of 12% in 2015 as compared\
  \ to 2011. Statistics show that 17 cases of domestic violence were registered in\
  \ 2015 as compared to only one case in 2011. It can be seen that domestic violence\
  \ increased during these five years; whereas, no cases were registered under vani\
  \ and harassment at workplace. However, two cases of burning during the year 2012\
  \ and one case of honor killing during the year 2014 were registered. Sexual violence\
  \ increased to 63% in 2015 against that in 2011. However, there is a decrease in\

  \    If we see the political class floundering and taking false steps, if we see\
  \ political gurus who have been in politics for a long time \u2014 and who perhaps\
  \ for that reason are unable to free themselves from the clutches of the past \u2014\
  \ fighting yesterday\u2019s battles, we should neither be surprised nor dismayed.\
  \ Old mindsets are hard to conquer. The past is comfortable territory. Stepping\
  \ into the future needs a new kind of mental equipment.  We are not the only country\
  \ in the world with a history of military coups. Authoritarianism has had strong\
  \ roots and a more pervasive presence in societies more sophisticated than ours.\
  \ Spain had Franco ruling for decades. Salazar in Portugal ruled even longer than\
  \ Franco. Greece in the 1960s was under a brutal military dictatorship. In all three\
  \ countries democracy has established itself in such a way that it takes an effort\
  \ of the imagination to remember their past. The journey from national darkness\
  \ to light is never easy. To succeed it needs farsighted leaders: pilots who can\
  \ negotiate narrow straits and treacherous shores. Spain, Portugal and Greece had\
  \ such leaders. We are in a similar transition and, as is only natural, having a\
  \ rough passage as we transit from dictatorship to democracy. But whatever our difficulties,\
  \ we should remember that voyages such as ours, on rolling seas, are never smooth.\
  \ We shouldn\u2019t be such simpletons as to think that powerful quarters with a\
  \ vested interest in authoritarianism would reconcile themselves to democracy so\
  \ soon. Such elements will always conspire against democracy, always insidiously\
  \ whisper that the Pakistani political class is irredeemably corrupt and incompetent.\
  \ And there will always be sections of the media, and a section of the political\
  \ class, willing to play into the hands of such elements. There is nothing new about\
  \ corruption in Pakistan. Pakistan\u2019s dominant classes \u2014 political, military\
  \ and bureaucratic \u2014 are all bathed in the same waters, drinking from the same\
  \ stream, supping at the same table. About military and bureaucratic corruption\
  \ what we usually encounter is the silence of the lambs. But let politicians come\
  \ to power \u2014 Benazir Bhutto, Nawaz Sharif, Asif Zardari or Yusuf Raza Gilani\
  \ \u2014 and we hear the roar of the lions. Which is not to say that our politicians\
  \ couldn\u2019t do better. In a milieu such as ours they are, like Caesar\u2019\
  s wife, under a double obligation to be above suspicion and not give cause to slanderous\
  \ tongues to wag. Spain, Portugal and Greece had a better cast of democratic leaders\
  \ than we can lay claim to. Even so, some balance has to be kept if we wish to preserve\
  \ the large scheme of things. By all means excoriate the corrupt and inept politician.\
  \ Hold him to a higher level of conduct. But do so in good faith, without falling\
  \ into the trap of elements whose goal is not the good of the nation but their own\
  \ good: individual interest overriding the collective interest, in the name of the\
  \ smoothest promises.   And it is not only the political class or its leaders who\
  \ are stuck in the past, fighting yesterday\u2019s battles, flailing mightily at\
  \ dead horses. Much of the national commentariat \u2014 pundits, analysts, and TV\
  \ stars \u2014 are afflicted with the same syndrome, more at ease with familiar\
  \ categories than with the agenda of the future. Why are some of our TV channels\
  \ so mesmerized with such certified political comics as Shaikh Rashid Ahmad? Politics\
  \ should rise above the level of buffoonery, even if the buffoonery is carried on\
  \ with a serious face. Why has a section of the commentariat honed such an expertise\
  \ for kicking dead horses? Why do they go on and on about dead issues?  They are\
  \ not to blame. Walking old trails is easier than charting new territory. Musharraf\
  \ was swept aside by circumstances. History overtook him somewhere in 2006-2007\
  \ and then left him far behind. His exit was long drawn out but it was foretold.\
  \ He is yesterday\u2019s man. Why is a section of the political class so bent on\
  \ keeping his memory alive? Other countries have gone through worse dictatorships.\
  \ South Africa\u2019s past was more brutal and repressive than ours. But when white\
  \ rule ended and the ANC came to power, South Africa, under Nelson Mandela\u2019\
  s inspiring leadership, drew a line under the past and moved swiftly beyond it.\
  \ The country has huge problems, social and economic, but it is trying to grapple\
  \ with them as best as it can, instead of shouting endlessly about the evils of\
  \ white rule which, in the circumstances, would be little better than escapism.\
  \ The history of military coups in Pakistan will not end with political gimmickry\
  \ or rhetoric. It will only end when politicians can prove by their competence and\
  \ understanding of things that they are superior to any alternative. But if they\
  \ are caught in petty squabbles, if the quality of their discourse is not uplifting,\
  \ and if, on the other hand, the military remains a powerful and disciplined institution,\
  \ no Article Six of the Constitution can be a sufficient safeguard of democracy.\
  \  The question of Musharraf\u2019s trial has proved a nine-days\u2019 wonder, PM\
  \ Gilani neatly stepping out of this complication by declaring that as he was a\
  \ consensus prime minister he would only go for a trial if there was a  consensus\
  \ of the entire National Assembly behind the move. With the National Assembly divided\
  \ on this issue it is now as good as dead, which is some embarrassment for those\
  \ crying, so to speak, for Musharraf\u2019s blood. Gilani\u2019s further admonition\
  \ that we should do only that which is doable amounts to rubbing salt into this\
  \ discomfiture. Gilani is proving a more adept politician than most people gave\
  \ him credit for when he became prime minister. He is cool and unflappable and measures\
  \ his words carefully. As a self-proclaimed consensus prime minister he is proving\
  \ true to the description by tending to the legitimate concerns of everyone \u2014\
  \ repeat, everyone \u2014 in the National Assembly. For this reason it is scarcely\
  \ surprising that he enjoys enormous goodwill across the house, regardless of party\
  \ affiliations, which is a feat unrivalled in the parliamentary history of this\
  \ country.  Reports of his differences with President Asif Zardari are exaggerated.\
  \ Insofar as he is more his own man than when he was picked as prime minister, some\
  \ friction between his office and the presidency is inevitable. Chairmen of the\
  \ board and chief executive officers always have their differences: two swords in\
  \ one scabbard, etc. But this doesn\u2019t amount to a revolt or anything like it.\
  \ Gilani\u2019s only political home and base is the PPP, without which he would\
  \ be out in the wilderness. And he knows it, or should. For reasons we are all familiar\
  \ with, Zardari is a divisive figure. While inspiring loyalty among his close friends\
  \ he doesn\u2019t have much of a reputation (except for things he would gladly forget)\
  \ as far as the public is concerned. The unifying figure is Gilani and when the\
  \ succession in the PPP finally takes place, the torch passing from Zardari to Bilawal,\
  \ Gilani will have played a role in this process. Gilani as keeper of the PPP flame:\
  \ whoever could have thought it possible a year and a half ago? The minus-one formula\
  \ is less formula than fantasy, the wish to see Zardari put on a flying suit and\
  \ disappear from the presidency. It is not going to happen. Indeed, there is no\
  \ way to make this happen short of an intervention by Triple One Brigade. And if\
  \ those trucks ever roll we can all go to the mountains and seek nirvana there.\
  \ So whether anyone likes it or not, if we want to preserve democracy the first\
  \ requirement is to abide Zardari. Admittedly a tough choice but then who said life\
  \ was easy?   The times are critical. We are slowly stepping out of the wreckage\
  \ of the Musharraf era. Amongst other things, the Taliban are on the run, for which\
  \ we owe our soldiers our deepest thanks. They have performed splendidly, redeeming\
  \ the army\u2019s reputation tarnished by Musharraf\u2019s many follies and blunders.\
  \ At this of all junctures we can afford no disruption in our national life. The\
  \ people of Pakistan paid no heed to the gloom pundits on Aug 14. It was a joy to\
  \ see them celebrate. We should take heed from the people and leave the pundits\
  \ to their devices.  Email: [email\_protected]"

text: "Tailors working day and night to meet orders\nWith few days left for Eid, the\
  \ tailors of the twin cities are working round the clock to meet the pending orders\
  \ of their valued customers. It is always a difficult yet highly profitable task\
  \ to stretch the working hours of stitching to meet the deadlines of the orders\
  \ and deliver them on time. Though power outages have highly severed their work,\
  \ but still they manage to cope up with the work and they try to deliver suits before\
  \ Eid. There are many who deliver two to three days before Eid before departing\
  \ to their own villages to celebrate Eid with their loved ones.\nThere are many\
  \ customers who place the orders well before time and get their clothes stitched\
  \ well before Ramazan begins, but there are also many who wait till the Ramazan\
  \ begins for the new and better material to come in the market and then they go\
  \ for embroidery and stitching. Sabahat Hussain, a tailor by profession, while speaking\
  \ with this scribe said that the trend of stitching tailored clothes are now declining\
  \ with the passage of time. Earlier, women used to bring three to four suits for\
  \ Eid, but now with the availability and affordability of readymade clothes, women\
  \ prefer to shop off the rack and giving us less suits for stitching.\nSadia Haider,\
  \ a customer said that she's happy that Pret line of designers can also be ordered\
  \ online if we don't have time to visit the stores. It is also a daily ritual for\
  \ us to go to flagship stores to get our Eid dress. \u201CI would prefer to get\
  \ my size from a designer brand instead of arguing with my tailor for a dress,\u201D\
  \ she added. As far as the men \u2018shalwar qameez\u2019 suits are concerned and\
  \ to keep up with the latest trends of \u2018kurta\u2019 and shirts, many tailors\
  \ have kept machine embroidery workers so that the customers can choose their patterns\
  \ under the same roof and they don\u2019t have to explore further.\nThough readymade\
  \ clothes have flooded the market with reasonable rates, there are many customers\
  \ who are not satisfied with the material they use. Single suit of men\u2019s \u2018\
  shalwar qameez\u2019 ranges from Rs995 to Rs5,000 depending upon the material used\
  \ and the details of the embroidery, buttons and design. Sakhawat, who is a tailor\
  \ master working in Scheme III of Chaklala, while talking to this scribe said that\
  \ this is the time when we are very careful about hiring a new worker for our shop,\
  \ because there are many unskilled workers who spoil the dresses of Eidul Fitr and\
  \ then their reputation gets at stake. \u201CI hired an inexperienced tailor for\
  \ my shop and he spoiled the whole wedding order and then I had to repay my customer\
  \ Rs48,000. Besides this there are many incidents where tailors who could not meet\
  \ the deadlines ran away with the materials.\nThen police complaints are lodged\
  \ and the shop is sealed,\u201D he said. Abdus Samad, a customer at the tailor shop,\
  \ was of the view that he trusts his tailor as he\u2019s the best in the area. \u201C\
  His stitching is best and he delivers on time. Even if I give the order few days\
  \ before Eid, he would give priority to me and would never say \u2018no\u2019 to\
  \ me because I\u2019m his old and loyal customer. But I still make sure that there\
  \ is ample time for alteration if needed,\u201D he said. There are many people who\
  \ prefer the ready-made clothes over tailoring as it saves time and effort. Aqsa\
  \ had a different view saying that why go for the hassle of tailoring when we can\
  \ conveniently buy the clothes off the rack for almost the same price. \u201CWith\
  \ the convenience of shopping malls in the city we can get multiple brands under\
  \ the same roof. The brands and their replicas have made life easy for us. Just\
  \ walk in, choose and pay,\u201D she said. Saleema, a customer quite perturbed with\
  \ her tailor said that tailors are also working like lawyers who manage to give\
  \ us new dates every time we visit them. \_"

text: "SC forms body to probe illegal police appointments\nThree-member committee\
  \ comprising senior police officials\nwill submit report within three months\n\n\
  Karachi\nThe Supreme Court formed a three-member inquiry committee on Wednesday\
  \ to probe \u201Cillegal\u201D appointments in the Sindh Reserve Police in Hyderabad\
  \ and other districts of the province.\nThe directives came on suo moto proceedings\
  \ on alleged corruption worth billions of rupees through illegal appointments by\
  \ the police department\u2019s selection board.\nA three-member bench of the apex\
  \ court headed by Justice Amir Hani Muslim ordered senior police officers Additional\
  \ IG AD Khawaja, AIG Sanaullah Abbasi and AIG Naeem Ahmed Sheikh to investigate\
  \ the board\u2019s appointments in the SRP in Hyderabad and other districts.\nThe\
  \ court observed that the inquiry committee would examine the appointment of all\
  \ wings, units, zones including different units of the SRPs (except those already\
  \ probed by DIG Munir A Shaikh earlier) in Hyderabad and all other districts on\
  \ a case-to-case basis and record their findings.\nThe court observed that in case\
  \ the appointments were found to be illegal, the policemen would be removed from\
  \ service after a show-cause notice and proceedings initiated against members of\
  \ the selection board who recommended them.\nThe court observed that the Establishment\
  \ Division secretary would proceed against PSP officers who were the members of\
  \ the selection board for making the illegal appointments and the chief secretary\
  \ or any other competent authority would proceed against member who was an officer\
  \ of the police department.\nThe committee will complete its report within three\
  \ months.\nThe court directed the chief secretary, the home secretary and the IGP\
  \ to ensure that proposed committee was provided with requisite documents and information\
  \ sought by it. In case of failure on their part, they will face contempt charges.\n\
  The court also ordered that the provincial government would not transfer any member\
  \ of the committee outside Sindh until the inquiry was completed.\nThe court earlier\
  \ heard Advocate General Sindh Abdul Fateh Malik, Additional IG Traffic Khadim Hussain\
  \ Bhatti, DIG Munir A. Shaikh, DIG Aftab Ahmed Pathan and DIG Naeem Ahmed Shaikh\
  \ and have perused the material available on record.\nThe court observed that earlier,\
  \ DIG Mirpurkhas Munir Ahmed Sheikh mentioned in his report that a number of posts\
  \ in police were filled without fulfilling legal and codal formalities and the high\
  \ court had given three months\u2019 time to the IGP for taking action against the\
  \ delinquent officers in light of inquiry report.\nHowever, the directives were\
  \ not followed by the IGP and on the contrary DIG SRP Dr Muhammad Amin Yousufzai\
  \ had sought the approval of the incumbent IGP to recruit 126 petitioners.\nThe\
  \ court observed that instead of complying with the orders of the high court, the\
  \ IGP had allowed further illegalities in the recruitment process by granting the\
  \ approval.\nThe court noted that record did not reveal that at any point of time,\
  \ the IGP had ever taken action on the report.\nBesides, in the intervening period,\
  \ the then DIG SRP Hyderabad Aftab Ahmed Pathan had written many letters to the\
  \ IGP on the issue of the illegal appointments in the SRP Sukkur and Hyderabad,\
  \ but the latter did not respond to them.\nSubsequently, the court observed, on\
  \ the intervention of the court, the additional IG traffic Karachi was appointed\
  \ the inquiry officer to hush up the issue.\nThe court observed that findings of\
  \ the inquiry report of the Additional IG Traffic Khadim Hussain Bhatti were self-contradictory\
  \ and appeared to be an attempt to cover up the illegalities committed by senior\
  \ police officers.\nThe court also rejected the inquiry report of Additional IG\
  \ traffic saying that it was dishonest and had been activated at the behest of the\
  \ IGP after the intervention of the court. The court also issued a show-cause notice\
  \ to the IGP to explain as to why did had he failed to respond to the recommendations\
  \ made in the inquiry report of DIG Munir A. Shaikh and the letters sent by DIG\
  \ Abdul Khaliq Shaikh and DIG Aftab Ahmed Pathan.\nThe court directed the IGP to\
  \ submit an explanation within two weeks as to why had he defied court orders by\
  \ approving the proposal of appointing 126 petitioners weeks.\nThe court accepted\
  \ the inquiry reports of DIG  Munir Sheikh endorsed by DIG Abdul Khaliq Shaikh and\
  \ directed that all those who were illegally appointed in the SRP Sukkur should\
  \ be removed from service forthwith after notice.\nThe court also ordered that show-cause\
  \ notices be issued to the members of selection board by the Establishment Division\
  \ secretary if they belonged to the PSP cadre and by the chief secretary or the\
  \ home secretary in case they are a police officer for misconduct and extending\
  \ favours through illegal appointments.\nThe court observed that there were inherent\
  \ defects in the appointments made by the selection board which cannot be condoned\
  \ by lapse of time as they were not qualified, overage or domiciled of different\
  \ districts.\nThe court earlier proposed to the Advocate General Sindh for referring\
  \ the matter to the NAB, but he requested that a committee be constituted comprising\
  \ senior police officers to probe into the illegalities."
