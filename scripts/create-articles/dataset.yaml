text: 'Less than a month into the job and Prime Minister Imran Khan faces his first
  potential encounter with dharna politics. That it does not come from the main opposition
  but, rather, from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) means that many will see
  this as a case of deserved retribution. For Khadim Rizvi and his cohorts have unveiled
  plans to hold the federal capital hostage once more. And this time around promises
  to be not so different from the last. Back then, of course, when the group effectively
  accused the then PMLN government of blasphemy over a clerical error   Khan, instead
  of calling for calm, chose to insist that the in-house inquiry into the matter be
  made public. And today, he stands on the receiving end. For the TLP has announced
  a long march from Lahore to Islamabad scheduled for this week. Admittedly, the state
  itself is not in the religo-political party s direct line of fire. But, in reality,
  this amounts to little more than mere semantics given that the latter is doing its
  best to push the new set-up into a corner over blasphemy. Indeed, the TLP has said
  that it will stay put unless and until the government cuts all diplomatic ties with
  the Netherlands over a proposed blasphemous cartoon competition organised by leader
  of the opposition, Geert Wilders. To be clear, there is no need for a sit-in at
  this stage. Not when the Senate has adopted a resolution protesting the move and
  has agreed to take the matter to the UNSC. Not when the Foreign Office had already
  registered an official complaint with the Dutch authorities. Not when the controversy
  is all set to be brought up at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council
  of Foreign Ministers powwow next month. All of which begs the question as to what
  the TLP has to gain from the anticipated dharna at this time? The short answer is
  that Rizvi is keen to build on the relative success that this party enjoyed in its
  first-ever general election; which saw it field more candidates than the PPP in
  the Punjab. And while the TLP failed to secure any National Assembly seats it did
  win two in Sindh. Moreover, the party took home more than two million votes in both
  the Lower House and in the provinces. Which of course represents a not unreasonable
  show of strength for a group that came into political being as recently as 2015.
  And as Rizvi has already said: the TLP is in it for the long haul. The litmus test
  for Khan therefore rests in how he handles the situation. Much of which will depend
  on the support he can muster from the joint opposition. It is extremely important
  that the mistakes of last November are not repeated; whereby notions of standing
  with an elected government gave way to opportunism across the board. That vacuum
  was filled by the Army who acted as a broker of peace between the agitators and
  the state. Again, the pressure is on to avoid a similar scenario. It is sincerely
  hoped that vendetta politics does not win so early in the day.  * Published in Daily

text: ' In my previous article, I talked about the extraordinary contribution of Punjabi
  music directors to Bombay film music. In this article we shall appreciate the very
  rich and outstanding contribution of Punjabi song writers or lyricists, as they
  are also known, some of who have also been celebrated poets. I consulted two distinguished
  poets, who are very close friends of mine, in Stockholm before writing this article.
  Ahmed Faqih s book,  Badshah Nanga Hai  was awarded the Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi award
  2006-2007 and Masood Qamar in collaboration with Hussain Abid had come out with  Kaghaz
  pey bani Dhoop , which has in recent months been receiving rave reviews in Pakistan,
  including one by the Vice Chancellor of Karachi University, for making the provocative
  point that while Lahore still conforms to the classical tradition of writing ghazal
  (comprising a number of two-line verses, independent of one another, but all about
  love of a woman, requited and unrequited), Karachi on the other hand, represents
  the modern, innovative nazm (several interconnected verses focusing on one subject).
  Both are also keen students of music and fully familiar with Punjabi genre of poetry
  as well. I wanted to know what position the film geet (verses meant to be sung)
  occupied in the different classes of poetry. I learnt that geet and nazm are closely
  related and that the geet is simply poetry which can easily be expressed in melody.
  Film songs can be geets, nazms and ghazals. However, geets are specially written
  for a song. In light of such a discussion, my understanding is that since Punjabis
  were fully conversant with Urdu/Hindi or Hindustani prose and poetry they were able
  to respond innovatively to the demands of the film industry. In doing so they brought
  in the Punjabi tappas and kafis and other such genres into their Hindustani verses
  and created an exotic film song-writing culture than existed traditionally in the
  more orthodox regions of classical Urdu and Hindi poetry. Some wrote in both Hindustani
  and Punjabi and were catering for all three film centres. Music director Vinod and
  his family   another scion of Lahore Qamar Jalalabadi The earliest Punjabi who started
  writing for all three industries was Dina Nath Madhok, better known as D. N. Madhok
  (born Gujranwala 1902   died Hyderabad Deccan 1982). Others from the pre-partition
  era included Kidar Sharma, Aziz Kashmiri, Qamar Jalalabadi (Om Prakash Bhandari),
  Zahir Kashmiri, Nazim Panipati, Saifuddin Saif, Tanveer Naqvi, Raja Mehdi Ali Khan
  (nephew of Maulana Zafar Ali Khan), Qatil Shifai, Prem Dhawan, Verma Malik and several
  others. Two Muslims who left Lahore during partition included Aziz Kashmiri (who
  until then was Lahore based) and Sahir Ludhianvi (who was not writing film songs
  at that time). Tanveer Naqvi returned to Lahore after partition. Zahir Kashmiri,
  Saifuddin Saif and Qateel Shifai were based in Lahore, but used to write for Bombay
  films as well. They stayed behind. West Punjabi Hindus and Sikhs who later made
  a great name for themselves in Bollywood include Rajinder Krishan, Anand Bakshi,
  Gulzar (Sampuran Singh Kalra) and Naqsh Lyallpuri (Balwant Rai Sharma). Shailendra
  was born in Rawalpindi, where his father had set up a small business, but the family
  was originally from Bihar and it left for Mathura, UP, much before Partition, when
  Shailendra was still going to school in Rawalpindi. I thought this fact should be
  noted, even if one cannot claim that Shailendra was a Punjabi. On the other hand,
  Nazim Panipati (just as Khawaja Ahmed Abbas) hailed from Panipat and was an Urdu-
  or rather Haryanvi-speaker. Till 1947, Ambala division was a part of united Punjab
  and therefore we include him among Punjabi song writers.  Meray piya gae Rangoon    the
  film  Patanga  is an example of collaboration between Naushad and D. N. Madhok Geet
  is simply poetry which can easily be expressed in melody As this series develops
  and evolves, we will have many occasions to discuss some of the songs which the
  Punjabis wrote for the Calcutta and Bombay film industries. However, already I want
  to make the following distinctions. D. N. Madhok was definitely the earliest of
  the Punjabis to establish himself in Bombay. Naushad has mentioned in an interview
  that during the formative phase when he was looking for a breakthrough in Bombay,
  D. N. Madhok helped him a great deal. Their finest cooperation was in the film Rattan
  (1944). The song, Sawan kae badlo unn sae ye jaa kaho  sung by Zohrabai Ambalvi
  and Karan Dewan is even now remembered with great nostalgia by film buffs. Then,
  another,  merey pia gaye Rangoon wahaan sae kyia hai telephone  sung by Shamshad
  Begum and Chitalkar (C. Ramchandra) and filmed on Nigar Sultana and comedian Gope
  in the film Patanga (1949), was a sensation. One can name dozens of others. Anand
  Bakshi properly started the trend of using Punjabi words in Hindi songs Rajinder
  Krishan (born Jalalpur Jattan, Gujrat district, 1922   died Bombay 1988) was undoubtedly
  one of the greatest geet writers and one can compare him with Shailendra in terms
  of how beautifully he could express himself in romantic poetry. I will devote more
  space to his songs in a forthcoming article. The first song, I believe, in which
  Punjabi words were used in a Hindustani film made in Bombay was penned by Aziz Kashmiri.
  The song was  Lara lappa lara lappa lyee rakdha , picturised on Meena Shorey in
  the film Eik Thee Larki (1949), and it was an instant hit. The music was by Vinod.
  All three were from Lahore originally. However, it was Anand Bakshi (born Rawalpindi
  1930 died Bombay 2002) who should be credited with starting the trend to use Punjabi
  words, phrases and even verses in Hindi songs. His output outstrips that of all
  other song writers, including non-Punjabis. Another Punjabi, Gulzar, is considered
  to have created an entirely new imagery and symbolism in his poetry and indeed in
  his film songs. Ahmed Faqih tells me that Gulzar is a class by himself. Others too
  have generated most beautiful and exquisite film songs. We shall be looking at some
  of their great creative contributions in forthcoming articles. D. N. Madhok one
  of the earliest Punjabis to write film songs Sahir Ludhianvi But the man who transformed
  the song-writing scene in Bombay and created an entirely new style of socially-conscious
  film songs with a clear message for fundamental change was undoubtedly Sahir Ludhianvi
  (given name Abdul Hayee born Ludhiana 1921   died Bombay 1980). I will devote one
  or two forthcoming articles to his contribution. With the death of Anand Bakshi
  only Gulzar remains from among the Punjabi lyricists at Bombay mentioned above,
  who is among the top-ranking song writers in Bollywood. Ishtiaq Ahmed is Professor

text: ' American democracy operates in a boisterous fashion, especially at the time
  of presidential elections every four years. President Barack Obama will be completing
  his second term in office on January 20, 2017, almost one-and-half years from now,
  but the election campaign is already heating up, with 17 Republicans and five Democrats
  having joined the race so far, scrambling to secure their party s nomination in
  the elections that will be held on November 8, 2016. The elected nominees of the
  two parties will face each otherin the poll, and one of them will become the next
  president of the United States. Two of the candidates this year, Hilary Clinton
  and Jeb Bush, belong to political dynasties. Hilary Clinton is the wife of former
  president Bill Clinton, and Jeb Bush is the son and brother of two former presidents,
  George HW Bush, and George W Bush. The Republican field is so crowded that they
  could not be accommodated on a single platform for a debate aired nationwide on
  August 6, following an established tradition. There were two debates to accommodate
  them all. Members of the Republican Party are mostly working-class middle-aged white
  voters, who tend to be conservative and religious, and are staunchly opposed to
  Obama s liberal, progressive policies, such as environmental protection, social
  networks to help the poor, and some control over the right to own guns. The party
  has, not surprisingly, attracted little participation from minorities, such as African-Americans
  (13.3 percent of the population) or Hispanics (17.1 percent). Donald Trump The Republican
  presidential candidates are indistinguishable in their fierce opposition to Obama
  s policies, vowing to eliminate his signature healthcare law on their first day
  in office. The Obama administration says it has enabled millions of low-income Americans
  to obtain health insurance. The Republicans also promise to reverse the nuclear
  treaty with Iran, if it becomes law, which has been so painstakingly negotiated
  by the US Secretary of State John Kerry and six world powers, and ratified by the
  UN Security Council. Above all, they are falling over each other in proclaiming
  their abiding fealty to the state of Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
  An unlikely candidate has emerged as a frontrunner among the Republicans   the colorful
  billionaire real-estate Mogul from New York, Donald Trump. Known mostly for his
  brash, flamboyant personality, multiple weddings and a stable of girlfriends, he
  was never considered a serious candidate, and has been the subject of much satire.
  He previously gained some notoriety for his unsubstantiated claims that President
  Obama was a Kenyan by birth and thus ineligible to be the US president. The matter,
  however, was finally laid to rest when the State of Hawaii, where he was born, produced
  Obama s official birth certificate. Trump has now eclipsed all other candidates
  in Republican opinion polls. Even if he becomes the nominee of the Republican Party,
  his prospects of victory in the general election remain slim to none. The US Supreme
  Court has removed all restrictions on political donations by wealthy donors What
  makes Donald Trump a star? For one, he has a lot of money that, unlike others, frees
  him from the need to spend time and effort in raising donations from individuals
  and corporations to support his campaign. He is quite unabashed in flouting his
  wealth, such as his fleet of luxury cars and helicopters. He is also brazen in making
  lofty promises that are unrealistic and impossible to keep. But his conservative
  supporters love his style. One of his favorite subjects is immigration. There are
  an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the US, mostly Hispanics from Mexico
  and Central American countries, who have lived here for many decades and have integrated
  to a varying degree into the American society. Trump proposes sending them to their
  home countries, without delineating the practical difficulties involved in uprooting
  so many people, including women and children, and forcibly shipping them back. He
  will build a fence along nearly two thousand miles of the Mexican border at a huge
  expense, but incredibly will make the Mexican government pay for it. Why the Mexican
  government would pay for a fence that serves the interest of the US, he does not
  explain. The field of prospective candidates seeking Democratic nomination is narrower.
  The most prominent among them is Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state
  and senator from New York. She has the greatest name recognition, and is the frontrunner.
  She, however, has been a polarizing figure in the past and the recent polls indicate
  that a majority of Americans don t trust her honesty and compassion. She and her
  husband, the former president Bill Clinton, have amassed millions of dollars in
  speaking fees since he left office. Hillary and her husband have amassed millions
  of dollars in speaking fees More recently, Hilary Clinton has been enmeshed in a
  controversy that threatens her status as her party s top candidate. While serving
  as President Obama s secretary of state, she used her personal insecure e-mail account
  to send and receive messages, instead of the official e-mail server, and some of
  the messages, it is alleged, were highly confidential. The practice is against the
  law, but Clinton maintains that none of the messages she exchanged were classified
  or confidential. The matter is now under investigation by the FBI, but it has eroded
  some public confidence in her judgment and whether she can be trusted with making
  critical decisions as president. However, being potentially the first female president,
  she is supported by women s groups. As Clinton s support fades, there are speculations
  that the vice president Joe Biden, who has sought presidency twice before, may decide
  to make a bid one more time. Whether it would be a wise decision is unclear. Many
  of his friends fear that at age 72, he may not have the stamina to go through a
  long drawn out campaign. He remains a popular figure in the country, and going through
  a presidential campaign, which is often brutal and unsparing, will expose him to
  partisan attacks. If he does not win, that may mar his legacy and reputation. Hillary
  Clinton The US is one of the most vibrant democracies in the world, but some disquieting
  developments have been threatening the basis of the democratic process. In a series
  of decisions, the US Supreme Court has removed all restrictions on the amount of
  political donations wealthy donors can make to individual candidates or political
  committees. The result is that now, a few billionaires with a political agenda of
  their own potentially have the power to sway the elections their way by heavily
  investing money in advertising for or against candidates. The highly respected former
  president, Jimmy Carter, recently warned his countrymen that the  United States
  is now an oligarchy in which unlimited political bribery has created a complete
  subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors.  Americans
  can ignore his warning only at their peril. '

text: ' My mother and I shifted out of our house on Nazareth Road soon after Abi,
  my father, died; forced to vacate the house by the owner   a nephew of the Nizam
  of Hyderabad   who felt on the day that Abi died that the contract was not valid
  anymore since it was between him and my father. Ammi Jan, my maternal aunt, and
  her husband Abbu Jan (Asad Ali, an All India Hockey player of note, who was also
  my dada s youngest brother), had been staying with us, and moved, as we did, to
  a house in PECHS for several months. Later on we shifted into the Iqbal Town house
  which was built with Abbu Jan s pension and provident fund   the way it was in the
  old days when you retired. My Khala and Khalu were like second parents for me. I
  always told friends that the Iqbal Town area was named after Iqbal Bano, being a
  little wary of Allama Iqbal and the number of things named after him everywhere.
  I got married at this house in 1970 and had my wife Nuzhat, an avid speaker, lovely
  actor and fierce activist, sail with me for almost 10 years in the Merchant Navy.
  Abi Ammi Jan passed away in 1967 while I was on the  M.V. Shams . I got to hear
  of her death as soon as my ship arrived in the dock. It was awful to see a lovely
  person go. Her asthma had been a big problem all her life and this time she could
  not beat its attack. Abbu Jan came with us to my DHA house, my first real home that
  was built with loans and borrowed money. This was where Ragni, our only child, was
  born in 1984, and where Abbu Jan expired in 1987. My mother, Ummi lived here until
  1989, until she passed away in January that year. The Iqbal Town house, however,
  was among the best periods of my life in Karachi. Despite being far away from all
  our friends  houses, we had Iqbal Ismail, Salman Kureshi, Muzaffar Ghaffar, Noel
  Colaco, Joe D Cruz, Humayun Gohar, Uncle Charlie and his daughter, Umra, and many
  others visit us there each time I was on leave or my ship was at home port. Closer
  to the house were Lala Mufti, Captain Anees Jaetapkar and the wonderful author,
  Ibn  Insha, who lived nearly a block away. Suroor Barabankvi (a wonderful poet and
  a  wonderfuller  person), whom I had met in Chittagong during a Mushaerah I held
  on my ship, knocked at my house gate one day and I was thrilled. He said he had
  arrived the night before and was going to be here for a week. We called him the
  next day and had him recite some poetry for us and four of my father s cousins who
  were his fans: Kamal Mahmood who we called Jan Ammu (singer Talat Mahmood s elder
  brother), his wife (Amna Phupi), and her brothers Ayub Chacha and Sulaiman Chacha.
  The last three were the grandchildren of Ustaad Amir Minai.  I recorded many of
  Suroor Bhai s poems that day   and more in the years to come. By the way, Suroor
  Bhai s younger brother married Jan Ammu s youngest sister (Khalida   my Phupi Jania)
  later on. Sulaiman Chacha asked me to meet his friend, Syed Nasir Jahan, when I
  came back to Karachi and settled down, in 1984, from the Merchant Navy. I decided
  to  duck  the issue, thinking that Nasir Jahan   a regular radio broadcaster with
  a lovely voice   was unlikely to be great fun for me to meet. His interests, apart
  from Urdu Poetry, were not likely to coincide with mine (or so I thought). His Naats
  were, of course, delightful to listen to on Radio Pakistan and his Nohas and Syed
  Aal  Raza s Salaam at every Muharram were always something I watched when I could.
  I had always thought that was what he was about until I met him later. My friendship
  with the Chittagong poets had developed fairly over the years. Most of them were
  regular visitors to the ships and were always included in the regular Mushaerahs
  that I held. Bangladesh s war brought Asghar Gorakhpuri to Karachi   after having
  been left for dead under various corpses by the Mukti Bahini. His escape tales were
  worth listening to   as were most tales told by him. He was really a fascinating
  story-teller. Asghar Bhai was someone I always loved. Along with him, from Chittagong,
  came Nasir Zaidi (Shohrat) and his friend Kazim  Nudrat  (Kajjoo) Abidi, two young
  poets. Every now and then, we d have Asghar Bhai read out a few of his verses. One
  of my favourite pieces, recorded soon after Bhutto s death, was his Tanha Farishtay
  Ka Noha. On some occasions we d have another friend from Chittagong join us: Kavish
  Umar, who never became popular here. He was a superb poet and wrote often. At one
  Mushaerah in Chittagong, with Comodore Asif Alvi presiding, the first few poets
  did not turn up. Each name was called and there was no one to answer. (The reason
  was a little political problem. We have those in Mushaerahs just as we have them
  in our Cricket teams being selected.) The crowd was seemingly getting angry. Zaheer
  and Nuzhat Kidvai Asif Alvi Mamoo    my mother s second cousin   decided to call
  Kavish to the microphone in the hope that he would be able to keep the crowd quiet.
  In the beginning Kavish was upset to have been called to the Mushaaerah   but Asif
  Mamoo  was his boss! So he came up to the microphone and said,  I have just a qata  that
  I wrote a few minutes ago. Here it is.  Karay  to kis say karay  jabr  bandigi ka
  gilah, S nay to kaun s nay shikva  dil  naashaad, Sar  niyaaz jh kaa  kahaa  kahaa
  , Kavish, Falak peh ayk kh daa ha , zamee  peh laa-taadaad (who should we complain
  to about the pains of bondage who will listen to the plight of our unhappy heart
  Kavish, how many people will you bow your proud head to there s one God in the Heavens,
  but countless on earth) He then left the stage amidst tons of people clapping and
  wanting him to come back but he left the place to go home. True Kavish! Kavish was
  a strong Muslim but had very Leftist tendencies. Yet, he was very anti-Faiz and
  often wrote verses that were against Faiz s philosophy. The day that Asghar Bhai
  arrived in Karachi, he came to see me. He had a close friendship with Nasir Jahan   and
  that meant that we were all soon meeting (specially with Shohrat & Kajjoo) at our
  place. My first meeting with Nasir Bhai stole my heart. Here was a man who was a
  wonderful conversationalist, adored classical music, totally in love with Urdu prose
  and poetry, recited beautiful verses, specially poems and anecdotes of Arzoo Lakhnavi
  and Josh Malihabadi. He loved many of my English books that I very rarely found
  other people reading. His wit and sarcasm were superb. And he loved the food at
  our house! During my days in the Merchant Navy I was posted to Hong Kong for a while,
  relieving an officer in Gokal s GESL. When Eed-e-Meelaad-un-Nabi was a month away
  I was asked by NBP s Mushtaque Sahab to help him get someone from Karachi to come
  and be part of the Pakistani celebrations. Nasir Bhai s name cropped up in my mind
  and Mushtaque Sahab was thrilled. I phoned Nasir Bhai, asking him to come over to
  Hong Kong. It took a lot of convincing, since he hated flying.  I have been scared
  of it all the time , he told me. Finally, three phone calls later, I got him to
  agree to come over and he was part of the Meelaad celebrations. We also managed
  to convince him to recite various verses (including a Manqibat to Hazrat Ali   from
  Ghalib) at a local club, with me reciting a couple of mine in between his readings,
  too. A few years later Nasir Bhai, Asghar Bhai, and I had a radio broadcast (called
  Baat-say-Baat) which was the only piece from the series that Nasir Bhai did that
  was played twice again by public demand! There are so many things I recall about
  Nasir Bhai, Asghar Bhai, Shohrat and Kajjoo. Our wonderful days together. The craziest
  nights out that lasted until the early hours of the morning. Tons of poetry. Many
  stories. Asghar Bhai & Nasir Bhai had remarkable memories of the old poets, their
  writings, their lives, and we were always thrilled to hear not just their verses
  but also the anecdotes that both told. We d all go to meet visiting poets at public
  gatherings and bundle them into our car to bring them home for the night. One was
  Muzaffar Warsi. I had met him when he carried a bunch of Currency Notes on the  M.V.
  Shams  to Chittagong. I was walking past the open door of his cabin when I heard
  sounds of a lovely recitation. I walked in and told him that it was great and he
  said  I am a theek thaak poet . The first qata  that he then recited for me was
  something I always remember: Zindagi kee qabaa ka har t k?aa Vaqt kay pa rahan me  taaNkaa
  ha  A  zaamaanah, hamay  d aa  day Tayree  ryaanio  ko dhaaNka ha  Muzaffar Bhai
  always came to meet me whenever he arrived in Karachi. I miss his voice. Among my
  favourite pieces from him was his Ya Rahmat-ul Lil Aalamee . Among others who came
  often to the Iqbal Town house were people whose poems I also recorded there: Himayat
  Ali Sha r, Mohsin Ehsan, Naseer Turabi, Havi (from Quetta), Mohsin Bhopali, Athar
  Nafees, and Peerzada Qasim. =============== Suroor Barabankvi left this world in
  1980. We all miss him an awful lot. He reminds me most of all of his shayr that
  said: Jin se mil kar zindagi say ishq ho jaae, voh log Aap nay shaayad nah daykhay
  ho , magar a say bhi hae ! ================ I was in a hospital in London, going
  through a surgery. During a heavily-dosed period on the first day I saw Asghar Bhai
  walking in and saying he was there to see me. I asked Nuzhat when I woke up if Asghar
  Bhai had come, and she said I had obviously been dreaming. I said once I am went
  back to in Karachi in two weeks I d ask Asghar Bhai to come every day and keep me
  company while I am recuperating in bed. When I arrived in Karachi, my cousin Naz
  (who was staying at our house) asked me if there are two Asghar Gorakhpuris. I said,  Of
  course not!    and she brought out a Jang Newspaper that said Asghar Gorakhpuri
  was dead! I was dumbfounded. I rang up his Brother-in-Law, a fellow Master in the
  Merchant Navy, and he said Asghar Bhai had died of a heart attack when Shohrat and
  Kajjoo were visiting him at home. Nuzhat took the car out and I, lying in the back
  with great difficulty, went to his house. Asghar Bhai had died within minutes of
  the time that I remember seeing him in hospital! Even stranger, he gave some of
  his writings to Nasir and told him to give them to me, instructing him to write  Zaheer  in
  the corner  with a zay  because he thought Nasir would write it with a  zoay  like
  most people. He took a sip of water after that remark   and was no more! (Sadly,
  despite all this, I don t  believe  in the Supernatural) Kavish Umar, for reasons
  best known to him, disappeared from our lives. He used to live in Orangi Town. I
  had  no idea where he went. Neither did Shohrat or Kajjoo. (Last year I discovered
  he had had a heart attack and didn t go anywhere. I visited him and his poet-daughter,
  Sahar, and called them over to T2F). Nasir Bhai phoned me from Islamabad and said
  he was coming to Karachi and that I should ask Nuzhat to make his favourite Kabaabs
  and Kheer and that he would come with Shohrat. When Nuzhat came back from the office
  the next day, she asked if I knew about Nasir Bhai. I said he d be there for dinner
  tonight and that she had to make some food for him. She said she d just heard on
  the radio in the car that he was dead and the body would be coming by the flight
  he was to come by. Shohrat and I reached the graveyard and waited for his body that
  was coming from the airport. We buried him and I cried an awful lot. A lot more
  than I had for anyone in years. Shohrat died 2 years ago, just a few weeks after
  I had attended his child s wedding. Kajjoo had been ill for a while. He was bedridden
  often. One day he phoned me to say he was feeling a lot better and would come to
  see me soon.  Do you have some old Chittagong Mushaerahs that we could play?  he
  asked. I said I did have a few. Three days later his daughter phoned me to say that
  Kajjoo had passed away. Their recitations that I have on tape are my only connect
  with a beautiful past. A version of this post was first published online on Zaheer
  Kidvai s blog. It contains audio recordings of many of the poems and poets mentioned
  in the article. The blogpost can be accessed here: http://kidvai.blogspot.com/2011/12/some-memories.html '

  to go along with NAB.  Collective punishment In the aftermath of a leaked video
  of PAT s Khurram Nawaz Gandapur berating and threatening female students of Minhaj
  University, Daily Express (28 May 2018) reported that some 320 of the students were
  expelled from the hostels of that institution. According to the report, the female
  students were given until the end of the month to clear out.  It has been foreseen  Sheikh

  was quoted by Daily Express (29 May 2018) as saying that the security staff did
  not know that the relationship between her father and the people (awam) was that
  of lovers (ashiq mashuq ka rishta).  Visionary in retirement? Daily Express (29
  May 2018) reported that former Pakistani spy chief General (R.) Asad Durrani had,
  in his controversial book appearance alongside his Indian counterpart, proposed
  the creation of a South Asian Confederation. He suggested that there be moves towards
  the creation of a union along the lines of the European Union, and eventually in
  100 years there could be some form of political unification.  Ooops Rishi Kapoor,
  according to Daily Jang (30 May 2018), while viewing the trailer for film Sanju,
  was so convinced by his son Ranbir Kapoor s acting that he actually mistook him
  for veteran actor Sanjay Dutt himself.  Far-reaching impact The leader of the Pak
  Sarzamin Party (PSP), Mustafa Kamal, was quoted by Daily Dunya (02 June 2018) as
  expressing his view that the upcoming elections will decide the fate of the next
  7 generations to come.  Elections on the Nile Egyptian president Abdel Fateh el-Sisi,

  ceremony in Moscow on Thursday, the world football governing body FIFA and the singer''s
  representatives said.  The award-winning singer formerly in the band Take That,
  who is best known for his hit single "Angels", will sing alongside Russian soprano
  Aida Garifullina shortly before Russia and Saudi Arabia kick off the World Cup at
  Moscow s Luzhniki Stadium. The 44-year-old said in a statement on Monday that performing
  at the World Cup was "a boyhood dream" and it would be "an unforgettable show".
  His song "Party Like a Russian" two years ago sparked controversy in Russia for
  promoting stereotypes about the country. It included lyrics about a leader who "alleviates
  the cash from a whole entire nation, takes loose change and builds his own space
  station". Williams told fans on Twitter at the time that the song "is definitely
  not about (Russian President Vladimir) Putin". Last year, he offered to represent
  Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest in a jokey interview on Russian state-controlled
  Channel One television. Williams told Andrei Malakhov, the host of the show "Pust
  Govoryat" or "Let Them Talk", in comments dubbed into Russian: "I''d like to represent
  Russia at Eurovision. Come on Russia, we can win!" Williams grinned as he made the
  offer, adding however that he could see his manager "has already got his head in
  his hands". Former Brazil striker Ronaldo -- known as "O Fenomeno" -- will also
  be taking part in the opening ceremony, FIFA said. '

text: 'ASMARA: When Ethiopia and Eritrea went to war in 1998 and deported each other
  s nationals en masse, Addisalem Hadgu thought he had nothing to worry about, safe
  in the belief his Ethiopian passport would shield his Eritrean wife from expulsion.  Two
  years later, as the conflict raged on in trenches along the common border, his wife,
  Nitslal Abraha, mysteriously disappeared along with their two daughters. Addisalem,
  an Ethiopian state TV journalist, embarked on a frantic search. A neighbour approached
  him several days later and handed him a letter from Nitslal in which she said she
  had left for Eritrea with Azmera and Danayt, who were teenagers at the time. The
  letter did not explain her reasons but Addisalem suspected that she, like millions
  of others on both sides of the conflict, had been swept by the patriotism and nationalism
  that engulfed both countries as bloodshed escalated.  One day, we may meet,  the
  letter read. For 18 years, they didn t. There was no way to communicate   all transport
  links, phone, and postal services had been severed since the start of the conflict.
  But this month, a reunion became possible when the two governments   bitter enemies
  for nearly two decades despite agreeing on a ceasefire back in 2000   signed a peace
  deal that ended a generation of hostility in a matter of days. After Eritrean President
  Isaias Afwerki and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed shook hands, hugged, and
  pledged to restore ties, Addisalem was among more than 400 passengers who flew to
  Asmara on Wednesday on the first direct flight between the Horn of Africa neighbours
  since 1998. Only months earlier, he had given up hope of a reunion. Over the years
  he had tried to reach out, including a request to the International Committee of
  the Red Cross to find his wife s contacts, but to no avail. He even considered travelling
  to Eritrea through Sudan with the help of people smugglers but was advised against
  the trip because of the exorbitant cost and risks to his safety.  Everything discouraged
  you. I used to ask myself whether I was going to be deprived of seeing my family
  (again) because I did not have enough money,  said the 58-year-old Addisalem. Ululations
  and toothache While his friends tracked down his eldest daughter Azmera through
  Facebook and he exchanged messages over the last two years, Addisalem often found
  himself distraught over his inability to speak to her in person.  I collapsed and
  blanked one day,  he told Reuters a day after his arrival in Asmara.  I could not
  control myself. I stopped speaking to her as I just could not take it any more.  As
  the pledge to restore Ethiopian-Eritrean ties gathered pace and the possibility
  of a rapprochement grew over the months of June and July, he contacted her again.
  They agreed to meet at the home of a relative. On Thursday, outside a small brick
  house in Asmara s Geza Banda  Tilyan district, Addisalem was received to ululations
  and cheers. Husband, wife, and daughters embraced for the first time in 18 years.
  Initially, it was only small talk.  I came despite a toothache,  he told her.  I
  am a bit ill as well,  Nitslal responded. He then broke down in tears as his daughters
  hugged him.  It was years of darkness. The separation and longing was unthinkable.
  Imagine someone who just won a lottery. That is how I feel now,  Addisalem said,
  lamenting the long and bitter price paid by ordinary people on both sides of the
  conflict.  This was unnecessary. I lost my family because of it. We all fought in
  it one way or another.  His other daughter, Danayt, could scarcely believe she was
  seeing her father again.  He might be sitting next to me now but I am still horrified
  that I might lose him again,  she said. Overcome by emotion, Addisalem sidestepped
  any questions about the past, including why his wife had left with their two daughters,
  although their son had remained with him. With the thaw between Ethiopia and Eritrea
  still in its infancy, it was unclear where the family would end up living. Addisalem
  just looked to the future.  I do not care now,  he said.  I have turned my back
  on the past and will enjoy the future with my daughters.  '

  \   PESHAWAR: Three major political parties operating in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday\
  \ warned that any change in the route for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)\
  \ would lead to a political crisis in the country.Addressing a seminar on the CPEC\
  \ organised by the Ulasi Tehrik at the Peshawar Press Club, top-tier leadership\
  \ of Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) Aftab Sherpao, and Sikandar Khan Sherpao, provincial\
  \ chief of Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Prof Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, JI\u2019s former member\

  \ in the provincial assembly Sardar Hussain Babak urged the federal government to\
  \ refrain from making any change to the CPEC route as it would lead to severe political\
  \ turmoil.After a detailed briefing on the CPEC by Dr Said Alam Mehsud, chairman\
  \ of the Ulasi Tehrik, QWP head Aftab Sherpao asked the federal government to stick\
  \ to its decision that it took during the All Parties Conference (APC) on the route\
  \ of the corridor on May 28 in Islamabad.He said the APC chaired by Prime Minister\
  \ Nawaz Sharif in Islamabad had reached a consensus over the route. \u201CIf that\
  \ consensus decision was changed, all the political parties of Pakhtuns would raise\
  \ voice against it,\u201D he cautioned.He said Pakhtuns would not tolerate any injustice\
  \ in the allocation of resources and selection of route for the $46 billion CPEC\
  \ project. \u201CIt (CPEC) is a matter of life and death for Pakhtuns and they will\
  \ not compromise on it,\u201D Aftab Sherpao added.The QWP leader said that Pakhtuns\
  \ had suffered a lot over the last few decades and they were still facing numerous\
  \ hardships. He added that more than 60,000 people had laid down their lives for\
  \ the motherland and the time had come to treat all the communities in the country\
  \ equally.He asserted that political parties representing the Pakhtuns were in no\
  \ mood to make this project (CPEC) controversial as it has offered a huge opportunity\
  \ to change the destiny of the country. Prof Ibrahim Khan said the route first identified\
  \ for the project should have been built as it was important for the development\
  \ of the region, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said the enemies of Pakistan\
  \ were out to foil the project. If it happened and the project could not be initiated,\
  \ both Pakistan and China would face huge losses, Prof Ibrahim added. The JI provincial\
  \ head said the federal government should evolve national consensus on the project.Using\
  \ tough language, ANP\u2019s Mian Iftikhar Hussain said it would be tantamount to\
  \ the \u201Ceconomic murder\u201D of Pakhtuns if the route for the CPEC was changed.He\
