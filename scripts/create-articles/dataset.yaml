text: '  If I came to know that only 10 minutes of my life are left, I will prefer
  to spend them serving humanity.  These were the words which Dr Ruth Pfau often said
  to people around her. Dr Pfau was not born in Pakistan but the selfless work she
  did for her adopted country in unmatchable. It is her selfless and untiring efforts
  that Pakistan has become one of the first Asian countries to eradicate leprosy in
  1996, four years ahead of the target set by World Health Organisation (WHO). Pakistan
  s efforts in successfully eradicating leprosy make the world believe that Pakistan
  will be able to successfully eradicate polio as well, but it did not realise that
  there is no one like Dr Pfau attached with polio eradication efforts in the country
  and in the absence of dedicated personnel, Pakistan is hampering the efforts of
  polio s global eradication. Dr Pfau was born in Germany s city of Leipzig and faced
  tough situation from her childhood including but not limited to war, poverty, hunger
  and deaths of loved ones. Instead of cowing down under the burden of her problems,
  she became more resilient and it is this resilience that helped her taking up tough
  tasks with a smiling face. Dr Pfau never hesitated to travel out of Karachi during
  her struggle against leprosy. She visited far-flung areas of the country and unearthed
  many patients who were abandoned by their families and were living in miserable
  conditions  Dr Pfau was working in France but Daughters of the Heart of Mary Foundation
  wanted her to go to India and work there, but her destiny was Pakistan; she was
  unable to get India s visa on time and instead traveled to Pakistan. In Pakistan,
  she stayed with Sister Bernice Vargas a Mexican Sister who was working on rehabilitation
  of leprosy patients in the country since 1955. It was Sister Vargas who took Dr
  Ruth to the Leper s Colony located at II Chundrigar Road (McLeod Road of yesteryears)
  and on seeing the suffering of people from Leprosy, she quashed her plan of going
  to India and decided to stay in Pakistan, to serve the ones unserved who no one
  else would ever serve. She being the moving spirit of the Leprosy Control Programme
  in Pakistan, worked desperately to remove the public s fear of Leprosy. Dr Ruth
  Pfau s initial medical centre was a small hut made of straws and bamboos. As a result
  of funding from Germany, she was able to establish a medical centre. It was the
  first proper medical facility in Pakistan to treat leprosy and attracts patients
  in large numbers from all parts of the country. In 1961, Dr Pfau visited India for
  a few months for training purposes about Leprosy s treatment. Dr Pfau through her
  and her team s untiring efforts was able to change the stereotype about leprosy
  patients and created awareness among masses that leprosy patients should not be
  thrown in to wilderness but instead steps should be taken to treat their disease
  and an opportunity provided to live normal life. Dr Pfau never hesitated to move
  out of Karachi and during her struggle against leprosy, she went to far flung areas
  of the country and unearthed many patients who were abandoned by their families
  and were living miserable conditions in deserted caves. She was a visionary person
  who was fully aware of this disease, which is why she not only treated the patients
  but also performed medical examinations of their families. During these medical
  examinations, many probable patients were found who were given adequate treatment
  well in advance. Poverty, lack of knowledge about the disease and fear were the
  main reasons of leprosy s presence in Pakistan. Dr Pfau tackled these hangovers
  brilliantly. She took the initiative of compiling data of leprosy patients of Pakistan
  and on the basis of that data, she took decisions about her target areas. Dr.Pfau
  also laid the foundation of the National Training Institute of Leprosy in 1965.
  Paramedics after gaining training from this institute go to various parts of the
  country to treat leprosy patients.  Along with leprosy, Dr Pfau and her team also
  treated few other diseases including Tuberculosis and eye ailments. A lot of people
  declare Dr Ruth Pfau as Mother Teresa of Pakistan but if we genuinely review the
  difficult circumstances faced by Dr Pfau, I can surely say that she is neck and
  crop above Mother Teresa. The respect and honour that Dr Ruth Pfau received from
  all quarters was commendable but her legacy should remain with us forever. It is
  now our responsibility to make sure that Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre continues
  to serve humanity without any hindrance. As the centre s funding from outside Pakistan
  is declining, it is appropriate for the locals to gear up their efforts for the
  welfare of this centre. Dr Ruth Pfau is a national hero. People like her are born
  in centuries. To commemorate her services, a chapter about her should be included
  in our national curriculum to not only keep reminding all of us about her services
  but also to inculcate the love for humanity among our future generation. Also, I
  hope someone someday makes a movie on Dr Pfau s life and highlights her services
  and personality traits for all to know.   The writer is a publicist and an avid
  reader of books, newspapers and periodicals. He is also an ardent sports follower.

text: ' The recently concluded BRICS Summit hosted by Beijing turned out to be nightmare
  for Pakistani authorities who were already in a state of shock over the withdrawal
  of the Chinese and Indian forces from the much hyped Doklam zone. The latter marked
  not only strategic and diplomatic maturity on the behalf of both Chinese and Indian
  top leadership, it also paved the way for Indian Prime Minister Modi to attend the
  mentioned summit of these five emerging regional economies. The BRICS Summit Declaration
  dropped bricks on Pakistan for the latter, though not mentioned by name, was held
  responsible for hosting (banned) militant organisations such as Jaish-e-Muhammad
  (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Such organisations, believed to have been involved
  in terror attacks on the US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, had already received
  censure from the US and its allies only recently. The summit declaration not only
  confirmed what the Trump administration echoed but also highlighted the need to
  eradicate terrorism from the South Asian region with geographical proximity with
  both Russia and China. The latter are on the same page on fighting terrorism on
  their territory and, to some extent, neighbourhood. The Russians, for instance,
  launched many a military operation to curb militancy in Chechnya. China, on its
  part, views the Central Asian militant organisations as a threat to its southwestern
  region. In fact, one of the purposes of the proposed economic corridors, of which
  CPEC is one, is to help the underdeveloped regions such as Xinjiang develop socioeconomically
  and, thus, shun violent means for negotiation with Beijing. In other words, it is
  not necessarily the Indian pressure that made the BRICS, in particular, and China,
  in general, mention Pakistan based militant elements. However, India, of course,
  would have pushed China and Russia to pursue such a policy (dis)course which, if
  seen holistically, befit their respect domestic policy on military threats from
  the non-state actors. Our civil-military leadership ought to assume the Chinese
  post-BRICS declaration statement favouring Pakistan objectively, as they might serve
  only diplomatic purposes and mean little in concrete terms Moreover, by having resolved
  Doklam issue with India, China s regional policy has reflected bias in favor of
  geo-economics than geo-politics. In order to sustain and enhance its economic growth
  along with feeding its huge population, Beijing is not, and has never been, in the
  mood to enter into conflict or war with, for example, India or the US. Nor do the
  latter wish to waste resources in any unnecessary war with China. Rather, India
  wants to excel in, for example, manufacturing sector and export goods to China than
  to stay on as a recipient of cheap Chinese products. At the moment, the balance
  of trade is heavily in favour of China where the latter gets ca. 80 billion US$
  as compared with India s share of around 8 billion US dollars. Besides, China is
  projecting itself as an economic (and, to some extent, military) power to the world
  particular US, Japan and other rivals. From this logic, it is against China s long
  term strategic interest to keep supporting Pakistan over terrorism related matters.
  In the United Nations, where the NATO countries, Japan, South Korea, India, Brazil,
  Germany, and, now, the US is likely to press for hard measures against individuals,
  groups and states believed to have been involved or supportive of terrorism, will
  it be feasible and rational for China, if not Russia, to offend all these countries,
  with whom it trades in billions, for the sake of Pakistan? That must be challenging
  question for Pakistani leadership, though the Chinese did provide us with their
  answer to it. We should stay mindful of these developments and never get carried
  away by emotions. Last but not the least, our civil-military leadership ought to
  assume the Chinese statement favouring Pakistan post-BRICS Declaration objectively
  as they might serve only diplomatic purpose and mean little in concrete terms. Nevertheless,
  this is not to suggest China-Pakistan relationship is over or Pakistan should disengage
  with Beijing. Rather, our side must try to understand China as China understands
  itself. It is a tough task which requires skills, resources, will and, importantly,
  space for independent and critical research done conceptually and empirically. Unfortunately,
  we as a state and society failed to produce more than two China scholars in past
  70 years and miserably failed to establish China focused think tank. The so-called
  China centres mushrooming these days are but shops to sell poorly research content
  in exchange for some RMB. By contrast, India is way ahead in this respect and is
  getting benefited. The end to Doklam standoff is just one example. It is time Pakistan
  s foreign policy is shaped by its well-trained scholars than semi-educated televangelists
  and people with a fixed mindset. Until this happens, bricks will continue to fall
  on us from here and there.    The writer is Head, Department of Social Sciences,

  millisecond to flick off a light switch and what harm could it possibly do to you
  if a room you re not in is dark? This is an efficient way to save energy, which
  leads to a drop in need for energy production, which means less harmful gases are
  emitted into the air. Carpool whenever possible  Who doesn t love a karaoke car
  ride with their friends and/or family? So why not have a blast on your commute and
  save the environment at the same time. If you re going to the same place at the
  same time, suggest carpooling and go together. Even if just one of your friends
  lives in an area where it ll be feasible, the toxic fumes from that one car not
  being released into the atmosphere will make a great difference.  Use a glass of
  water instead of running water while brushing your teeth  Even though turning the
  tap off while brushing your teeth is an extremely plain sailing thing to do, for
  some reason, people just don t seem to do it. So instead, before brushing your teeth,
  fill up a glass with water and use that to rinse your mouth. The tap will be closed
  from the beginning and you won t need to open it again either. Use biodegradable
  cleaning products  Instead of buying household cleaning products, use eco-friendly
  products which, when released into the air, will cause negligible damage to the
  environment along with saving your money! Some examples include items like distilled
  vinegar and baking soda. Keep a reusable water bottle in your bag at all times  If
  a bottle is always in your bag then no effort will be needed to find it and put
  it in your bag each time you leave the house. You can use this bottle to fill with
  water, coffee or any other drink you buy, for example, at a coffee shop. Like this,
  you ll avoid using plastic cups and hence lessen the non-biodegradable waste lying
  around on the planet.  4Shares        4Shares 4 Shares   '

text: ' Today marks the 91st birthday of the legend, Mehdi Hassan, one of the greatest
  and most influential figures in the history of ghazal singing. He is famously known
  as  Shahanshah e Ghazal.  His immense contribution to Pakistani and North Indian
  music earned him a great number of admirers from all over the subcontinent. His
  mellow, velvety baritone voice attracted a following, first in the subcontinent
  and then in the world. He earned numerous awards and accolades in his lifetimes
  and remained a leading singer in the Pakistani singing industry. Mehdi Hassan was
  born on the 18th of July 1927 in a village called Luna in Jhunjhunu District in
  British India into a family of musicians. He had his musical training from his father,
  Ustad Azeem Khan and uncle Ustad Ismail Khan. Mehdi Hassan started performing from
  a very young age with his brother.   When Pakistan came into existence, at the age
  of twenty Mehdi Hassan migrated to the new country with his family. He had to face
  great financial problems and he initially started working in a bicycle shop and
  later became a car and diesel tractor mechanic. For several years the majestic voice
  remained unheard. Despite the poor financial condition, he didn t give up on his
  passion and continued his singing routine on daily basis. In 1957, he was given
  the opportunity to sing on the Radio Pakistan, which earned him great recognition.
  He began experimenting with Urdu ghazals because of his love for Urdu poetry, during
  his part time job. His first major breakthrough was when he sang a ghazal for the
  film,  Firangi , called  Gulon mein rang bharay, baad-e-naubahar chale,  written
  by the legendary Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Then there was no one stopping the shooting success
  of his singing career. He gave us back to back many enchanting songs and ghazals
  that connected to the hearts of people and evoked a series of emotions. Zindagi
  Mein Toh Sabhi Pyar kiya Kerte Hain It is one of the most famous ghazals of Mehdi
  Hassan. It appeared in the film,  Azmat , in 1973. It talks about the true, undying
  love and affection.   Zindagi mein to sabhi pyar kiya kartay hain (everyone loves
  in their lifetime) Mein to mar kar bhi meri jaan tujhay chahoon gaa (But I will
  yearn for you even after I die). Mein Khayal Hoon Kisi Aur Ka  Mein khayal hoon
  kisi aur ka (I am somebody else s thought)  Mujhe sochta koi aur hai (but being
  thought by someone else) Hassan s gossamer light reading runs the scale with effortless
  ease giving a release from rather intense lyrics. Critics and fans have been marveled
  at Hassan s ability to sing with such ease and lightness.   Ranjish He Sahi One
  of the most acknowledged ghazals sung by him. Many remakes have immerged in order
  to pay a tribute to Mehdi Hassan. Despite the fact all are a product of great efforts,
  but none of those are even close to be compared to the one sung by the legend himself.  Ranjish
  he sahi, dil he dukhnae k liye aa (let it be anguish, even to torture my heart,
  come) Aa phir se mujhe chor k jaane k liye aa (come even if to abandon me, torment
  me)   Mein hosh mein tha  Mein hosh mein tha (if I was in abstinence) Tou phir mar
  gaya kaisay (then how come I died of beloved s stupor)   Rafta Rafta  Rafta Rafta
  Wo Meri Hasti Ka Saman Ho Gaye  (Subtly and gradually, she became a part of my personality)   Pehle
  Jaan Phir Jaan-e-jaan Phir Jaan-e-jaana Ho Gay (First my life, then the love of
  my life, then she became the beloved of my life) As ever Mehdi Hassan s singing
  seems to flow from within as if its source is an eternal spring. He was a recipient
  of many deserving awards from India, Pakistan and Nepal. Mehdi Hassan passed away
  on the 13th of June 2012 at Aga Khan University and Hospital, Karachi. By the time
  he breathed his last words, he had a huge fan following who loved and cherished
  him. Mehdi Hassan may not be with us, but his repertoire will continue to enthrall
  music lovers in all times to come.  13Shares        13Shares 13 Shares   '

text: "LAHORE, May 8: The chief justice of the Lahore High Court will take up the\
  \ Pakistan Lawyers Forum (PLF) petition seeking trial of President Gen Musharraf\
  \ on high treason charges on Friday (today).Earlier, the LHC office had objected\
  \ to the petition on some \u2018technical\u2019 grounds and PLF president A. K.\
  \ Dogar filed it afresh contending that only a court could raise objections on a\
  \ petition and the LHC office did not have the jurisdiction to do so.The petition\
  \ is based on the recent press statement of Gen Musharraf in which he had said that\
  \ he would continue to hold both offices of the COAS and the president simultaneously\
  \ since in this manner he could manage the state affairs quite easily.The petitioner\
  \ raised the point that the Supreme Court in judgments delivered in the Zafar Ali\
  \ Shah and Wasim Sajjad cases had clearly laid down that Gen Musharraf would have\
  \ to relinquish the office of COAS after handing over the power to the civilians\
  \ within three years commencing from October 12, 1999. According to the petitioner,\
  \ the power had not been transferred as yet despite holding of general election.\

  \ in the FIR lodged with Mandi Bahauddin police that Mumtaz Bibi had an abortion.Justice\
  \ Tassadaq Hussain Jilani warned Jehan Khan of being tried on charges of making\
  \ a false statement before the court.Justice Jilani observed that there was no documentary\
  \ evidence on the record to substantiate the allegation that Mumtaz Bibi had abortion\
  \ when she was five-month pregnant.There was no point in pressing for a frivolous\
  \ complaint against the girl who was divorced by Jehan Khan on March 21, 2001, and\
  \ now married to another man.\u201CThe FIR and the subsequent complaints lodged\
  \ with the judicial officers appear to be an attempt to enter into meaningless litigation\
  \ on part of Jehan Khan which can not be allowed at the expense of one\u2019s dignity,\u201D\
  \ Justice Jilani further ruled.Earlier, Mumtaz Bibi\u2019s counsel argued that his\
  \ client was implicated in a case and her former husband was trying to drag her\
  \ in a useless matter.To a court query, the counsel submitted that Jehan Khan was\
  \ a drug-addict and did nothing to earn his living. Rather he had been forcing his\
  \ former wife to ask her parents to support him.Jehan Khan, who claimed to be a\
  \ tenant, argued that he married Mumtaz seven years ago when she was only eight-year-old.\
  \ He further claimed that he took full care of his wife till he divorced her at\
  \ the age of 13.He alleged that she had an abortion and a local lady doctor confirmed\
  \ this to him after which he lodged an FIR in April 2000 with the police.He filed\
  \ a private complaint with the judicial magistrate who dismissed it. Later, he filed\
  \ a complaint before the additional district and sessions judge who summoned his\
  \ former wife in this case.Mumtaz Bibi moved the LHC against the orders of the AD&SJ.;Hashmi\

  Sources privy to the development told Dawn that the SSP had mentioned in the inquiry\

  \ the murder of Bhola. However, Rana told the SSP that he was in Lahore on that\
  \ day and his cell phone location was a proof. The SSP had sought the call data\
  \ of Rana Sana\u2019s cell phone number to verify his claim, however, data was not\
  \ found.Statements of Bhola murder case applicant, Mohammad Ashraf, and witnesses\
  \ Aamir Bashir, Mubin Arshad and Mohammad Ashraf had confirmed that Rana Sana was\

  \ as ringleader of the target killers\u2019 gang, used to visit his outhouse along\
  \ with Commando and two gunmen Tahir and Najeebullah. Waheed had been financially\
  \ supporting Commando who was living at the outhouse of Waheed along with his family.He\
  \ told the SSP that Commando had never visited the outhouse of Rana Sanaullah.Concluding\
  \ the case of Khurram alias Khurmi Bajwa, the inquiry officer mentioned that Rana\
  \ Sana had denied having any kind of relations with Commando and that allegations\
  \ against him (Rana) are baseless and fake. The SSP noted that murder case of Bajwa\
  \ was registered on the application of his wife Shazia Bibi on Nov 10, 2012 against\
  \ three persons \u2014 Naziran Bibi, Khalid and Noor Zaman -- with Factory Area\

  \ never tortured Commando during the investigation. A Counter Terrorism Department\
  \ Inspector, Aamir Mushtaq, supported the statement of abovementioned police officers\
  \ and categorically said they never tortured Commando during his detention at the\

  \ of Anjum Niaz, Nafees alias Goga and Tahir (all convicted in the Bhola murder\

text: ' NAB, FIA and the Courts are making headlines every day. What s the message?
  On the eve of the election of the PM in the National Assembly, Asif Zardari s business
  partner Anwar Majeed et al were arrested by the FIA in a case of money laundering
  via dozens of fake bank accounts after the Supreme Court denied them pre-arrest
  bail. This spells trouble for the PPP. Earlier, Mr Zardari and his sister Feryal
  Talpur s lawyer had to submit to some harsh questioning in the same case by the
  SC, suggesting that both are living on borrowed time. The PMLN is also on the spot.
  Fawad Hasan Fawad, the civil servant who has served both brothers Shahbaz Sharif
  and Nawas Sharif by turns, is already in NAB custody. So, too, is another civil
  servant, Ahad Cheema, who was close to ex-CM Shahbaz Sharif and lorded it over the
  Lahore Development Authority which is the hot spot under scrutiny for corrupt land
  grabs. Now comes the news that Ali Siddiqui, the PMLN-appointed Pakistan Ambassador
  to Washington, has been summoned again to appear before NAB in a case for investigation
  initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. Not to be forgotten
  is PMLN stalwart and ex-Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique whose hand is perceived
  in dubious land deals under investigation. A far more sinister move centers on the
  outcome of the Model Town police massacre in June 2014 in which another civil servant,
  Dr Tauqeer Shah, who was close to ex-CM Shahbaz Sharif, is being grilled with the
  aim of implicating the Sharifs. Meanwhile, the shoddy treatment being meted out
  to ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should not be missed. The courts from top to bottom
  have treated him harshly by denying him a fair hearing in due process. To add insult
  to injury, the spectacle of dragging a popular ex-Prime Minister to court in an
  SUV used for transporting high value terrorists is meant to reinforce the same message.
  The message to both PPP and PMLN is: Behave or else. Dutifully, the PPP has refused
  to cooperate with the PMLN in Punjab and Islamabad. In Punjab, the two could have
  jointly wooed the Independents and cobbled a coalition government led by the PMLN
  but the PTI was handed the coveted prize when the PPP announced its decision not
  to join hands with the PMLN. Indeed, the PPP went so far as to even deny support
  to the PMLN nominee for the Speaker of the Punjab Assembly. Much the same sort of
  non-cooperative stance has prevailed in Islamabad. The PPP has refused to stand
  with Shahbaz Sharif on fielding him as their joint candidate for prime ministership  despite
  the fact that the PMLN supported the PPP in fielding its Syed Khurshid Shah as their
  joint candidate for Speakership. Indeed, the PPP was conspicuous by its silence
  when the PMLN protested in parliament after the election of the PTI Speaker. It
  is significant that the PPP has changed its stance of joining hands with the PMLN
  to make a strong opposition in Punjab and Islamabad following the overnight trials
  and tribulations of Mr Zardari, Feryal Talpur and Anwar Majeed. No less significant
  is the stance adopted by Shahbaz Sharif which is at odds with that of Nawaz Sharif.
  Nawaz wanted his party to make a determined bid to form a government in Punjab and
  a strong, united and vociferous opposition in Islamabad. Yet Shahbaz made no serious
  attempt to woo the Independents or the PPP in Punjab and opted for Islamabad rather
  than Punjab as his home for the next five years. Nor did he whip up crowds to protest
  the shoddy treatment meted out to Nawaz Sharif during his comings and goings to
  NAB courts in police custody. Clearly, he too has got the message to behave or else.
  The media is also in the same boat. As the fate of GEO demonstrates, those channels
  which don t behave and toe the line will be sorted out. The few independent journalists
  left have been gagged by their employers or threatened and browbeaten into submission.
  After successful censorship on Facebook and YouTube, the last frontier on the internet
  of freedom for citizens and political parties   Twitter   is about to fall too.
  Pak Telecom Authority has informed a Senate Standing Committee that Twitter has
  refused to oblige the government s request to block  objectionable commentary targeting
  the state and its institutions . Not unsurprisingly, the PTA told the Committee
  that  the Islamabad High Court is determined to teach Twitter a lesson . The PTI
  is also being  managed  behind the scenes. This much is obvious from the nominations
  approved by Imran Khan for key posts in government and parliament despite popular
  disgruntlement in the party. Indeed, Imran sheepishly shook hands with Mr Zardari
  and Bilawal but not with Shahbaz Sharif. So we now have a loyal government, a loyal
  opposition, a loyal media and a loyal court. All Hail the Chief! '

text: ' The 3-1 win against defending World T20 Champions on their home turf is resounding;
  let s make no mistake about it. It has also helped Pakistan swap places with the
  Windies on the official ICC T20 rankings, with the visitors climbing up to fourth
  place. But more than the surge up the ranking tables, what is more crucial is the
  visible progress that Pakistan are making in their game. Having said that, Pakistan
  still significantly lag behind top T20 sides in terms of batting wherewithal. It
  was because of the team s dominant bowling display, spearheaded by the leg-spinning
  prodigy Shadab Khan, that the batsmen never had to play out of their comfort zone.
  It is that comfort zone of a 110-115 strike rate   for almost all of the batsmen   that
  needs to be revamped for Pakistan to become an all-round formidable T20 outfit,
  not reliant on its bowling unit to win matches all the time. Ahmed Shehzad The way
  modern ODI cricket has evolved, the gap between the approaches for the 50-over and
  20-over formats is also being bridged. It is no surprise, then, that Pakistan s
  ODI squad has most of the same faces and the final 11 would not have any major changes.
  ODI squad for the West Indies series Sarfraz Ahmed (c/wk), Ahmed Shehzad, Asif Zakir,
  Babar Azam, Fahim Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Hasan Ali, Imad Wasim, Junaid Khan, Kamran
  Akmal (wk), Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asghar, Mohammad Hafeez, Shadab Khan, Shoaib
  Malik, Wahab Riaz The two notable changes are Mohammed Amir and Junaid Khan. The
  former, who was officially rested for the T20 series with Chief Selector Inzamam-ul-Haq
  citing fatigue, will in all likelihood be the only inclusion in the starting 11
  outside of those who played the T20 series. Hafeez, who only played the first T20,
  might get a slot as well. His only chance is to replace Fakhar Zaman, and if the
  move goes ahead it would be regressive, despite Zaman s struggles in translating
  his PSL form in international cricket. Hasan Ali The likely starting 11 for the
  first ODI at Providence on Friday would be: Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal, Babar Azam,
  Fakhar Zaman, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Amir,
  Wahab Riaz, Hasan Ali 10 of the 11 played the final two T20s in Trinidad. Again,
  whilst the bowling needs to continue where it left off from the T20 series, the
  onus is on the batting to do more. Kamran Akmal, Ahmed Shehzad and Babar Azam might
  all have impressed   even if inconsistently   in their own ways during the T20 series,
  but none of these is an archetypal limited-overs batsman. Azam, the youngest and
  arguably the most gifted of the trio, can eventually evolve into one, but as things
  stand, his batting lacks the urgency needed in the modern game. His run-a-ball innings
  won t cut it in contests when the batting of the opponents fires up. Shadab Khan
  Both Akmal and Shehzad deserve their call back to the ODIs as well, especially with
  Sharjeel Khan suspended. But unlike the impression that the left-hander gave before
  the spot-fixing scandal, neither of these radiates the vibe that they d be a part
  of the limited-overs setup for the prolonged future, considering their inconsistency.
  Akmal, however, the most aggressive of the current top order can cement his place
  in the near future   with the Champions Trophy coming   with a strong display in
  the three ODIs. He s also the likelier to be dropped compared to Shehzad should
  he fail, considering the baggage of the past and his ordinary fielding skills. Malik
  and Sarfraz do add dynamism to the middle order, but neither is a big-hitter that
  a successful modern-day outfit needs in the middle and lower-middle order. In fact,
  Pakistan are completely devoid of any power-hitters in the current lineup and that
  is a major concern hindering the team s progress. The ODI series would be Sarfraz  first
  as the captain. Let s see what direction he takes after a couple of below par years
  under Azhar Ali. Sarfraz has already proven himself to be a formidable T20 captain
  in the PSL and internationally. One would hope he could replicate that in what should
  be his toughest leadership assignment to date. '

  After this meeting, the POTUS told an aide that he was disappointed at The Man of

  obviously become a prisoner of the state . Then The Man of Steel cancelled another

text: ' General Zia was not the sole criminal. Some of the  founding fathers  of Pakistan
  took the first initiative to Islamize the society and pave the way for state-sponsored
  extremism. The military dictator who toppled the Bhutto government in 1977 only
  carried forward the mission what those reactionaries had begun in 1949. However,
  he saw in it his own survival. Tyranny of majority played its part sixty-five years
  ago suppressing the sane voices that failed to echo outside the four-walls of the
  Constituent Assembly. On March 12, 1949, just five months after the demise of Quaid-e-Azam,
  the rest of  founding fathers  defied the principles the great founder had advocated
  in his lifetime. It was a deliberate attempt to divide the nation on communal lines.
  What they might not have comprehended that their decision would open floodgates
  of misinterpretation and cause exodus of non-Muslim Pakistanis. In 1950, more than
  11 million of the total 76 million Pakistanis were non-Muslims. Now when the population
  has crossed the mark of 180 million, less than seven million non-Muslims live in
  Pakistan. For its movers, which included Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, the Objectives
  Resolution was a great success. The opposition, which included Mian Iftikharuddin,
  had termed it a historic blunder. The  founding fathers  proudly presented the Objectives
  Resolution and got it passed from the Constituent Assembly. They seemed to have
  deviated from the fundamental principle of Muhammad Ali Jinnah that Pakistan would
  not become a theocracy. In 1985, military dictator General Zia made the resolution
  an operative part of the Constitution deleting word  freely  from the clause that
  originally read:  Minorities can freely profess and practice their religion.  Wasim
  Sajjad, who held the portfolio of law minister in Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo
  s cabinet, said it was unclear whether the word was removed deliberately.  We were
  not sure what happened back then, when 8th amendment was passed,  he stated. Asked
  whether he tried to check whether it was an intentional attempt to further subjugate
  the non-Muslim Pakistanis, he explained he could not find any evidence of that.
  Sajjad was one of the architects of the 18th constitutional amendment. Introduced
  in the Constitution during the last People s Party government, the amendment made
  several corrective measures including reinserting the word  freely  in that specific
  clause of the Objectives Resolution. It seems unclear what forced liberal person
  like Liaquat Ali Khan to agree to the Objectives Resolution. On page 47 of his latest
  book  Magnificent Delusion,  former ambassador Husain Haqqani quotes Washington
  Herald on first Pakistani prime minister s social successes. He wrote the US assistant
  secretary of state George McGhee was impressed with Liaquat s ability to consume
  alcoholic drinks without losing sobriety. Sindh deputy speaker Shehla Raza said
  she had researched the topic and found that author of the Objectives Resolution
  was Jamaat-e-Islami founder Mualana Maududi. She said Shabir Ahmed Usmani and Dr
  Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi were the main proponents of the resolution in the constituent
  assembly. Referring to the concept of tyranny of majority, she said the treasury
  members suppressed the voice of opposition in the constituent assembly. Constitutionalist
  Hamid Khan wrote in his book Constitutional and Political History of Pakistan,  It
  is unfortunate that there was a division on the Resolution along communal lines.
  Muslim members voted against the amendments and non-Muslim members voted for the
  amendments. One cannot escape the conclusion that the Resolution might have sown
  the seeds of suspicion, alienation, and distrust among the minorities against the
  majority.  A cursory look on the annals of the debate of constituent assembly on
  the resolution which started on March 9, 1949, and concluded on March 12, would
  reveal how genuine were the fears and concerns of the opposition on the resolution.  My
  fear is real, as these concepts will everywhere be interpreted by much less enlightened
  men. Sir, it would be wiser perhaps for the House, as our Leader suggested the other
  day, to dispense with a Resolution of this nature at this stage,  said opposition
  member Bhupendra Kumar Datta, while taking part in the debate. Another member Prof
  Raj Kumar Chakraverty endorsed his colleague and said:  It has been my conviction
  and it has one of my principles of life that religion is a matter personal to everybody.
  It is a matter private to one s self and if we drag in religion of some other force
  or power in our everyday life, it may lead to endless complications and difficulties  The
  arguments of those two Hindu members incurred sharp criticism from Dr Ishtiaq Qureshi
  and Shabir Usmani. They defended the resolution and brushed aside the arguments
  of the opposition members.  Islam has never accepted the view that religion is a
  private affair between man and his Creator and as such has no bearing upon the social
  of political relations of human beings. Some other religious systems may expound
  this theory and may, incidentally, be too idealistic to possess a comprehensive
  and all-embracing code of life. But Islam has no use for such false notions and
  its teachings are in direct contradiction to them,  maintained Maulana Usmani. Another
  opposition member, Chandra Chattopadhyaya said,  You felt your incapacity to separate
  politics from religion, which the modern world so universally does. You could not
  get over the old world way of thinking. What I hear in this Resolution is not the
  voice of the great creator of Pakistan, nor even that of the Prime Minister of Pakistan,
  but of the Ulemas of the land.  Prominent among the opposition members was Mian
  Iftikharuddin, who argued that only four states had drafted their Constitutions
  in the same way and called themselves Islamic states. He claimed those states including
  Egypt, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan were the most un-Islamic of all the states in
  the world.  These states yet retain the divine right of kings. These states, at
  least three of them, yet claim that the King cannot be deposed.  Prime Minister
  Liaquat Ali Khan, Sardar Abdul Rab Nishtar and ilk defended the resolution and received
  rounds of applause from the treasury benches. However, there was one saner voice
  among them which, in deed, spoiled the party. That was Begum Shaista Ikramullah.  What
  exactly have we achieved? I do not think that for a State where the majority of
  the population is Muslim, it is such a tremendous achievement to have declared that
  the sovereignty of this universe belongs to God alone  I do not think mere declaration
  of it is such a great achievement justifies and orgy of praise we have been giving
  to ourselves.  Her final words are still echoing around and seem to be most relevant
  to the present day Pakistan, where Council of Islamic Ideology is still grappling
  with the question of under-age marriages and permission of first wife to have a
  second one. She concluded:  With great regret I say that it is eighteen months since
  Pakistan has been established, but with great regret I say there are no signs of
  the promises that were made to the people of Pakistan being fulfilled. There has
  been no improvement whatsoever in the conditions of their lives to justify the sacrifices
  they made for the securing of the State. Instead of improvement there is worsening
  of conditions, corruption is rife, black-marketing rampant and misery stalks the
  land.  Shahzad Raza is a journalist based in Islamabad. Follow him on Twitter @shahzadrez '

text: 'ANKARA (AFP): Austria said on Friday it could expel up to 60 Turkish-funded
  imams and their families, and shut down seven mosques as part of a crackdown on  political
  Islam , triggering fury in Ankara.  The circle of people possibly affected by these
  measures   the pool that we re talking about   comprises around 60 imams,  said
  Interior Minister Herbert Kickl of the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe), the junior
  partner in Austria s coalition government. In total, 150 people risked losing their
  right to residence, he said at a press conference in Vienna. Ankara quickly denounced
  the move.  Austria s decision to close down seven mosques and deport imams with
  a lame excuse is a reflection of the anti-Islam, racist and discriminatory populist
  wave in this country,  presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said on Twitter. Seven
  mosques will also be shut after an investigation by the religious affairs authority
  into images which emerged in April of children in a Turkish-backed mosque playing
  dead and reenacting the World War I battle of Gallipoli.  Parallel societies, political
  Islam and radicalisation have no place in our country,  Chancellor Sebastian Kurz
  of the ruling centre-right People s Party said. In several cases, the process of
  expelling imams connected to the Turkish-Islamic Cultural Associations (ATIB) organisation
  was underway, Kickl said. The interior minister added that the government suspects
  them of contravening a ban on foreign funding of religious office holders. ATIB
  is a branch of Turkey s religious affairs agency Diyanet. The photos of children,
  published by the Falter weekly, showed the young boys in camouflage uniforms marching,
  saluting, waving Turkish flags and then playing dead. Their  corpses  were then
  lined up and draped in the flags. The mosque in question was run by ATIB. ATIB itself
  condemned the photos at the time, calling the  highly regrettable  event and said
  that  called off before it had even ended . Turkey s relations with Austria have
  long been strained, with Kurz calling on the European Union to break off negotiations
  on Ankara joining the bloc. Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attacked
  Kurz, saying:  This immoral chancellor has a problem with us .  He s throwing his
  weight around and making a scene,  Erdogan went on. Both Kurz, of the centre-right
  People s Party (OeVP) and the FPOe made immigration and integration major themes
  in their election campaigns last year. In Friday s press conference Kurz was keen
  to emphasise that the action was being taken under legislation to regulate Islamic
  associations that he himself brought in as a minister in the previous government.

text: 'The second match of the 2017 Independence Cup saw the World XI and Pakistan
  resume the action at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Plenty was at stake for both
  the sides. Pakistan were determined to clinch the series while the World XI were
  looking to live up to their billing by putting in a winning performance to keep
  the series alive. Pakistan skipper Sarfraz Ahmed won the toss and opted to bat first.
  Left-arm tweaker Mohammad Nawaz, and promising young pacer Usman Shinwari, came
  into the side for Faheem Ashraf and Hasan Ali, respectively. During this time, the
  World XI chose to bolster their spin bowling options with West Indian T20 specialist
  Samuel Badree coming into the side for his compatriot Darren Sammy. England s 2010
  WT20-winning captain Paul Collingwood also took the place of Grant Elliott, adding
  valuable experience to the team, having already toured Pakistan back in 2006. Dashing
  left-hander Fakhar Zaman once again got fair reward for attacking intent as he put
  the World XI new ball bowlers to the sword. While Aussie all-rounder Ben Cutting
  took the most punishment as his line and length deserted him. Pakistan were cruising
  at 40 for no loss until Zaman played one shot too many and was trapped leg before
  by Badree in the 5th over. Then came the first encounter s man of the match, Babar
  Azam. However, this time the World XI had clearly refined their bowling strategy.
  Both Ahmed Shehzad and Babar Azam struggled to get the boundary shots as the World
  XI bowling attack made brisk scoring difficult. In an innings that identically followed
  the script of the previous encounter, both Azam and Shehzad were dismissed in quick
  succession with Shoaib Malik and Imad Wasim once again providing the late impetus.  Malik
  in particular was in stupendous form, smacking three sixes in a quickfire innings
  of 39 runs off just 23 deliveries. Pakistan concluded the innings at 174 for 6,
  a stiff target once again for the World XI but not formidable by any means. Malik
  also became Pakistan s most prolific runscorer in T20 internationals. A brisk start
  to the run chase was crucial for the World XI if they were to chase the target set
  by Pakistan, and that was exactly what Tamim Iqbal and Hashim Amla delivered. Tamim
  looked set for a big innings but was unlucky to be dismissed for 23 by Shoaib Malik
  s magnificent diving catch. Hashim Amla at the other end though, was in a league
  of his own. The former South African Test captain put on a batting masterclass against
  the Pakistani pace and spin bowling alike, peppering the boundary boards at will
  as he raced to an effortless 50 off just 37 deliveries. Tim Paine and Faf du Plessis
  offered brief support but with 69 needed off the last 6 overs, it would need something
  special for the World XI to triumph. Nerves had begun to fray on both sides, with
  Pakistan captain Sarfraz looking extremely agitated with the poor fielding and wayward
  bowling from his charges. Enter burly Sri Lankan all-rounder Thisara Perera, a man
  accustomed to producing his best against Pakistan. It was an assault for the ages,
  as bit by bit the Pakistani pace bowlers caved under pressure and were obliterated
  by Perera. With 33 required off the last two overs it was Sohail Khan who blinked
  first as he was smashed out of the park for two humongous sixes by Perera. Rumman
  Raees stepped up to bowl the final over with 13 runs standing between the World
  XI and victory, which Perera duly sealed with a straight six off the second last
  ball of the game. A whirlwind knock of 47 runs off just 19 deliveries from the Sri
  Lankan all-rounder, with five towering sixes added for good measure. The partisan
  crowd was left awestruck by this demolition job by the World XI, and by the end
  was enthusiastic in their support for both teams. A loss for the home side it may
  be, but Pakistan cricket was most certainly the winner in a memorable evening in
  Lahore. But the best is yet to come and we will have to wait till Friday for it. '

language: en
publisher: Geo News
summary: null

text: 'LONDON: Leading Pakistani dentist Dr Ashiq Ghauri has said that Britain is
  gripped by a dental crisis and successive governments have failed to deal with the
  problem.  In an interview, the veteran British-Pakistani doctor, who has been practising
  for nearly 40 years now in London, said that the crisis is so huge that for around
  1100 patients there is only one doctor available to treat them. He said that Britain
  didn t face a situation like this ever before. Dr Ghauri, who trained in Pakistan
  before coming to the UK, is amongst the senior most British-Pakistani dentists in
  Britain, and known nationally for his expertise. He regularly addresses professional
  events on issues faced by the National Health Service (NHS) and its effects on the
  patients seeking care from the dentists. He said that there is shortage of dentist
  across Europe but Britain was worst affected and  the government has no solution
  and no vision to deal with this crisis.  The government thinks it can deal with
  the problem through cuts in budget, cuts in number of skilled professionals and
  cuts in the staff and that s creating more problems rather than resolving anything.
  Dental patients with dental pain are overdosing on painkillers because they are
  unable to access professional treatment as there is waiting time of months and it
  seems no one cares,  Dr Ghauri said. He said the problem is linked with the government
  s obsession with immigration.  Overseas doctors are not coming anymore to the UK,
  the number has reduced sharply because the government has brought in harsh immigration
  rules for skilled migrants and professional entry tests have been made almost impossible
  to pass. So many strict exam rules have been introduced not to improve standards
  but to make sure that the fresh intake is stopped,  Dr Ghauri explained. He said
  that those who manage to pass exams were unable to find workplace because of the
  problems created by the government.  Many of these doctors have left for Middle
  Eastern countries where pay scale is good and dentists are in demand. Lives are
  at risk in the UK but the government has no interest in dealing with these problems.
  Its obsession is with the numbers of immigration. It has failed to invest in both
  routine and emergency dental care, which is jeopardising appropriate diagnosis and
  treatment. This has heaped pressure across the NHS.  Dr Ghauri said that newly qualified
  and young dentists are leaving the NHS and going abroad or switching professions,
  which is alarming. He said the fact that millions of Britons were unable to access
  their local NHS dentist, because they were not accepting new patients, should worry
  the government and the NHS managers, but that didn t seem to be government s priority.
  Dr Ghauri said that currently there were around 1100 British-Pakistani dentists,
  who were serving patients but new Pakistani dentists were not coming over due to
  immigration rules.  Ethnic minorities formed nearly 40 percent of the NHS at one
  stage. Most of the staff were Indians, Afro-Carribeans, Pakistanis and others but
  now dentists from Europe are being brought in. The focus on European dentists has
  worsened the situation.  '

text: "Karzai and the lost war\n                            A lot has been said and\
  \ written in the media in Pakistan about the recent visit of President Karzai to\
  \ Islamabad. Efforts were made to pin responsibility for its failure on to him for\
  \ the simple reason that Islamabad declined to agree to nudge the Taliban to talk\
  \ to his government or release Taliban prisoners, including Mullah Adbul Ghani Barader.\
  \ This is not a fair and reasonable assessment. The visit was not Karzai's own initiative,\
  \ rather he was invited by the prime minister of Pakistan who had dangled vague\
  \ promises of a solution to the impasse. Therefore, shifting the burden of responsibility\
  \ from Nawaz Sharif to Karzai is completely unfair.Under the circumstances that\
  \ beset Afghanistan now \u2013 and also our border areas \u2013 such an invitation\
  \ for talks is taken as an indication of a serious initiative with something positive\
  \ in store for serious and meaningful discussions. If that was not the case then\
  \ why did Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif invite President Karzai to Islamabad to begin\
  \ with? Let us be fair and call a spade a spade. The key to the success or failure\
  \ of the visit was with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and not President Karzai. However,\
  \ if the visit was meant only to be used as yet another gimmick, after the election\
  \ campaign for changing our Afghan policy, that is an altogether different matter.The\
  \ war in Afghanistan has just started to come to an end and the US forces are headed\
  \ home via Torkham without having secured an agreed political dispensation for Afghanistan\
  \ after 2014. Efforts made so far in this regard have yielded no positive results.\
  \ And the widely publicised Doha process crash-landed even before taking off.While\
  \ the US tried its level best to get President Karzai to sign the strategic agreement\
  \ so that it could leave residuary power behind for security and other reasons,\
  \ the Afghan president seems to be reluctant to oblige. He is reported to have said\
  \ that he was not in a hurry to conclude the agreement and would be happy if someone\
  \ else signed it even after April 2014. Karzai has been termed by the western media\
  \ as the most difficult person amongst the allies to deal with. This waning of trust\
  \ between him and the west has given rise to speculation that the strategic agreement\
  \ may never be signed. And without that the US will not leave residuary power behind\
  \ and may be forced to opt for the \u2018zero option\u2019 \u2013 ie pulling all\
  \ its forces out of Afghanistan.President Karzai\u2019s interests converged with\
  \ those of the US till this point and he used that cleverly to further his personal\
  \ agenda. Carrying forward the US agenda when its forces are leaving Afghanistan\
  \ does not fall in line with his own interest of carving a place for himself in\
  \ his country's history as a nationalist leader. It is generally believed that after\
  \ stepping down (if he does so) he will stay in the country as an ordinary citizen.\
  \ In that case it is very unlikely that he will do anything that hurts the feelings\
  \ of his fellow Afghans or offend Afghan nationalism. He would prefer doing something\
  \ that portrays him as a nationalist leader and that opportunity has presented itself\
  \ in the shape of refusal to sign the strategic agreement.Another important factor\
  \ that should be kept in mind while dealing with the situation in Afghanistan is\
  \ the coming to an end of Karzai\u2019s second term as president. The million dollar\
  \ question is whether he will relinquish the presidency in April 2014 or hang on\
  \ to the position like the late Prof Burhanuddin Rabbani who resisted all calls\
  \ for stepping down and carried the position with him to Dushanbe when he was driven\
  \ out of Afghanistan by the Taliban in the late 1990s. Prof Rabbani claimed he did\
  \ that in the best interest of his people and President Karzai may also opt to do\
  \ the same in the \u2018best interests\u2019 of his people. A lot depends on the\
  \ situation\tprevailing at that time.The Taliban, on the other hand, have proved\
  \ their mettle by fighting successfully for 13 long years against the sole superpower\
  \ of the world. Their resilience and will to fight till victory have established\
  \ that they are a power to be reckoned with. They have proved that without their\
  \ participation peace in Afghanistan will remain an illusion and the people of Afghanistan\
  \ \u2013 as well as its neighbours \u2013 will continue to suffer.It is thus in\
  \ the best interest of all for us to join hands and find a way to bring the two\
  \ warring factions (Taliban and the Karzai government) together to the negotiating\
  \ table for a lasting solution. Only they can make Afghanistan safe by agreeing\
  \ to a future dispensation to run the country post-2014. In case of disagreement\
  \ the worst will follow where no one including their neighbours will feel safe and\
  \ secure.No one knows what Karzai will do to survive in the worst case scenario\
  \ once foreign forces leave the country. Many believe he will not survive even a\
  \ day. But will he be alone to face the situation like some leaders in Afghanistan's\
  \ bloody past or will some friends come around to help?Let us not underestimate\
  \ his abilities; he is a shrewd politician having already signed strategic agreements\
  \ with India and Iran, the two countries that staunchly supported the Northern Alliance\
  \ in its earlier fight against the Taliban. In a similar situation they will actively\
  \ support the government in Kabul and the two agreements wherein they have to provide\
  \ help and assistance to the defence forces of Afghanistan. The Russians and the\
  \ Central Asian Republics will follow suit in covert operations. The UN will continue\
  \ maintaining to recognise Karzai\u2019s government like it did when Prof Rabbani\
  \ was ousted from Kabul by the Taliban. In other words, the situation in Afghanistan\
  \ will go back to square one \u2013 only with the players in changed positions.Will\
  \ Pakistan prefer to stay in the same position it was in when it stood by the side\
  \ of the Taliban? If yes it will be as lonely as it was then. If not it will amount\
  \ to annoying the Taliban or in other words asking for trouble. In both cases the\
  \ options are not pleasant for Pakistan. The best choice would be to work seriously\
  \ on a plan whereby the Taliban and the Afghan government agree on a future government\
  \ in which both antagonists participate. A government by one leaving the other out\
  \ is neither likely to be acceptable to all Afghans nor practicable as the side\
  \ left out will not allow peace to return to the country.By playing an active part\
  \ in of the process of forming a government of the two (Taliban and the Afghan government)\
  \ Pakistan will have a friendly Afghanistan which will serve its interests far better\
  \ than just a friendly government in Kabul alone.\tPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif has\
  \ not yet played the role he had promised before and after elections to take steps\
  \ to put our Afghan policy on the right track in accordance with public expectations.On\
  \ the contrary by asking for consensus of political parties first he appears to\
  \ be reluctant to take a clear-cut decision on this issue. One fails to understand\
  \ why he is going through the motions of this exercise when through the heavy vote\
  \ of the electorate he has already been given a go-ahead by the public to tackle\
  \ militancy.The writer is a former ambassador. Email: [email\_protected]"

  \ The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday observed that no matter if Jahangir Tareen's\
  \ sugar mills are sold out as it declined to reopening the sugar mills owned by\
  \ the Sharif family in south Punjab and ordered five sugar mills in the area to\
  \ devise a complete plan for purchasing sugarcane from the farmers by Tuesday.A\
  \ three-member bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar,\
  \ resumed hearing in an appeal filed by the sugar farmers\u2019 body \u2014 CPLA\
  \ \u2014 against the Lahore High Court\u2019s verdict declaring the relocation of\
  \ Sharif family\u2019s three sugar mills in southern Punjab illegal.The court directed\
  \ representatives of the five sugar mills to formulate a strategy for lifting the\
  \ sugarcane from the growers and submit report before it. During the course of hearing\
  \ counsel representing the growers informed the court that the sugarcane was left\
  \ in the field of around 29,4000 acres of land while sugarcane of Rs17 billion was\
  \ available in Rahimyar Khan district. The chief justice, however, observed that\
  \ as other sugar mills were not operating in the area, who asked the farmers to\
  \ grow more sugarcane. The chief justice observed that the Lahore High Court had\
  \ declared illegal Ittefaq Chaudhry and Haseeb Waqas sugar mills. He said that there\
  \ was no justification of re-opening of non-operational mills.Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan,\
  \ counsel for Jehangir Tareen, however, again assured the court of purchasing the\
  \ sugarcane from the growers. On last hearing, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader\
  \ and Jamaludin Wali (JDW) Sugar Mills owner Jehangir Tareen, along with four sugar\
  \ mills owners, expressed his willingness to purchase the harvested sugarcane from\
  \ all the farmers affected by the closure of the Sharif family sugar mills.Barrister\
  \ Aitzaz Ahsan had given an undertaking before the court that his client along with\
  \ the owners of Hamza, Ashraf, RYK and Indus sugar mills was ready to buy the harvested\
  \ sugarcane from the growers at the rate fixed by the government.On Monday, in order\
  \ to resolve the matter, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar asked for constituting a\
  \ three-member committee comprising additional judge, representatives from sugar\
  \ mills as well as representatives of farmers giving complete plan by Tuesday for\
  \ purchasing sugarcane.The cane commissioner told the court that around 57 spots\
  \ had been established for purchasing the sugarcane. While the growers complained\
  \ to the court that severe injustice was being done to them.The chief justice asked\
  \ the counsel for the growers as to whether the farmers were brought in for exerting\

  \ and farmers should submit their respective proposals and the court after examining\
  \ them will pass an appropriate order.The court assured that the farmers would get\
  \ the rate, fixed by the government for purchasing the sugarcane and adjourned further\
  \ hearing till February 21. The Pakistan Kissan Ittehad had filed a civil petition\
  \ for Leave to Appeal (CPLA) through the Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Muhammad\
