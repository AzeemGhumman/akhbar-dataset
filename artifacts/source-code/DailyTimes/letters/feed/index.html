The POPC turned out to be very helpful to me, slightly over a year ago. I had left Lahore to live in the UK, and had rented [&#8230;]</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Sir: If pre-election pledges were not to become post-elections shocks, national priorities need to be pursued by the new Government in letter and spirit. What repose public trust and confidence-building is when leaders deliver what they promise to the nation amid election fever and campaigning with commitments. Though NAB’s endeavour to inculcate character building at [&#8230;]</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Sir: Eid Mubarak — or at least I thought so, until I heard that 6 innocent Ahmadi Muslims were shot and persecuted for their beliefs. On July 25, 2018, the people of Pakistan elected star-cricketer Imran Khan from the PTI party to be the country’s Prime Minister. Throughout his campaign Imran Khan had boasted about [&#8230;]</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Sir, I want to draw your attention towards the biasness prevalent against the females in our society.

People are excited to meet their families and enjoy a nice meal with them, while others are perhaps more interested in the holiday itself, and spend the day sleeping in.
