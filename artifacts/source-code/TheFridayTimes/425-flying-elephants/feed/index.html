		<description><![CDATA[Good article. The title reminds me of Garcia Marquez&#039;s explanation of his own literary genre that is called Magic Realism.He said, &quot;If you tell people elephants are flying,nobody will believe you but if you say 425 elephants are flying,some may believe it. It is been beautifully summed up at the beginning by the writer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If only PTI was not a part of political scene all problems would have disappeared. If only the so called champions of democracy ever had the courage to ask the same questions from PPP, PMLn, JUI, MQM or ANP. If only the writer ever though of any wrong in other politicians..... Jeay Nawaz! Jeay Zardari! No?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Its essentially abuse of power. He is no different from most of us. Imran (bhai) can get away with it because he can (remember Clinton&#039;s excuse?). He knows he has blind support from his followers who will not question him and do dharnas at his whims. The leader and the followers are eerily similar to Altaf bhai and his followers.  Politicians, mullahs, judiciary, military abuse their powers too. We know now terms of Wukla Gardi and Police Gardi. The corruption by the patwari, policeman, clerk or any civil servant is also an abuse of power. Why did the people vote for Mr. 10% and why do they tolerate the white lies of IK? They condone it and they will do the same if they had a chance. We are the product of this society and no matter what power or authority we are entrusted with, we shall abuse it. We can keep on criticizing the individuals and institutions but nothing will change till the society start producing decent and honest citizens for they are the material with which nations are made.]]></description>
