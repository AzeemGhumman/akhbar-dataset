		<description><![CDATA[Excellent detailed analyses. The writer has done really a good job in analyzing all the issues and presenting facts to even a layman like me. Now, can he do the same for Pakistan? Shockingly, no one alleged a single cheating or rigging in this election, or perhaps I did not read it. We have the same Choudharies, sons, daughters, incompetent husbands -first cousins, and pirs, all relecting machines, thieves, tax evaders, moustachioed beer bellied, heavy set dueds who have no education, or just have the basic education, never read or worte a book, no intellectual honesty, who has been robbing us for a very long time and do not desist from their prennial criminal activities. Modi may be accused of many things but one credit goes to him ------he is patriotic to the core and second, he does not have corruption on his hands. Two characteristics which Pakistani politicians have undiluted dirt on their hands. I should agree with Imran Khan here that if there is a rule of law in Pakistan about 90 percent of these legislators should have been languishing behind bars.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very good detailed &#038; comprehensive explanation of India Election 2014 &#038; its outcome. It also predictably reflects the coming effects on Indian Society. No Doubt    ,BJP led NDA government is much much needed &#038; hopefully &#039;Acche Din Aane Wale Hain&#039;... And also the speculation regarding the Muslim representation in Lower House would be proven  wrong. The Government welfare process will touch all sections of society &#038; will definitely benefit minorities &#038; weaker sections. However this article is a great piece &#038; applicable to be archived for a wonderful description of   this 2014 ELECTION. Waiting for next column. Thanks.]]></description>
