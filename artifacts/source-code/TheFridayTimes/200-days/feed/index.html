		<description><![CDATA[As I come to realize that General Sales Tax and Value Added Tax impose more burden on poor than rich because these taxes are levy on products and services. Why don&#039;t use &quot;flat consumption tax&quot; (income - saving = consumption)? This will lead to three things: 1) if I consume more, I will end up paying more taxes (less burden on lower income people), 2) it will be in my interest to show more income and savings in order to offset taxes (win win for economy) and 3) a flat 10% to 15% rate will encourage me to pay taxes than spend money to hide my wealth. ALSO, THE FUNNY THING IS THAT YOU WON&#039;T SEE THOSE POLITICIANS UNDERSTATING THEIR INCOMES. By the way the tax to GDP ratio in my opinion translate into bigger government. There are lots of evidence to support that big government is not a good solution. 

I don&#039;t think prime minister energy policy is viable. He should have let private sector to take care of energy crisis. Competition will not only increase units of electricity on national grid but also lower the per unit price, just like in mobile phone industry.  

Where prime minister should be focusing the most is law &#038; order, judicial reform, tax reform, decentralization of government, reducing the size of government and foreign affairs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After  a  long  time  the  editorial    projects  a  positive  progressive  picture  of  Pakistan.  happy  about  it. The  reason  for  not  tapping  internal  resources  like  tax  collection  could  be  that  America  was  generous  enough  to  supply  dollars  right  since  1950.  perhaps  it  is  easier  that  way.  Such  sustained  dependence  could  have  sapped  National  pride,  and  drained  motivation  for  self  growth

  with  frequent  disturbance  in  administration,
Tax  source  tapping  is  compromised.   But  this  can  be  rectified  soon .  The  Govt   should,  preach,  teach,  reach  all  rich  and  middle  class  constantly.  I  do  not  know  what  is  Islamic  punishment  for  tax  evasion .

If  PM  Nawaz  and  his  rich  relatives,  if  all  ministers  and  their relatives,  and  if  all   industrialists  and  their  relatives,  if  all  generals  and  their  relatives,  and  if  all  administrators  and  their  relatives  come  forward  to  pay  tax  in  full, dependance  will  reduce.

Austerities,  and   good  relationship  with  IRAN,  INDIA  and  Afganistan  will  result  in  savings.

The  future  is  bright.  happy  new  year  to  all.]]></description>
