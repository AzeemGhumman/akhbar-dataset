		<description><![CDATA[Your reply shows lack of true understanding of aggressive climate that Muslims in contemporary West are going through. Not everywhere, one has to flaunt liberal thought without first going into detailed studies of as to what&#039;s going on around. 

Mr. S. Akbar does not live in Muslim majority country, but in a non-Muslim state, where he and the likes him go through &#039;Islamophobia&#039;. And thus it becomes his duty to educate those who carry bigotry and prejudice for Muslims.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[However,even after appreciating the well written article and even agreeing to the inherent qualities of early Islam, there are NO 10 things that will surprise us about conditions of minorities in Islamic states today. The last Christians are emptying out of Iraq and Syria.
I hope for the better anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sir, each community and civilizations of the world at large can come up with such list of historical achievements. Unfortunately, there are also several historical dastardly and inhuman acts associated with them. Wherever Muslims conquered and ruled the minorities, these evil acts overtook any good ones. Besides, while history may be a good mirror to guide our present day acts, the Muslim actions currently in Europe, as well as Muslim dominated areas, are less than praiseworthy, to put it mildly. What we need is to drive ourselves to the present-day solutions to motivate and modernize our thinking, rather than dwell on the past achievements.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Professor Akbar S. Ahmad have witten a powerful presentation in the dust of Islamofobia. 
Unfortunately the hawks of west do not like a positive word or truth about Islam or Muslims. This tendency will never serve humanity but will help the western war industry.
Nobody from the western world is ready to answer about the blood of innocent muslim women, children and oldmen , killed in millions by west in the neme of &quot; war against terrorism&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Iftikhar hasn&#039;t understood the true message of Mr. Akbar.
Islam, which is so much maligned in USA and Europe these days, is not flawed. If Muslims established  advanced civilization in Al Andalus and Baghdad as followers of their faith, they can do so again by applying the values and principles of Islam. Current predicament of Muslims around the world is nothing more than a turn of cycle of history which every civilization- from Egyptians to Babylonians to Romans and British have experienced. Many observers think USA is in decline and will become obvious in 10-15 years. No civilization has avoided ups and downs. Right wingers in USA and Europe don&#039;t have clue about history,their perspective is shaped by what they see on their TV and hear from the likes of Geert Wilder in Netherland, Marine le Pen in France, Pam Geeler in USA to name a few rather than any historical framework of analysis. In any field of endeavor no one
can stay at the top for too long. It is tough to get to the top and tougher to stay their.Decline is inevitable. Hopefully, Muslims can begin to question their religious views which are more attuned to the rituals and even infused by
superstition and concentrate more on understanding the
true meaning of Islam, its values and principles. This
process of reconstruction that Allama Iqbal advocated will
start at some point when few men of courage and wisdom
will take the lead.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These ten things are as irrelevant to the socio-political discourse at present in Europe as plato, Aristotle, Demicritis, Socrates and host of other Greek philosophers to the on-going melt down of Greek economy. What is the point my dear Akbar S Ahmed you are trying to convey -  with some fancy pictures - to the readers unless you consider readers dying to read only good things about Spanish-European experience with Islam. What is worth mentioning except Averroes (Ibn-Rushd) in this context? What was good in Muslim-ruled Andalusia despite being a minority is presented as Muslim egalitarianism while conveniently ignoring Muslim rule in Muslim majority areas of Asia and Africa. The Muslim scholars of current age are speaking from both side of the tongue; one for Muslims living in Muslim majority areas and one for Muslims living in Muslim minority areas (or countries). With their backs against the wall in the west and countries like India, the Islamic message is peace, brotherhood, harmony, equality, justice and other common sense stuff while in Muslim majority countries       it is about following Quran and Hadith, segregation of women from men, following rituals regularly and standing up to kafirs etc. What a Sufi could say abot islamic message, living among a sea of Hindus, somewhere in India is markedly different than a Muslim mullah or scholar is saying to mostly Muslims in Lahore, Karachi, Wana or Khost.

On a different note, is there a Newton chair, a Galileo chair, a Freud chair, a Shakespeare chair or a Toynbee chair in any university in the Muslim countries? It sure feels good for Muslims to be recognized and respected in the form of Ibn Khaldun chair in the American University in Washington, D.C - the capital of most  poweful Christian majority country.]]></description>
