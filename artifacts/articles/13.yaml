text: "Shah Rukh Khan speaks out against gender wage disparity in Bollywood \n\nThe\
  \ issue of gender wage disparity that has stood firm against time in Bollywood has\
  \ had numerous stars voice their concerns over it, and now Shah Rukh Khan has joined\
  \ the fight to close the gap.The Bollywood King, in an interview with Economic Times,\
  \ went into discourse about the grave issue saying both men and women deserve an\
  \ equal pay in the Indian film industry. \"It\u2019s a male-dominated industry.\
  \ You can\u2019t shirk it away or ignore it. I would love it to be different. There\
  \ should be no disparity. A male actor and a female actor should get the same fees\
  \ \u2014 why is it different, I don\u2019t know. But I would also add that no actor\
  \ \u2014 male or female \u2014 should over-estimate their performance,\u201D stated\
  \ the megastar.The Raees actor went on to comment: \u201CNo individual \u2014 be\
  \ it director or actor \u2014 should burden the film\u2019s expense by charging\
  \ an amount that goes beyond the performance of the film\u2019s opening weekend.\u201D"
