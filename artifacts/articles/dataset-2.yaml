heading: Investors to get their say after Musk scuttles Tesla buyout
language: en

text: 'Investors on Monday will render their verdict on Tesla Chief Executive Elon
  Musk s decision to abandon a proposed $72 billion buyout to take the luxury electric
  car maker private.  Musk said in a blog post late on Friday that his decision to
  scuttle the proposed deal was motivated in part by existing Tesla shareholders who
  said they wanted the company to remain publicly-traded. The trading on Monday will
  be a test of how investors are taking the demise of the buyout plan, and their views
  on whether Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, can avoid going back to capital
  markets to raise more cash. Tesla s shares already had fallen nearly 10 percent
  below their level on Aug. 7, just before Musk tweeted that he had  funding secured  for
  a buyout at $420 a share. Investors in Tesla s bonds and convertible debt also had
  shown skepticism that the buyout would materialize during the days after that tweet,
  and a subsequent blog post in which Musk made a case for going private. With Musk
  s idea of a buyout backed by Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund off the table,
  investors will focus on Tesla s efforts to become profitable, the company s cash
  reserves and what steps Musk could take to raise fresh capital. Musk and Tesla also
  face a series of investor lawsuits and a US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation
  into the factual accuracy of Musk s tweet that funding for the buyout deal was  secured.  Tesla
  had $2.78 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, after a record $718
  million loss. In early August, before the buyout plan was made public, Tesla reiterated
  a forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, under
  normal accounting rules, and Musk said the company would not need to raise more
  cash. A Tesla spokesman on Sunday referred to those previous comments. One of Tesla
  s biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3,
  which is critical to its profitability goals. Tapping capital markets Analysts have
  suggested a capital raise may be required soon to boost investor confidence. Musk
  and Tesla could hold off on any fundraising plans for the time being, in part tapping
  capital markets would contradict Musk s comments about Tesla being adequately funded,
  investment bankers who are not working for the company said over the weekend. This
  week would also be an inopportune time for a capital raising, given that many bankers
  and investors are away ahead of the Sept. 3 Labour Day holiday.  The high price
  investors have put on Tesla s shares has allowed Musk to expand US production, invest
  in building out a vehicle charging network and start work on new models including
  a small sport utility vehicle, a new Roadster and a semi-truck even as the company
  burned cash. Tesla earlier this year announced plans to build a battery and vehicle
  assembly complex in China. Musk said earlier this month the company s  default plan  would
  be to fund that expansion by borrowing money from Chinese banks. '

  Mustehsan, seems to be all in favour of women empowerment. The Coke Studio singer
  is of the opinion that there should be a separate PSL held for female cricketers.
  The Islamabad United ambassador was speaking to Geo.TV, where she was asked if there
  should be a PSL for women cricketers to go along with the theme of women empowerment.
  Momina said that it s an important theme that should be highlighted. Giving an example
  of her team s fellow female ambassadors, who happen to be female cricketers too,
  the singer said that the sport should be promoted at the same level for both genders.
  Girls should also excel in this field, she said. When asked that if other teams
  should also take a leaf out of Islamabad United s book as far as the addition of
  female cricket ambassadors goes, Momina said that not only franchises, the entire
  nation should be promoting this initiative.  We need to set a precedent so we get
  more Bismas and Javerias,  she said while referring to fellow team ambassadors and
  female cricketers. Equality should be for everyone and everywhere, said the Coke
  Studio singer. When the subject turned to the national anthem of Islamabad United  Cricket
  Joray Pakistan  Mustehsan was asked about the concept behind the song. The song
  is about bringing the nation together as a lot of Pakistanis are here to watch the
  sport, no matter what team they support, cricket unifies them in the end, she commented.  Cricket
  always does bring us together,  she added. At the end of the interview, when asked
  to chant a few lines from the song she sang for her team, Momina politely declined.   '

  \ on Azhar\u2019s otherwise celebrated career.Ironically, it was Azhar\u2019s slower\

  \ high and handsome to foster some of the craziest celebrations in Irish Cricket\
  \ history.No wonder, this is one game Azhar never feels comfortable discussing.Meanwhile,\
  \ Mohammad Yousuf is quick to point out the grudge ICC had towards Pakistan as they\
  \ did their part in assisting Ireland, \u201CGreen top wicket was deliberately prepared\
  \ for our match\u201D.He was also cynical about the media trial that followed, \u201C\
  We can\u2019t forget how media bashed us after that match, India lost to Bangladesh\
  \ in the same World Cup but their media didn't give them the same treatment\u201D\
  .Background2007 was probably the darkest year in Pakistan cricket. To start off\
  \ with, they never had the ideal preparations walking into the Mega Event. A 3-1\
  \ drubbing against the Protease on their home ground did little to boost their confidence.\
  \ That defeat was followed by another scratchy performance against the West-Indies\
  \ in the tournament opener where Lara\u2019s men handed them a 54 run defeat.On\
  \ the other side, a splendid century by Jeremy Bray helped Ireland fight out a thrilling\
  \ tie against the much experienced Zimbabweans. Don\u2019t forget, this was their\
  \ first ever World Cup.From there on, the stage was set for the Irish to step up\
  \ and lock arms with the big boys. Their next obstruction was the Sub-continent\
  \ giants, Pakistan. With a reputation of always being ready for self destruction,\
  \ they were just the kind of opponents the Irish needed to engineer the greatest\
  \ upset in modern cricket. Iceberg, right ahead!!!This was not going to be Pakistan\u2019\
  s day, and that was evident with the first proceeding of the day when Johnston called\
  \ correctly at the toss and sent Pakistan to bat on a grass top wicket.It was also\
  \ the Irish National holiday known as St. Patrick's Day and somehow the grass on\
  \ the pitch matched the Irish shade of green, perhaps setting the right ingredients\
  \ for a National Feast later in the day.Years later, Irish Off spinner Kyle McCallan\
  \ admitted he was shocked to see the green top wicket,\u201CThe pitch was absolutely\
  \ green and that played into our hands as Irish players are used to such pitches\
  \ whereas there are not many such wickets in Pakistan, so when Johnston won the\
  \ Toss we could see an opportunity to exploit\u201D. The Pakistani camp knew it\
  \ was not going to be an easy outing either. Their coach; the Late Bob Woolmer described\
  \ the game as a \u201CSerious banana skin fixture\u201D.The Irish had done their\
  \ homework; it took Langford- Smith just six balls to find flaws in Hafiz\u2019\
  s technique when he made him edge an away swinger to the keeper.That top order jolt\
  \ was too much for the incoming batsmen and they kept leaving the field in haste,\
  \ as if hot chicken biryani was being served in the dressing room.Such was the accuracy\
  \ in the Irish bowling and juice in the wicket that seven Pakistani batsmen failed\
  \ to reach double figures. Imran Nazir did little to stabilise things with 24 while\
  \ Kamran Akmal resisted with a hard fought 27 to stretch the score to a miserable\
  \ 132.That done, Ireland had done half the job, but their smiles were cautious as\
  \ they knew a treacherous ride awaited them ahead.Captain Inspirational 132 was\

  have been stranded due to administration negligence. All of these students come
  from distant cities and areas in the province, while some hail from outside Punjab.
  Geo News has learnt that police had given a notice to hostel administration a week
  ago. They said that they had repeatedly asked the administration to improve security,
  before finally getting the hostels vacated tonight upon non-compliance of orders
  by admin staff. Reached for comment, hostel administration declined the request.
  Police said the hostels will not be reopened until adequate security arrangements
  are made. The situation also perplexed the parents of the students, who questioned
  where would their children go at this hour of night. The students, outside the hostels,
  were found calling their relatives and friends in Lahore in search of a temporary
  place to stay at. No institute asked to get hostels vacated: DIG On the other hand,
  DIG Operations Lahore Haider Ashraf denied that the police asked NCA administration
  to get the hostels vacated. "We have not asked administration of any educational
  institution to get its hostels vacated," Ashraf said, adding that police were providing

text: 'They were considered the most lethal and devastating fast bowling pair of the
  90 s, a pair that mastered and lifted the art of reverse swing to uncatchable heights.
  One broke feet with his much feared toe-crushers while the other terrorised batsmen
  with his swinging bouncers. They hunted best in pairs and destroyed lineups regardless
  of conditions and oppositions.Their love for the game and bonding together grew
  with every falling wicket, but somehow this happy union was hurt by someone s envious
  wish and the love affair went sour.Who can forget their all conquering smile pose
  during the 92 English tour where they cemented a clear domination over Graham Gooch
  s men. But the very next year sowed the foundation of the great divide amongst the
  two most lethal quickies of modern era.Jawed Miandad was stripped off captaincy
  after the failure of Down Under and Wasim was installed in his place. However, just
  after one series into captaincy against the West Indies, players complained off
  Wasim authoritative behavior and Waqar pulled off a mutiny that included some big
  names in the team. Akram had to resign and Salim Malik was installed as the compromise
  captain.From then onwards, the breach could never be healed and the Demon of Mistrust
  kept rising its ugly face time to time. Friendship amongst the two was all but buried
  and the desire for revenge brewed with every possible opportunity.           Big
  year   Big Fights1999 was the eventful year when differences between the two were
  elevated to the next level. They were hardly at talking terms during the short tour
  of India and poor Inzi had to run around playing the courier guy. But it was the
  World Cup in England where Wasim actually got to test Waqar s nerves.Despite all
  of Wasim s tactics, Waqar somehow did find a place in the touring squad but remained
  mostly on the bench. The fire spitting Shoaib Akthar was at his fiercely best and
  that gave Wasim a good reason to curb his role to a water boy. Waqar only featured
  in the fateful game against Bangladesh while Wasim s dream of walking high like
  Imran Khan were shattered by Kangaroos in the finals.The rivalry resurfaced again
  in the later part of the year when Pakistan faced Australians in their backyard.
  Waqar was made to sit out the first test and Pakistan were hammed with a 10 wicket
  defeat. Waqar by now had passed his boiling point and decided to speak out in the
  press against Wasim, arguing that Akram s long-term grudge was ruining his career
  and the best place to settle that bitterness was inside a room and not on the ground.This
  outburst resulted in Waqar putting on his spikes in the Hobart test. His impact
  was felt immediately when he trapped Mark Waugh, next to follow was his trademark
  in-swinger that removed Rickey Ponting for a duck. The jubilation in Waqar s follow-through
  was a clear reminder for Wasim that he could keep Waqar out of cricket, but certainly
  not cricket out of Waqar. Sadly Waqar faced an ankle injury and sat out the last
  test.Wasim lost the captaincy after the 3-0 drubbing and Waqar got the armband during
  the 2001 England tour. Around this time the whistle blowing Justice Qayyum report
  came out highlighting the Evil of Match Fixing and greed in Pakistan cricket. Apart
  from other suggestions, one was never to let Wasim captain his country again. Wasim
  kept playing under Waqar s captaincy for the next year and a half, but these once
  good friends kept their fiercest revelries saved for the World Cup, neither having
  a heart big enough to let the other capture a permanent place in the countries folklore.2003
  World Cup, tempering the Bad-BloodWasim had a rocking World Cup where he bagged
  3 against Australia in the opening match, and then took 3 against Netherlands to
  reach the magical 500 haul. He couldn t kill any Indian batsmen in the all important
  Centurion game and this was perhaps convinced Waqar of deliberate underperformance.In
  the next game against Zimbabwe, rain sealed Pakistan s early exit from the tournament.
  While the nation was in shock, TV screens showed a relaxed and somewhat content
  looking Wasim standing outside the dressing room and warmly greeting the Zimbabwean
  players, this only added more wood to the already blazing fire.The bitter rivalry
  had cracked yet another cup and the curtain fell simultaneously on the careers of
  two most illustrious fast bowlers of modern times.In April 2004, while India was
  touring Pakistan, Waqar announced his retirement. During a packed News conference
  in an Islamabad hotel, Waqar minced no words in disclosing that he mistrusted a
  Few Friends during the 2003 Cup. His book would reveal the true story and characters.
  Both have maintained that age and maturity has over taken the bitter taste and good
  sense prevails, sadly that s only true till and before the World Cup.For the mega
  event the expectations from Pakistani bowlers were always high, but Waqar s boys
  have so far failed to impact mattering opponents. Wasim is in Australia and has
  repeatedly shown his willingness to shoulder the falling apart bowling line and
  put the spark in their plugs, but perhaps his help is as un-welcoming as his presence
  in the Pakistani dressing room. While Waqar was made to keep towers dry and bottles
  filled during the 99 Cup, he must have kept repeating to himself the basic coaching
  tip,  Wait for the bad ball . It s his time now and he is solely calling the shots
  like the powerful before him did. By keeping Wasim out, his shattered Ego would
  definitely see satisfaction, but it might come at the cost of another broken Cup.                                   '

publisher: Geo News
summary: null

text: 'THE HAGUE: Iran will argue Monday against renewed sanctions imposed by the
  United States, as a bitter legal battle between Tehran and Washington opens before
  the UN s top court. US President Donald Trump reimposed a wave of tough unilateral
  sanctions on Iran three weeks ago, bringing back into effect harsh penalties that
  had been lifted under a landmark 2015 agreement. A second round of measures is to
  come into effect in early November, targeting Iran s valuable oil and energy sector.
  Tehran filed its case before the International Court of Justice in late July, calling
  on the Hague-based tribunal s judges to order the immediate lifting of sanctions,
  which it said would cause "irreparable prejudice." The US had no right to reinstate
  such measures, Tehran added, as it demanded compensation for damages. Iran maintained
  restoring the penalties lifted under the historic 2015 deal, aimed at curbing Tehran
  s nuclear ambitions, violated a decades-old treaty signed between the two nations
  in 1955. The ICJ -- set up in 1946 to rule in disputes between countries -- is expected
  to take a couple of months to decide whether to grant Tehran s request for a provisional
  ruling, while a final decision in the case may actually still take years. Trump
  described the 2015 deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the United
  Nations Security Council, as well as Germany, as a "horrible one-sided deal (that)
  failed to achieve the fundamental objective of blocking all paths to a Iranian nuclear
  bomb." Even though all of the other parties pleaded with him not to abandon the
  pact, Trump pulled out and announced he would reinstate sanctions.  Neither war,
  nor negotiations  Tehran -- which argues that the move violates the little-known
  1955 Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations -- says that the new sanctions are already
  hurting its economy. Iran s currency the rial has lost around half its value since
  April. A raft of international companies -- including France s Total, Peugeot and
  Renault, and Germany s Siemens and Daimler -- have suspended operations in Iran
  in the wake of the move. Both Air France and British Airways announced Thursday
  they were halt flights to Tehran next month, saying they were not commercially viable,
  but the British carrier added the decision was unrelated to the new tranche of sanctions.
  In his executive order, Trump argued that the sanctions would turn up the financial
  pressure on Tehran to come to a "comprehensive and lasting solution" regarding activities
  that the international community regarded as "malign" such as Iran s "ballistic
  missile programme and its support for terrorism." Earlier this month, Iran s supreme
  leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to rule out any immediate prospect of talks,
  saying "there will be neither war, nor negotiations," with the US. Washington s
  lawyers will present their case on Tuesday, with experts believing they are to challenge
  the ICJ s jurisdiction. '

text: 'United Nations investigators on Monday called for an international probe and
  prosecution of Myanmar''s army chief and five other top military commanders for
  genocide against the country''s Rohingya minority.  "Myanmar''s top military generals,
  including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated
  and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes
  against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States," a UN-backed
  fact-finding mission said. Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled northern Rakhine state
  to Bangladesh after Myanmar launched a brutal crackdown last August on insurgents
  amid accounts of arson, murder and rape at the hands of soldiers and vigilante mobs
  in the mainly Buddhist country. Myanmar has vehemently denied allegations of ethnic
  cleansing, insisting it was responding to attacks by Rohingya rebels.  But in Monday
  s report, the UN mission insisted the army tactics had been "consistently and grossly
  disproportionate to actual security threats." The mission, which was created by
  the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017, concluded in a report that "there is
  sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials
  in the Tatmadaw (Myanmar army) chain of command." "The crimes in Rakhine State,
  and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and
  scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,"
  the report said. The investigators named Min Aung Hlaing and five other top military
  commanders, adding that a longer list of names could be shared with "any competent
  and credible body pursuing accountability in line with international norms and standards."
  Criticism was also directed at Myanmar s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel
  Peace Prize laureate who has been the target of global vitriol for a perceived failure
  to stand up for the stateless minority. The report found that she had "not used
  her de facto position as head of government, nor her moral authority, to stem or
  prevent the unfolding events."  While acknowledging that she and other civilian
  authorities had little influence on military actions, it said that they "through
  their acts and omissions... have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes."
  The investigators called on the UN Security Council to refer the Myanmar situation
  to the International Criminal Court, or for an ad hoc international criminal tribunal
  to be created. They also recommended an arms embargo and "targeted individual sanctions
  against those who appear to be most responsible." '

  the child bearing years.The first ever Global Nutrition Report that tracks the progress
  of 193 member countries of the United Nations in improving their nutrition status
  also identified Pakistan beginning to encounter the problem of adult obesity and

  Health Assembly nutrition targets that include reducing child stunting and wasting
  anaemia in women of reproductive age and low birth weight preventing a worsening
  of child overweight and increasing exclusive breastfeeding of infants.With urban
  transition and changing lifestyles Pakistan is now facing a mixed pattern of malnutrition
  with high rates of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies among poor women

  along with his colleagues had examined the impact on stunting and wasting in Bangladesh
  Ethiopia and Pakistan of scaling up coverage of key nutrition specific programmes
  plus interventions related to optimising birth intervals and improving water sanitation
  and hygiene. The results showed that by scaling up key interventions the model estimates
  reductions in the prevalence of stunting of 17 per cent 21 percent and 18 percent
  from 2013 to 2025 in Bangladesh Ethiopia and Pakistan respectively. Predicted reductions
  in the prevalence of severe wasting were estimated at 65 percent 62 percent and
  58 percent respectively.The impacts on severe wasting are particularly noteworthy
  whereas the estimated declines in stunting are modest and signal the need to increase
  both the coverage and quality of these interventions.Prof Zulfiqar Bhutta also the
  founding director of the Centre for Excellence in Women and Child Health at Aga

  Rs300,000 to return her, while the police said they could not do anything to expedite

  in vain as police have been using delaying tactics. The woman''s husband reported
  receiving a phone call from a man in Afghanistan who asked him for Rs300,000 to

  #HBLPSL #AbKhelJamayGa #QGvIU DUBAI: Islamabad United skipper Misbahul Haq on Friday
  lauded veteran fast bowler Muhammad Sami`s performance by calling him a  proven
  match winner . Sami delivered one of his best spells in T20 cricket to defend 5
  runs off the last over, helping Islamabad defeat Quetta Gladiators by one run and
  confirming a berth in the Pakistan Super League playoffs. Speaking about the match-changing
  last over, Misbah said: "He''s a proven match winner and if there was someone we
  could turn to for the last over, it was Sami. With all of his experience, it turned
  out to be the right decision." He added: "We were under pressure for 18 overs, but
  that''s cricket. We held our nerves, stuck to a plan, and thanks to Allah it worked
  out." Sami - who is celebrating his 36th birthday today - in a facebook live session
  said that while bowling the final over he ensured that he sticks with the team plan.   Quetta
  needed just five runs off last over with six wickets in hands but Anwar Ali and
  Rilee Rossouw failed to complete the victory for Quetta. Chasing a target of 166
  in 20 overs, Quetta were provided a solid base by Ahmad Shahzad and Kevin Pietersen,
  but despite coming so near to the victory, Gladiators fell short. '

text: 'KARACHI: The Federal Government and provinces are neither serious about nor
  taking an interest in holding population and housing census in the country. It s
  a legal obligation imposed on the Federal Government in the Federal Legislative
  list of fourth schedule to the Constitution; nevertheless, hurdles are being created
  to delay or stop the sixth census in Pakistan, as mentioned in Aam log Ittehad Petition
  filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. According to Petitioner Justice (retd) Wajihuddin
  Ahmed, Acting Chairman Aam Loeg Ittehad:  While the first four censuses were more
  or less regularly and duly held in the years 1951, 1961, 1972 and 1981, the fifth
  census was undertaken in 1998 after 17 years, an inordinate delay of 7 years which
  was certainly avoidable. That is not to say that the pervious censuses were problem
  free.  However, we are now in the 21st century and living in the Information Age,
  with little or no scope for such aberrations.  Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed said in
  a separate statement:  None of the governments are serious in the matter, though
  for different reasons. The Federal Government is engaged in a mechanical exercise,
  solely because it has to honor its undertaking before the apex court. The sardars
  and Khans of Balochistan and KP feel threatened that once their impecunious and
  burgeoning populations are quantified, their own lavish and luxurious lifestyles
  would come under scrutiny. The Sindh government, which exclusively represents rural
  Sindh, is determined to inflate the numbers in rural areas and decimate those in
  urban Sindh.  Justice Wajih further said that the census is an activity necessary
  to assess the needs on the basis of population, and this act will be beneficial
  for human rights. The petition points out that the leadership of Punjab is no wiser.
  It is fully aware that the proportion of their population is slowly declining and
  if census is held it would no longer be officially reflected as being 55.63% of
  the population of Pakistan. The estimated Punjab population, as per the 2011 Housing
  Census, is 47.69%. In the previous census of 1998, while a slower per annum growth
  rate of 2.64% in Punjab was recorded, Sindh registered a growth rate of 2.80% per
  annum. The petition further states that if this trend continues, it is bound to
  have a negative impact on the 148 National Assembly seats allocated to the province
  of Punjab under the Constitution. In order to maintain and ensure the numerical
  majority of the province of Punjab in the population census of Pakistan, some functionaries
  of the Punjab government are keen to have the exercise of the forthcoming census
  abandoned. The notables of Punjab need to realise that if the present population
  ratio of their province is unrealistically maintained and reflected to be higher
  than it actually is, history may repeat itself. In similar circumstances, the former
  province of East Pakistan, having a 54% share of the total population, seceded,
  not the least for the reason that the former province of West Pakistan was not in
  favour of the idea of remaining a permanent minority province, says the petition.
  The petition notes that the situation is particularly sensitive in Sindh because
  at this eleventh hour the government is proactively pursuing the issuance of CNICs
  in rural areas. It is no secret that the government of Sindh only and exclusively
  represents rural Sindh, with a predictable tilt in that direction. Its unchecked
  participation in the census exercise, which, as stated in the preceding paragraph,
  is a Federal subject/entry, occurring in Part II of the Federal Legislative List,
  controlled by Articles 153(4) and 154 (1) (6) ), is likely to produce unacceptable
  results. Aam Loeg Ittehad petition states that there is hue and cry in Balochistan
  that if the current census, in the present situation, is carried out the Baloch
  people shall be relegated to being a minority in their own province. Nothing can
  be farther from the truth. The Baloch people, who are purported to have moved to
  Sindh and Punjab, can easily be counted at their present places of residence.  And
  if some Afghan refugees, in Balochistan, now possess Pakistan CNICs, they can always
  be carefully screened and excluded from the head count of the forthcoming population
  census. Thereafter, their illegal Pakistan CNICs can be replaced by other distinctive
  cards of identification. Much the same is the position in KP, where provincial leaders
  have shown apprehension that if some migrants from Afghanistan, who are unlawfully
  holding Pakistan CNICs, are counted, as part of the population, the Pashtuns would
  be converted into a minority. That also is as illogical a position as taken by the
  Baloch sardars. For one thing, an inflated KP population would bring similar benefits,
  as in the case of Balochistan and in any case the electoral process would remain
  unaffected, as in the case of Balochistan, states the petition. It has been requested
  of the Honorable Court to direct the Federal Government to assume full jurisdiction
  in the matter of the forthcoming census and provide directions and guidance to the
  Council of Common Interests, as and when necessary. The Court has also been appealed
  to direct the Federal and Provincial Governments of Pakistan to ensure full, complete
  and absolute compliance of law and the Constitution in the matter of the forthcoming
  census. Census is not just for the head-count of Pakistani citizens (CNIC holders)
  but of all persons in Pakistan who must be counted on the basis of due and verifiable
  particulars and only after securing due clarification of valid CNIC holders. The
  petition has further requested the Court to issue directions to NADRA, through the
  Chair NADRA to cancel all illegal CNICs and, where needed, to issue other cards/insignias
  for identification of persons holding illegal CNICs. And also to prohibit NADRA
  from issuing new CNICs at least one month prior to the start of the first phase
  of the census. It has also been requested that the Court prohibit all Provincial
  Governments from any and all direct or indirect interaction with the census functionaries,
  and to ensure that no census result is announced until the Armed Forces  component
  of the census personnel expressly approves it. '

heading: Four questions on Iran's legal challenge to US sanctions
language: en
publisher: Geo News
summary: null
tags:

text: 'Iran s legal challenge against renewed sanctions by the United States goes
  before the UN s International Court of Justice on Monday.  Here are four key questions
  regarding the case: What is the case about? Iran s attempt to block the reinstatement
  of sanctions, announced by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, is the latest
  in a series of court battles that Tehran and Washington are fighting at the ICJ.  Trump
  announced on May 8 that he was pulling out of a landmark deal between Iran and major
  powers aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The deal agreed
  with the UN s five permanent Security Council members and Germany in 2015 limits
  Tehran s stockpile of enriched uranium until 2031 in exchange for sanctions relief.
  Blasting the accord as a "horrible, one-sided deal", Trump reimposed a wave of tough,
  unilateral sanctions. Tehran now accuses Washington of "besieging" its economy and
  wants the Hague-based court   which rules in disputes between countries   to order
  the US to temporarily halt punitive measures, while the judges mull the deeper merits
  of the case. Does Tehran have a case? The case has two elements, said Eric De Brabandere,
  professor of international dispute settlement at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
  Firstly, "Iran genuinely considers the re-imposition of sanctions a violation of
  international law." Secondly, "Iran has the support of many European states on the
  question of sanctions, politically speaking," De Brabandere argued. Iran s representatives
  need to convince the ICJ that its 15 permanent judges indeed have the jurisdiction
  to hear the case. Tehran bases its arguments on a little-known 1955 treaty between
  Iran and the United States. The treaty provides for "friendly relations" between
  the two countries, encourages mutual trade and investment and regulates consular
  relations. However, there have been no formal diplomatic ties between Tehran and
  Washington since the regime of the US-backed Shah was deposed by Iran''s revolution
  in 1979. What will Washington argue? "My guess is that for this case they will argue
  that the court has no jurisdiction, as they did in a separate case launched against
  the US two years ago," said De Brabandere. Washington could invoke two arguments.
  One is that the 1955 treaty is no longer in force, because it is a "treaty of friendship"
  between two nations which have been adversaries for the last four decades. Secondly,
  US representatives could say that the dispute was "not about the treaty, but about
  sanctions and Iran s alleged terrorist activities," De Brabandere said. "The US
  is likely to argue that the dispute is about something much broader than a treaty,"
  for instance Tehran s nuclear ambitions, the expert said. Furthermore, there is
  a clause in the 1955 treaty which allows the states to take "any measures to protect
  essential security interests." Can Iran s case succeed? "I think it s very likely
  that the ICJ will, based on the 1955 treaty, decide to hear the case," said De Brabandere.
  However, whether the case will be successful on its own merits -- in other words
  whether the United States indeed breached its obligations -- is more difficult to
  establish. "For one, the 1955 treaty is relatively narrow in scope. It means that
  the ICJ can only rule whether the US violated its obligations under the specific
  treaty," De Brabandere said. This means that the ICJ s judges will not rule in what
  they may consider any broader dispute between Iran and the United States. The outcome
  of the case   which could still take years before being handed down   "is very difficult
  to predict," said De Brabandere. '

  former premier Nawaz Sharif and his family. A three-judge bench headed by Chief
  Justice of Pakistan Justice Mian Saqib Nisar and comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial
  and Justice Ijazul Ahsan heard the petition of accountability court II Judge Mohammad
  Arshad Malik. Earlier on Friday, Judge Malik had submitted a written request to

  references. Judge seeks extension in deadline of references against Sharifs: sources  Last
  time, the Supreme Court had on July 10 extended the deadline by 6 weeks As the hearing
  went under way, the CJP asked to be briefed on the background of the case.  Till
  date I have not taken interest in this case or what the issue is,  he stated. Nawaz

  give the accountability court till December 15 to conclude the remaining two references.
  However, the chief justice observed,  We cannot grant such a long extension.   We
  do not want to interfere in the accountability court s trial,  Justice Nisar remarked
  and granted a six-week extension in the deadline. On July 6, after four extensions
  in the original six-month deadline to conclude all three cases, the court had announced
  its verdict in the Avenfield reference. Accountability court Judge Mohammad Bashir
  had announced the verdict handing the ousted prime minister 10 years as jail time
  and seven years to his daughter Maryam Nawaz. The trial against the Sharif family
  commenced on September 14, 2017. Nawaz and his sons, Hussain and Hasan, are accused
  in all three references whereas Maryam and Safdar were accused in the Avenfield
  reference only. The two brothers, based abroad, have been absconding since the proceedings
  began last year and were declared proclaimed offenders by the court. '

text: 'They were considered the most lethal and devastating fast bowling pair of the
  90 s, a pair that mastered and lifted the art of reverse swing to uncatchable heights.
  One broke feet with his much feared toe-crushers while the other terrorised batsmen
  with his swinging bouncers. They hunted best in pairs and destroyed lineups regardless
  of conditions and oppositions.Their love for the game and bonding together grew
  with every falling wicket, but somehow this happy union was hurt by someone s envious
  wish and the love affair went sour.Who can forget their all conquering smile pose
  during the 92 English tour where they cemented a clear domination over Graham Gooch
  s men. But the very next year sowed the foundation of the great divide amongst the
  two most lethal quickies of modern era.Jawed Miandad was stripped off captaincy
  after the failure of Down Under and Wasim was installed in his place. However, just
  after one series into captaincy against the West Indies, players complained off
  Wasim authoritative behavior and Waqar pulled off a mutiny that included some big
  names in the team. Akram had to resign and Salim Malik was installed as the compromise
  captain.From then onwards, the breach could never be healed and the Demon of Mistrust
  kept rising its ugly face time to time. Friendship amongst the two was all but buried
  and the desire for revenge brewed with every possible opportunity.           Big
  year   Big Fights1999 was the eventful year when differences between the two were
  elevated to the next level. They were hardly at talking terms during the short tour
  of India and poor Inzi had to run around playing the courier guy. But it was the
  World Cup in England where Wasim actually got to test Waqar s nerves.Despite all
  of Wasim s tactics, Waqar somehow did find a place in the touring squad but remained
  mostly on the bench. The fire spitting Shoaib Akthar was at his fiercely best and
  that gave Wasim a good reason to curb his role to a water boy. Waqar only featured
  in the fateful game against Bangladesh while Wasim s dream of walking high like
  Imran Khan were shattered by Kangaroos in the finals.The rivalry resurfaced again
  in the later part of the year when Pakistan faced Australians in their backyard.
  Waqar was made to sit out the first test and Pakistan were hammed with a 10 wicket
  defeat. Waqar by now had passed his boiling point and decided to speak out in the
  press against Wasim, arguing that Akram s long-term grudge was ruining his career
  and the best place to settle that bitterness was inside a room and not on the ground.This
  outburst resulted in Waqar putting on his spikes in the Hobart test. His impact
  was felt immediately when he trapped Mark Waugh, next to follow was his trademark
  in-swinger that removed Rickey Ponting for a duck. The jubilation in Waqar s follow-through
  was a clear reminder for Wasim that he could keep Waqar out of cricket, but certainly
  not cricket out of Waqar. Sadly Waqar faced an ankle injury and sat out the last
  test.Wasim lost the captaincy after the 3-0 drubbing and Waqar got the armband during
  the 2001 England tour. Around this time the whistle blowing Justice Qayyum report
  came out highlighting the Evil of Match Fixing and greed in Pakistan cricket. Apart
  from other suggestions, one was never to let Wasim captain his country again. Wasim
  kept playing under Waqar s captaincy for the next year and a half, but these once
  good friends kept their fiercest revelries saved for the World Cup, neither having
  a heart big enough to let the other capture a permanent place in the countries folklore.2003
  World Cup, tempering the Bad-BloodWasim had a rocking World Cup where he bagged
  3 against Australia in the opening match, and then took 3 against Netherlands to
  reach the magical 500 haul. He couldn t kill any Indian batsmen in the all important
  Centurion game and this was perhaps convinced Waqar of deliberate underperformance.In
  the next game against Zimbabwe, rain sealed Pakistan s early exit from the tournament.
  While the nation was in shock, TV screens showed a relaxed and somewhat content
  looking Wasim standing outside the dressing room and warmly greeting the Zimbabwean
  players, this only added more wood to the already blazing fire.The bitter rivalry
  had cracked yet another cup and the curtain fell simultaneously on the careers of
  two most illustrious fast bowlers of modern times.In April 2004, while India was
  touring Pakistan, Waqar announced his retirement. During a packed News conference
  in an Islamabad hotel, Waqar minced no words in disclosing that he mistrusted a
  Few Friends during the 2003 Cup. His book would reveal the true story and characters.
  Both have maintained that age and maturity has over taken the bitter taste and good
  sense prevails, sadly that s only true till and before the World Cup.For the mega
  event the expectations from Pakistani bowlers were always high, but Waqar s boys
  have so far failed to impact mattering opponents. Wasim is in Australia and has
  repeatedly shown his willingness to shoulder the falling apart bowling line and
  put the spark in their plugs, but perhaps his help is as un-welcoming as his presence
  in the Pakistani dressing room. While Waqar was made to keep towers dry and bottles
  filled during the 99 Cup, he must have kept repeating to himself the basic coaching
  tip,  Wait for the bad ball . It s his time now and he is solely calling the shots
  like the powerful before him did. By keeping Wasim out, his shattered Ego would
  definitely see satisfaction, but it might come at the cost of another broken Cup.                                   '

text: 'Nearly half the world s schools lack clean drinking water, toilets and handwashing
  facilities, putting millions of children at risk of disease, experts warned on Monday.
  Almost 900 million children have to contend with a lack of basic hygiene facilities
  during their education, putting their health at risk and meaning some have to miss
  school.  You can t have a quality learning environment without these basics,  said
  Dr Rick Johnston of the World Health Organization, a lead researcher on the project.  Children
  may not come to school at all if there s no toilets ... Then, when they are at school,
  they are not going to at their very best if they not able to use a decent toilet
  or if they are not properly hydrated.  World leaders have signed up to global pledges
  to provide safe water and hygiene facilities for all and ensure every child gets
  a comprehensive education by 2030 under the UN s sustainable development goals.
  A lack of safe water and sanitation facilities can cause dehydration, illness, and
  even death. But many children are forced to risk their health to take part in classes,
  according to the report produced jointly by the United Nations Children s Fund UNICEF
  and the WHO, the first to look specifically at provision in schools. It found nearly
  a third of primary and secondary schools lacked a safe and reliable drinking water
  supply, affecting nearly 570 million children. Nearly 20 per cent of schools had
  no safe drinking water at all. Just over a third of schools lacked adequate toilet
  facilities, affecting more than 620 million children. Almost one in five primary
  schools and one in eight secondary schools were considered to have no sanitation.
  Nearly half lacked proper handwashing facilities, essential for helping prevent
  the spread of infections and disease. Nearly 900 million children were affected,
  the report found. Sub-Saharan Africa, East and Southeast Asia had some of the worst
  facilities.  It s deeply shocking,  Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of charity
  WaterAid, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The consequences are very broad
  in terms of children s access to education, general health and state of nutrition.  Adolescent
  girls in particular are often forced to miss classes when they are on their periods
  if there are no proper cleaning and sanitation facilities, he said. More than a
  third of girls in South Asia miss school during their periods, often because they
  lack access to toilets or pads, according to a WaterAid and UNICEF study earlier
  this year. The World Bank last year warned countries needed to quadruple spending
  to $150 billion a year to deliver universal safe water and sanitation. However,
  experts say they are optimistic the situation can be quickly improved if leaders
  treat water, sanitation and hygiene as a priority.  With political will, it really
  is possible to deliver good quality services,  said Johnston. '

text: 'United Nations investigators on Monday called for an international probe and
  prosecution of Myanmar''s army chief and five other top military commanders for
  genocide against the country''s Rohingya minority.  "Myanmar''s top military generals,
  including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated
  and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes
  against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States," a UN-backed
  fact-finding mission said. Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled northern Rakhine state
  to Bangladesh after Myanmar launched a brutal crackdown last August on insurgents
  amid accounts of arson, murder and rape at the hands of soldiers and vigilante mobs
  in the mainly Buddhist country. Myanmar has vehemently denied allegations of ethnic
  cleansing, insisting it was responding to attacks by Rohingya rebels.  But in Monday
  s report, the UN mission insisted the army tactics had been "consistently and grossly
  disproportionate to actual security threats." The mission, which was created by
  the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017, concluded in a report that "there is
  sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials
  in the Tatmadaw (Myanmar army) chain of command." "The crimes in Rakhine State,
  and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and
  scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,"
  the report said. The investigators named Min Aung Hlaing and five other top military
  commanders, adding that a longer list of names could be shared with "any competent
  and credible body pursuing accountability in line with international norms and standards."
  Criticism was also directed at Myanmar s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel
  Peace Prize laureate who has been the target of global vitriol for a perceived failure
  to stand up for the stateless minority. The report found that she had "not used
  her de facto position as head of government, nor her moral authority, to stem or
  prevent the unfolding events."  While acknowledging that she and other civilian
  authorities had little influence on military actions, it said that they "through
  their acts and omissions... have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes."
  The investigators called on the UN Security Council to refer the Myanmar situation
  to the International Criminal Court, or for an ad hoc international criminal tribunal
  to be created. They also recommended an arms embargo and "targeted individual sanctions
  against those who appear to be most responsible." '

text: 'Many European Union member states have failed the migrant victims of torture
  and trauma by not having systems in place to recognise the ordeals they have suffered,
  and support them on arrival. Such trauma if left untreated can scar them and their
  families for life, and may lead to suicide. These are some of the findings from
  the latest summary report of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) on migration-related
  fundamental rights concerns in select EU member states. It examines how victims
  are being handled by national authorities to highlight how to best offer them the
  protection they are entitled to. Many migrants and asylum seekers have fled or experienced
  extreme suffering in their home countries or en route to Europe. This includes physical
  and psychological violence, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. Lengthy bureaucracy,
  uncertainty about the outcome of asylum proceedings and poor reception conditions
  can compound their suffering. In Denmark alone, there were 120 suicide attempts
  and incidents of suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in 2016, of which 29 were
  by children. Despite international and EU laws guarding against such treatment offering
  support to victims, many member states are falling short of their duties, the report
  shows. Some of the report s main findings include:  1. The true extent of suffering
  is hard to gauge as only limited data on the victims of torture and trauma and on
  suicide attempts is collected in the 13 member states studied. Only Greece regularly
  collects information on torture victims.  2.  Recurrent violence or the excessive
  use of force by state officials or those working on their behalf was not found although
  there were cases of individual and localised incidents. However, serious incidents
  are more frequent along EU external border zones.  3.  Identifying victims is problematic
  given the lack of formal screening procedures. Instead countries heavily rely on
  the expertise and knowledge of individual staff, although tools are increasingly
  being developed to facilitate identification by non-experts.   4.  Access to support
  is limited by the number of specialised medical staff who can provide psychological
  or psychiatric help. The lack of staff often leads to long waiting periods; for
  example, in Germany around 5,600 asylum seekers waited over a year to receive treatment.
  It is also a challenge starting therapy when asylum applicants are homeless or live
  in reception facilities that are not adequate to sustain the therapy.   5.  Despite
  training, monitoring bodies and complaints mechanisms in all member states, their
  effectiveness in preventing ill-treatment varies from country to country. Despite
  the lack of attention to torture and trauma victims, the report also identifies
  promising practices that other member states could adopt to identify and support
  victims. The European Commission asked the Agency for Fundamental Rights to collect
  data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in member states,
  particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 member
  states: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy,
  the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. '

  \ As for India, Dhoni\u2019s dream run is coming to an end, while his deputy Virat\

text: 'The equation for Pakistan is crystal clear, defeat the South Africans or go
  pack your bags. As the World Cup pool stage approaches its pointy end, both teams
  would look to pocket the all important 2 points, but for different reasons. South
  Africa, for a jab at the top slot, for Pakistan it s a question of survival.While
  fans would love to watch leather bang hard on willow, there are good chances that
  mother nature might step in at Auckland and spoil the fun with possible thundering
  showers.As the big hitters from both sides adjust their grips and the quickies tighten
  their spikes for the cut-through fixture, how about getting a bit nostalgic and
  re-collect some golden moments from days gone by?The Protease and Green shirts have
  fought their battles hard and given fans some memorable treats to cherish. From
  the first time they locked horns at the 92 Cup till the last arm-lock in Centurion,
  it s been all about pure passion, challenge and hunger for success. Keeping such
  history in mind, both teams are expected to produce a lot of bang and smoke on Saturday.Let
  s revisit some moments that refuse to leave our collections.1. Jhonty steals Inzi
  and the three Stumps   Crickets Superman hits the groundWe have all seen it hundreds
  of times and still never get tired of it, probably the most spectacular moment from
  a cricket field. The iconic image of the airborne Jhonty, horizontal to the last
  limb, flying through the air and defying laws of gravity to demolish all three stumps.
  A mind boggling stunt that would make even the legendary Christopher Reeve bite
  his fingers.The magical moment was captured by famed cricket photographer Patrick
  Eager and became a part of the games folklore. Jhonty recognition before the run
  out was limited to that of a struggling middle order batsman who wasn t contributing
  enough runs but would save 20 odd runs in fielding. But that one picture changed
  his existence.Ask him today and Jhonty is still unsure if it was his leap against
  gravity or the click of the camera that made him the poster boy of World Cricket.2.
  Waqar Younis 4-62 at Sharjah Cup Final   The return of the wounded TigerWhat a match
  for fans, what a match for Pakistan and what a match for Waqar Younis it was. Being
  thrashed by Australia in the tour Down under, Wasim Akram was dethroned from Captaincy
  and Pakistan came to play the Sharjah Cup under a new leader, Moin Khan.Waqar was
  kept on the side lines by Wasim and it was his time to hit back. Although he had
  a rocking tournament, but the Burewala Express kept his best for the finals against
  the mighty South Africans. Defending a total of 263, Waqar s middle order burst
  kept a check on the Protease and gave Moin Khan his first tournament win as a captain.And
  not to forget from the same match was Inzaman s cracking off drive that nearly blew
  Nantie Haywards head.3. Afridi s Flying Kiss to Jacque Kallis   Kallis Chaumma DedeAs
  the old saying goes, you can expect anything from Shahid Afridi, but here was an
  act as bizarre as it can get. It was the Semifinal of the T-20 WC at Nottingham,
  Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat. The last ball of the 4th over, Afridi
  wacked a short one from Kallis over wide midwicket for four.It was one of the hundreds
  of boundaries Afridi struck in his career, but what he did next caught every one
  off guard and astonished Kallis. Out of the blue, Afridi blew him a kiss but Kallis
  wasn t thrilled. This was tempting food for TV channels who did not miss a chance
  to milk out ratings. The foot tapping Amitabh hit  Jumma Chaumma Dede  blended perfectly
  and also generated thousand of hits on YouTube.4. Abdul Razzaq s rampant century
  at Abu DhabiPakistan had lost the first match and badly needed a win to bounce back
  in the series. Same was the case with Razzaq who was ping ponged in and out of the
  team. Chasing a target of 286, Pakistan were bruised at 5-136 when Razzaq took guard.
  It was the perfect setting for Razzaq who grabbed the opportunity with both hands
  and showered a 72 ball 109 that included 10 sixes and 7 fours. In his own words,
  this was the most memorable and fighting innings he ever played.5.Fanie de Villiers
  Cycling joy and Hansie Cronje s Tanga jockey funWe have all seem them; we have all
  lived through them. Pakistan has seen much better days then the ones currently flashed
  to the world. Foreign teams used to visit Pakistan multiple times every year, they
  used to play hard and rubbishing aside the cultural shock syndrome, used to merge
  and enjoy the tastes of Pakistan s rich and colorful culture. Every time Pakistan
  play their home series in UAE, the images of Fanie de Villiers enjoying his cycle
  ride in Faisalabad s Famous  Ghanta Ghar Chowk , or the Late Hansie Cronje hacking
  the Tanga at Rawalpindi s  Raja Bazar , remind of the golden days of Pakistan Cricket.
  The smile of their faces tells the complete story, how secure and welcomed they
  felt in the land of pure.Only South Africa can fell Pakistan s pain, they themselves
  suffered international isolation for 27 years and went through the painful apartheid
  segregation. Only they can realize the agony behind empty stands and dusty grounds.
  They have helped us before, they could again stretch their hands and allow Pakistani
  fans to make some noise in those empty stands.                                                         '

text: "LONDON: Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) branch of the\
  \ Pakistan Army, Major General Asim Bajwa addressed the Royal United Services Institute\
  \ (RUSI), a leading think tank in London on Thursday. The DG ISPR, spoke on the\
  \ role of the Pakistan Army in countering terrorism, rendering great sacrifices.\
  \ He explained how the army freed areas from Taliban control adding that the strategic\
  \ objective was to deny them use of Pakistan\u2019s territory to achieve lasting\
  \ peace.Bajwa told the think tank in his address, that with the aim of eliminating\
  \ terrorism and ending militant links in the area to establish the writ of the state\
  \ and to improve governance in the area, the army began its operation from the North\
  \ in Bajaur agency and made its way down. He recalled how Swat was taken over by\
  \ terrorists and how the army went in to eliminate them after the Tehrik-e-Taliban\
  \ Pakistan (TTP) began flogging people meting out their brand of justice. The operation\
  \ was lauded by the United Nations as the most successful operation. Zarb-e-AzbBajwa\
  \ shared, that the government made efforts to negotiate with the terrorists to address\
  \ the matter through dialogue, but that didn't help. Then the terrorists attacked\
  \ one of the country\u2019s major airports in Karachi which was a defining point\
  \ to launch Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Prior to the launch of operation Zarb-e-Azb, Bajwa\
  \ added, the Army Chief issued clear instructions that the operation will be against\
  \ terrorists of all hues and colour without any discrimination. That collateral\
  \ damage must be avoided even at the cost of delayed progress in the operation and\
  \ that no human rights violations should take place. He explained that Operation\
  \ Zarb-e-Azb is not an end in itself, it is a national effort involving all segments\
  \ of Pakistani society determined to root out terrorism from Pakistan and it aims\
  \ at restoring the writ of the government through use of military intervention,\
  \ destroying safe-havens and terrorist hideouts, eliminating all kinds of terrorists.Bajwa\
  \ shared, that Operation Zarb-e-Azb is continuing successfully. As a result over\
  \ 2000 terrorists have been killed in North Waziristan and elsewhere, he added that\
  \ the price being paid is also high, over 200 soldiers have laid down their lives\
  \ and nearly 800 have been injured. Bajwa added, that the Army has dismantled the\
  \ terror economy, their funding sources need to be choked he added that their finances\
  \ must be choked to end the reign of terror. Situation in North WaziristanBajwa\
  \ explained that the Taliban were using safe havens in North Waziristan to operate,\
  \ they had communication systems, were manufacturing bombs and explosive material\
  \ for their nefarious terror objectives. Border CrossingDue to Pakistan\u2019s porous\
  \ borders, Bajwa said, the Taliban were able to cross over to Afghanistan due to\
  \ their existing links. He added, that ISAF and the Afghan security forces were\
  \ informed well before the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb about the border-crossing\
  \ and in some cases they met with success while in others they are still struggling.\
  \ Khyber AgencyThe DG ISPR explains that the Army went into Khyber Agency to clear\
  \ the area and to sever links that the terrorists were trying to reestablish, adding\
  \ that they met with success due to good cooperation with the Afghan and ISAF forces.\
  \ Bajwa added, that when forces went in, they discovered that the terrorists were\
  \ very well equipped and would have been able to cause great damage. Rehabilitation\
  \ InitiativesBajwa told the think tank, that Pakistan has started various social\
  \ economic development projects within the tribal areas to bring dividends to the\
  \ locals through trade and economic development, adding that a general trade corridor\
  \ has been created to expedite trade.Pakistan is addressing the root causes of the\
  \ problem and is initiating projects in fields of education, rehabilitating schools,\
  \ reviewing the curriculum and enabling young girls to attend schools.Bajwa said,\
  \ Pakistan is grateful to its friends from across the world, the donors who are\
  \ helping our efforts, their help is much appreciated, adding that a comprehensive\
  \ plan is in place to look after the IDP\u2019s and rehabilitate them as soon as\
  \ possible which includes cooperation with all relevant civilian agencies.  Border\
  \ IssuesOn the issue of Pakistan\u2019s porous border, Bajwa explained, that it\
  \ was difficult to seal the Eastern border with Afghanistan and the border with\
  \ Iran, adding that was a big challenge. He added that Pakistan has a 3000 km Eastern\
  \ border with India and others. He shared that Pakistan\u2019s neighbours keep hurling\
  \ allegations. He said border violations from India are distracting Pakistan from\
  \ the task we have on the western side, we have shown lots of restraint. Pakistan\
  \ has been offering peace while India has shown arrogance. They cancelled secretary\
  \ level talks, accused Pakistan wrongly adding that there is a method to their madness.\
  \ They are trying to distract our attention, while we want peace and we have offered\
  \ it many times. He said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has gone to great lengths.\
  \ He met Narendra Modi and our foreign office went out of the way, we offered DG\
  \ level talks. It helped to some extent, but what do you do when there is military\
  \ violation and then they blame Pakistan instead \u2013 that doesn\u2019t help,\
  \ he added. Bajwa said, things are right there for everyone to see adding that Pakistan\
  \ expects everyone to play their role to bring peace. India needs to understand,\
  \ that Pakistan is not oblivious to what is happening in India. There is the festering\
  \ wound of the unresolved issue of Kashmir, it is one of the major issues n the\
  \ way of peace between India and Pakistan. BalochistanOn the issue of Balochistan,\
  \ the DG ISPR explained that it is a national problem and that Pakistan has been\
  \ raising the issue of external interference at every level. He said, the porous\
  \ nature of the border hinders full control of the state adding that Baloch militants\
  \ have links and bases inside Afghanistan where Ferrari camps are present. He explained\
  \ that militancy of this nature cannot sustain without external influence for long\
  \ without financing from abroad and that much of it was taking place as a result\
  \ of foreign help but said he did not want to name any country. Military CourtsOn\
  \ the issue of military courts, Bajwa said, that the entire justice system has not\
  \ come under military domain, explaining that military courts are a stop gap arrangement\
  \ due to the existing capacity issue of Pakistan\u2019s judicial system. He clarified\
  \ that military courts will only deal with terrorists. Madrasa ReformsThe decision\
  \ to reform madrasa\u2019s has been taken against those seminaries that abet and\
  \ facilitate terrorists or those who sympathize with terrorists. He added, that\
  \ warrants against Maulana Aziz (the Lal Masjid cleric) have been issued and that\
  \ it was only a matter of execution now. He said, the government has taken its decision\
  \ against terrorism adding that everything does not happen overnight. The government\
  \ is serious about dealing with anyone who sympathizes with or promotes terrorism\
  \ in any form, he added."

  \ you put up a brave face and hold back your tears when you helplessly see your\

  \ back when your skills are questioned and your effectiveness challenged?You do\
  \ exactly what Sarfaraz Ahmed did, put all negativities aside, sharpen your claws,\
  \ smell blood and go for the kill. Whenever the great Tiger Woods faced the raciest\
  \ taunts, he remembered his mother\u2019s life changing lesson, \u201CSon, let your\
  \ stick do the talking\u201D. Sarfaraz, probably unaware of the famous quote, still\
  \ managed to pick the message and silenced his critics by a captivating performance\
  \ that would be hard to match in modern times.Just think for a moment, was there\
  \ anything going in his favour? Absolutely nothing! It was his first World Cup match\
  \ and his first appearance in the tournament and his confidence was shattered by\
  \ missing the first four matches. Coach Waqar Younis infected more dents by questioning\
  \ his technique and above all, the match was played in the over cast conditions\
  \ of Eden Park, famous for being a torturing dungeon for batsmen. Yet he still walked\
  \ out invictus, reliving the true spirit of Imran Khan\u2019s Cornered Tiger, never\
  \ giving up, refusing to go down and fighting till the last breath.This is how we\
  \ know Sarfaraz Ahmed, the Cricket Warrior born and sharpened on the tough and rugged\
  \ streets of Karachi. A proud graduate of Rashid Latif\u2019s School of wicket-keeping\
  \ techniques and mental strength.But for anyone arguing that his performance was\
  \ just a one off spectacular, needs to revisit his battle-hardened attitude in whatever\
  \ little chances that came his way. At the 2012 Asia Cup final in Mirpur, he top\
  \ scored with a commanding 69 ball 46, including the crucial 13 in the final over\
  \ that helped Pakistan overcome a spirited fight from Bangladesh.Being dumped in\
  \ and out like an extra luggage piece, it was the year 2014 that gave Sarfaraz a\
  \ decent run and the Braveheart responded by maturing into a genuine match-winner.\
  \ He is the first Pakistani wicketkeeper to score three hundreds in one year.But\
  \ let\u2019s not forget that he is first a keeper and then anything else. In an\
  \ era when Pakistan Cricket has been hostage to the slips and misses of the Umar\
  \ Akmal Trilogy, its Sarfaraz\u2019s dependable glove work that has proved to be\
  \ a safe haven for Pakistani bowlers.Had he not been replaced, just imagine the\
  \ mess Akmal would have made off Hashim Amla\u2019s nudge.Like countless sad stories\
  \ of dumping and nepotism in Pakistan Cricket, Sarfaraz is no stranger to hardships\
  \ and baseless criticism. Often sidelined for unexplained reasons, the street fighter\
  \ has the habit of crawling his way back through some stellar performances.Some\
  \ circles scared of his skills and leadership qualities have discouraged and deliberately\
  \ tried to keep him out of the team. During a recent tour, his visa was purposely\
  \ delayed and a fellow keeper kept on telling him that he will be replacing Sarfaraz\
  \ on the tour. Sarfaraz eventually went on the tour, though he was dropped soon\
  \ afterwards without given right opportunities.Right after the 2012 Asia Cup, he\
  \ was dubbed as \u201CNot a good enough batsman\u201D and was dropped from the next\
  \ outing.A further shock came with him not being awarded the Central Contract.Expecting\
  \ Better from a CoachLet\u2019s admit it, Sarfaraz proved the Think Tank completely\
  \ wrong. In another setting, the Coach or captain would have erupted with joy and\
  \ shower laurels on his young gun, but remember this is Team Pakistan, where personal\
  \ egos have always been much larger than the game.There was no point in Waqar walking\
  \ alone for the press conference; honestly, he hadn\u2019t done much to deserve\
  \ a chat with the media about this feat (he puts Misbah to the cannons whenever\
  \ the team loses). His only right move was to let Sarfaraz play, but only after\
  \ facing ruthless criticism and shouldering some scratchy performances from his\
  \ beloveds.Rather, it was Sarfaraz\u2019s day, he had earned it. It was he who deserved\
  \ to pose a winning smile for the cameras. It was his feelings and experience that\
  \ were of interest to fans and media scribes around the world. Sadly, he was deprived\
  \ of the opportunity and Waqar engineered an unnecessary controversy.Interestingly,\
  \ Waqar has time and again accused Wasim Akram of sabotaging his carrier. It\u2019\
  s strange to see him handing the same treatment to the young and controversy free\
  \ Sarfaraz. Waqar needs to realise that like a boomerang thrown correctly, a deserving\
  \ player will only bring back the laurels to him.Hopefully, things will change for\
  \ Sarfaraz now.He has shown his toughness and lethality and expectations would be\
  \ high from him, but as the saying goes, \u201CWhen the going gets tough, the tough\
  \ get going\u201D. The fear of failure and being dropped again would keep pushing\
  \ him for more and each winning performance would be a question for his coach, if\
  \ he had done enough?"

text: 'LAHORE: The National College of Arts in Lahore on Friday announced a week''s
  holiday, after which the hostel administration ordered students to immediately vacate
  their dormitories. The NCA administration ordered students to vacate three hostels;
  two for boys and a girls'' dormitory. With this, around 300 students, male and female,
  have been stranded due to administration negligence. All of these students come
  from distant cities and areas in the province, while some hail from outside Punjab.
  Geo News has learnt that police had given a notice to hostel administration a week
  ago. They said that they had repeatedly asked the administration to improve security,
  before finally getting the hostels vacated tonight upon non-compliance of orders
  by admin staff. Reached for comment, hostel administration declined the request.
  Police said the hostels will not be reopened until adequate security arrangements
  are made. The situation also perplexed the parents of the students, who questioned
  where would their children go at this hour of night. The students, outside the hostels,
  were found calling their relatives and friends in Lahore in search of a temporary
  place to stay at. No institute asked to get hostels vacated: DIG On the other hand,
  DIG Operations Lahore Haider Ashraf denied that the police asked NCA administration
  to get the hostels vacated. "We have not asked administration of any educational
  institution to get its hostels vacated," Ashraf said, adding that police were providing
  foolproof security to all institutes. '

  \ shared, that Operation Zarb-e-Azb is continuing successfully. As a result over\
  \ 2000 terrorists have been killed in North Waziristan and elsewhere, he added that\
  \ the price being paid is also high, over 200 soldiers have laid down their lives\
  \ and nearly 800 have been injured. Bajwa added, that the Army has dismantled the\
  \ terror economy, their funding sources need to be choked he added that their finances\
  \ must be choked to end the reign of terror. Situation in North WaziristanBajwa\
  \ explained that the Taliban were using safe havens in North Waziristan to operate,\
  \ they had communication systems, were manufacturing bombs and explosive material\
  \ for their nefarious terror objectives. Border CrossingDue to Pakistan\u2019s porous\
  \ borders, Bajwa said, the Taliban were able to cross over to Afghanistan due to\
  \ their existing links. He added, that ISAF and the Afghan security forces were\
  \ informed well before the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb about the border-crossing\
  \ and in some cases they met with success while in others they are still struggling.\
  \ Khyber AgencyThe DG ISPR explains that the Army went into Khyber Agency to clear\
  \ the area and to sever links that the terrorists were trying to reestablish, adding\
  \ that they met with success due to good cooperation with the Afghan and ISAF forces.\
  \ Bajwa added, that when forces went in, they discovered that the terrorists were\
  \ very well equipped and would have been able to cause great damage. Rehabilitation\
  \ InitiativesBajwa told the think tank, that Pakistan has started various social\
  \ economic development projects within the tribal areas to bring dividends to the\
  \ locals through trade and economic development, adding that a general trade corridor\
  \ has been created to expedite trade.Pakistan is addressing the root causes of the\
  \ problem and is initiating projects in fields of education, rehabilitating schools,\
  \ reviewing the curriculum and enabling young girls to attend schools.Bajwa said,\
  \ Pakistan is grateful to its friends from across the world, the donors who are\
  \ helping our efforts, their help is much appreciated, adding that a comprehensive\
  \ plan is in place to look after the IDP\u2019s and rehabilitate them as soon as\
  \ possible which includes cooperation with all relevant civilian agencies.  Border\
  \ IssuesOn the issue of Pakistan\u2019s porous border, Bajwa explained, that it\
  \ was difficult to seal the Eastern border with Afghanistan and the border with\
  \ Iran, adding that was a big challenge. He added that Pakistan has a 3000 km Eastern\
  \ border with India and others. He shared that Pakistan\u2019s neighbours keep hurling\
  \ allegations. He said border violations from India are distracting Pakistan from\
  \ the task we have on the western side, we have shown lots of restraint. Pakistan\
  \ has been offering peace while India has shown arrogance. They cancelled secretary\
  \ level talks, accused Pakistan wrongly adding that there is a method to their madness.\
  \ They are trying to distract our attention, while we want peace and we have offered\
  \ it many times. He said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has gone to great lengths.\
  \ He met Narendra Modi and our foreign office went out of the way, we offered DG\
  \ level talks. It helped to some extent, but what do you do when there is military\
  \ violation and then they blame Pakistan instead \u2013 that doesn\u2019t help,\
  \ he added. Bajwa said, things are right there for everyone to see adding that Pakistan\
  \ expects everyone to play their role to bring peace. India needs to understand,\
  \ that Pakistan is not oblivious to what is happening in India. There is the festering\
  \ wound of the unresolved issue of Kashmir, it is one of the major issues n the\
  \ way of peace between India and Pakistan. BalochistanOn the issue of Balochistan,\
  \ the DG ISPR explained that it is a national problem and that Pakistan has been\
  \ raising the issue of external interference at every level. He said, the porous\
  \ nature of the border hinders full control of the state adding that Baloch militants\
  \ have links and bases inside Afghanistan where Ferrari camps are present. He explained\
  \ that militancy of this nature cannot sustain without external influence for long\
  \ without financing from abroad and that much of it was taking place as a result\
  \ of foreign help but said he did not want to name any country. Military CourtsOn\
  \ the issue of military courts, Bajwa said, that the entire justice system has not\
  \ come under military domain, explaining that military courts are a stop gap arrangement\
  \ due to the existing capacity issue of Pakistan\u2019s judicial system. He clarified\
  \ that military courts will only deal with terrorists. Madrasa ReformsThe decision\
  \ to reform madrasa\u2019s has been taken against those seminaries that abet and\
  \ facilitate terrorists or those who sympathize with terrorists. He added, that\
  \ warrants against Maulana Aziz (the Lal Masjid cleric) have been issued and that\
  \ it was only a matter of execution now. He said, the government has taken its decision\
  \ against terrorism adding that everything does not happen overnight. The government\
  \ is serious about dealing with anyone who sympathizes with or promotes terrorism\
  \ in any form, he added."

text: 'JAKARTA: China s Su Bingtian was crowned Asia s fastest man on Sunday, justifying
  the hype surrounding him by winning the blue riband 100 metres sprint gold in an
  Asian Games record time.  Su became the first Asian-born sprinter to run the distance
  in under 10 seconds in June when he clocked 9.91 twice in the space of eight days,
  matching the Asian record held by Qatar s Nigerian-born Femi Ogunode. On Sunday,
  he held off his opponents with a late burst of speed to win the event in 9.92 seconds,
  ahead of Nigerian-born Qatari Tosin Ogunode, who clocked 10.00, on a hot and humid
  night in the Indonesian capital.  It wasn t about the time, it was about getting
  the win,  Su, 28, told reporters.  I knew that if I got a good start then I can
  t be beaten.  Japan s Ryota Yamagata was credited with the same time as Ogunode
  and won bronze. Indonesian teenager Lalu Muhammad Zohri ran a personal best of 10.20
  but it was good enough for only seventh spot. The crowd at the Gelora Bung Karno
  Stadium was in for a surprise in the women s 100m final when Nigerian-born Edidiong
  Odiong of Bahrain was adjudged the winner in a photo-finish over India s Dutee Chand,
  who lost her lead in the last few metres. The 21-year-old Odiong clocked 11.30 to
  be crowned Asia s fastest woman. Chand was cleared to race in 2015 following a Court
  of Arbitration for Sport ruling on gender testing guidelines. The Lausanne-based
  court suspended the governing International Association of Athletics Federations  regulations
  regarding hyperandrogenism, a condition which produces high testosterone levels
  allowing Chand to compete again after a year sat out. Pre-race favourite Wei Yongli
  of China, who recently became the first Asian woman to break the 11-second barrier,
  had topped the timings in Saturday s heats and also the semi-finals but had to be
  satisfied with a bronze. Sudan-born Abdalelah Hassan gave Qatar its first gold medal
  at the 18th Asian Games in the men s 400m, finishing ahead of India s Muhammed Anas
  in 44.89 seconds. Ali Khamis won the bronze for Bahrain. Salwa Naser maintained
  Bahrain s hold on the women s 400m, following in the footsteps of Kemi Adekoya,
  who won the event in Incheon, South Korea, four years ago. The Nigerian-born Naser,
  who won silver at the world championships last year, comfortably won in an Asian
  Games record time of 50.09. India s Hima Das, the under-20 world champion, won silver
  while Elina Mikhina claimed bronze for Kazakhstan. Women s shot put world champion
  Gong Lijiao and Gao Yang made it a one-two for China although Gong s distance of
  19.66m was over two metres more than her compatriot. China has now won gold in the
  women s shot put at each of the last 11 Asian Games, dating back to 1978. China
  also took the top two positions in the men s long jump when Wang Jianan and Zhang
  Yaoguang won the gold and silver medals respectively. Bahrain also had their one-two
  moment on the night when Moroccan-born Hassan Chani and Kenyan-born Abraham Cheroben
  won the gold and silver respectively in the men s 10,000m. India s Govindan Lakshmanan
  won the bronze but was later disqualified for stepping off the track during the
  race. Jung Hye-lim won the women s 100m hurdles to give South Korea their first
  Asiad gold in athletics in eight years. Silver medallist Emilia Nova became the
  first Indonesian woman to win a track medal since Supriati Sutono s 5000m gold in
  1998.  This silver medal means a lot. Two weeks ago my hip flexor hurt but the past
  week I managed the pain. Because of the Asian Games, I just ignored the pain,  Nova
  said. '

text: '  KARAK: Five of a family were killed in a road accident on Indus Highway near
  Hamidan Chowk in Karak in the early hours of Monday.  According to the police, the
  accident occurred as a coaster and car collided. People riding in the car died on
  the spot, while those in the coasters got minor injuries.  The deceased belonged
  to the same family and were residents of North Waziristan. They were en route to
  Peshawar from Bannu, while the coaster was going towards Lakki Marwat from Peshawar.  Police
  said accident was a cause of speeding on the highway.  A day earlier, five of a
  family were killed as their car hit the wall of an under-construction bridge in
  Gujar Khan tehsil of Rawalpindi. Rescue sources said the deceased include a man,
  his wife and three daughters. The accident had left one of the three daughters injured.
  She was rushed to the hospital but succumbed to her wounds there. The family was
  en route to Islamabad from Chakwal when the accident occurred. Road accidents on
  long routes are a common occurrence in Pakistan. In June, at least 10 of a family
  were killed and four others injured after a jeep plunged into a ravine in Mansehra''s
  tehsil Balakot. Earlier this year, on January 15 four people, including three women
  and a child, were killed after a car fell into a ditch in Upper Dir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

text: "To be part of a world cup squad remains the pinnacle in any player\u2019s career,\
  \ but to miss the berth is an agonizing pain that not only hurts deep inside, but\
  \ keeps resurging for times to come. While most of our favorite stars are trying\
  \ to acclimatize with the punishing Down-Under demands, here is a look at the few\
  \ who would be forced to watch the games on television and mediate over missed chances.\
  \ Readers might not be in total agreement with my selection and would chip in alternatives,\
  \ but I have a strong belief that the players mentioned are still match winners\
  \ on their day. If given a chance they would sweat enough to fit in national shirts.1-\
  \ Alastair Cook2014 wasn't a year Cook would keep in his memory; the former England\
  \ skipper could only manage 523 runs in 20 matches at a mediocre average of 27.52.\
  \ To add salt to his wounds, back to back defeats against India and then Sri-Lanka\
  \ cut loose his arm band. This double jolt of form and luck convinced the selectors\
  \ to put faith in the young and charismatic Eoin Morgan.2-Kamran AkmalThe elder\
  \ Akmal is probably the most interesting player of his times. While most teams would\
  \ gladly offer him the opening slot, handing him the keeper\u2019s gloves needs\
  \ a lion\u2019s heart. He has been missing from ODI action since June 2013 but that\
  \ would be of little concern as he carries bundles of experience tasting Australian\
  \ pitches and modern pacers. Initially part of Pakistan\u2019s 30 member Squad,\
  \ Karman lost his place and popularity to the young and fearless Sarfaraz.3-Kevin\
  \ PietersenProbably the most dominating and explosive cricketer of the modern era,\
  \ the past year has been tough for the fire-eating stroke maker. A poor avg of 29.40\
  \ during the Ashes down under made the selector\u2019s job easy. For a high maintenance\
  \ player like him, even a few low scores are enough to raise questions. Last wearing\
  \ the England shirt in September 2013, KP has been creating havoc in cricket leagues\
  \ around the world and specially the Big Bash.4-Yuvraj SinghThe True \u201CRock-Star\u201D\
  \ of International cricket and a heartthrob to millions, 2015 Would Cup will surely\
  \ miss the beloved Yuvi. The Hero of the previous edition failed to appear in any\
  \ ODI in 2014 and had an average stint in IPL. The lowest point came when Yuvi failed\
  \ to cut into initial 30. Regardless of this rusty performance, Yuvi is one player\
  \ who\u2019s spark shines at the highest level, a ticking bomb that can go off exactly\
  \ when needed. Dhoni\u2019s 11 would definitely miss a match winner in their ranks.5-Fawad\
  \ AlamFawad Alam is undoubted Pakistan\u2019s hidden gem and at the same time, their\
  \ Unsolved puzzle. Forced into oblivion for a good 3 years, Fawad burst into match\
  \ winning performances when given a chance at the Asia Cup. His sparkling come back\
  \ was a huge surprise, big enough only to be matched by his omission from the world\
  \ cup. Milking 345 runs from 8 matches at a healthy avg of 43, Fawad suddenly became\
  \ the darling of the nation. His Vadera looking mustache and sticking-in approach\
  \ fetched back the much needed stability in the waggling middle order. In a batting\
  \ line up that\u2019s always ready to choke, one can only hope that Pakistan made\
  \ the right decision by leaving out their Iron-Wall.6-Dwayne BravoA maverick all\
  \ rounder, Bravo is missing the world cup seat for reasons purely beyond the boundary.\
  \ West Indian players have had a long prevailing payment dispute with their board\
  \ and Bravo; along with Kevin Pollard were the latest to feel the heat. Bravo faced\
  \ the music for leading the revolt and was replaced by former skipper Darren Sammy.7-Ryan\
  \ HarrisHave Australia made a blunder by not picking the blue chip Harris? Only\
  \ time will tell. Nicknamed Rhino for his hulking figure and tear-apart approach,\
  \ Harris makes a formidable opening bowling pair with Mitchell Johnson, one many\
  \ openers would least like to face. Despite some impressive performance, Australian\
  \ selectors\u2019 weren\u2019t convinced that the 35 year olds injury prone body\
  \ would survive the toil of the World Cup. They appeared more interested in handing\
  \ him the ball for the upcoming Ashes.8-James NeeshamNew Zealand stirred a storm\
  \ by dropping James Neesham and picking the long forgotten Gant Elliot. The magnitude\
  \ of this jolt could only be matched with Pakistan\u2019s dragging of Sohail Khan\
  \ from international oblivion. The debate against Nasham raised the fact that his\
  \ best performances came in test matches and his replacement Elliot would bring\
  \ solidity to the batting line.9-Ajantha MendisThe maestro that gave us the mystery\
  \ \u201CCarrom Ball\u201D and is remembered best for tormenting the Indian Team.\
  \ He might not be as effective as the time he emerged, but still remains a lethal\
  \ force in the shorter formats where batsmen don\u2019t have much time to adjust\
  \ to his variations. He is one of the 6 players overlooked by the Islanders for\
  \ the Cup. This cut could eventually mean an end to his illustrious but often up\
  \ and down career.10-Saeed AjmalThe story of Ajmal is the saddest of the Cup. Had\
  \ it not been for the suspected arm action, Ajmal would have been the Hercules for\
  \ Pakistan. Baffled with fitness issues, Ajmal\u2019s emission could stretch the\
  \ cup further away from the Green Shirts. Always a lethal force to reckon with,\
  \ Ajmal has been re-structuring his action ever since English umpire Ian Gould brought\
  \ his action under the microscope.11-Umer GulGul, undoubtedly Pakistan\u2019s most\
  \ experience bowler has been battling with a long aggravating knee injury. Operated\
  \ in May, Gul was recalled for the series against Sri-Lanka where the pain resurfaced\
  \ and turned chronic during the New Zealand series. Gul has maintained that he is\
  \ fit for the highest level, but somehow failed to satisfy the selectors. The architect\
  \ of the 2009 T-20 triumph and countless memorable moments, the world\u2019s best\
  \ dearth bowler will surely be missed.Robin Peterson \u2013 12th Man. It would be\

  woman, a resident of Rawalpindi, who was trafficked after being abducted.  CJP Justice
  Mian Saqib Nisar has sought a report on the case from the inspector general of police
  in Islamabad and the Punjab government within three days.   The issue was taken
  up after the case was mentioned in a recently published article of The News titled
  ''Women trafficking in twin cities goes unchecked'' and in Daily Jang titled ''Sub
  goongay kiyoon hogaye''. The articles mention the case of a 40-year-old woman, mother
  of three children and resident of Rawalpindi, who was sold to different people,
  eventually reaching Afghanistan, after she was abducted. The abductors demanded
  Rs300,000 to return her, while the police said they could not do anything to expedite
  the pace of progress in the case. The story added a large number of women were sold
  from Pakistan by an organised gang of 150 members who arrange fake marriages of
  these women. Published on January 1, the story stated that FIR of the case was registered
  at Airport Police Station in Rawalpindi, but the filing of the case has so far gone
  in vain as police have been using delaying tactics. The woman''s husband reported
  receiving a phone call from a man in Afghanistan who asked him for Rs300,000 to
  release his wife. He said he would otherwise sell the woman to someone else. Being
  a daily wager, the husband said he could barely feed his children with his earning
  how would he pay such a huge amount for the release of his wife. According to her
  husband, the woman told him she was sold to an aged person in marriage, but when
  she told him she was married and had kids, he returned her to the agent, taking
  his money back. According to her husband, the woman told him she was sold to an

  tracking families from low-income backgrounds, promising them to get their daughters
  married and offering a handsome amount as well. Once the parents agree, they sell
  the women either in Afghanistan or within the country. The gang members have sold
  many Pakistani girls in Afghanistan or Afghan girls in Pakistan, by solemnising
  phone nikkah by a registrar, usually the prayer leader of a mosque, on a commission
  of Rs5,000 per nikkah.  An older adult woman, residing in Swabi, runs the gang s
  activities in Afghanistan. She takes the women with her to Jalalabad and sells them
  to Afghan agents. The gang keeps on changing their houses so as not be traced by

  forms of malnutrition that include under five stunting and anaemia among women during
  the child bearing years.The first ever Global Nutrition Report that tracks the progress
  of 193 member countries of the United Nations in improving their nutrition status
  also identified Pakistan beginning to encounter the problem of adult obesity and
  related matters. The authors of the report launched at the 2nd International Conference
  on Nutrition (ICN2) have also assessed the progress against the six global World
  Health Assembly nutrition targets that include reducing child stunting and wasting
  anaemia in women of reproductive age and low birth weight preventing a worsening
  of child overweight and increasing exclusive breastfeeding of infants.With urban
  transition and changing lifestyles Pakistan is now facing a mixed pattern of malnutrition
  with high rates of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies among poor women
  and children as well as increasing rates of overweight and obesity among adults
  said Dr Zulfiqar Bhutta.The senior pediatrician and one of the authors of the report
  along with his colleagues had examined the impact on stunting and wasting in Bangladesh
  Ethiopia and Pakistan of scaling up coverage of key nutrition specific programmes
  plus interventions related to optimising birth intervals and improving water sanitation
  and hygiene. The results showed that by scaling up key interventions the model estimates
  reductions in the prevalence of stunting of 17 per cent 21 percent and 18 percent
  from 2013 to 2025 in Bangladesh Ethiopia and Pakistan respectively. Predicted reductions
  in the prevalence of severe wasting were estimated at 65 percent 62 percent and
  58 percent respectively.The impacts on severe wasting are particularly noteworthy
  whereas the estimated declines in stunting are modest and signal the need to increase
  both the coverage and quality of these interventions.Prof Zulfiqar Bhutta also the
  founding director of the Centre for Excellence in Women and Child Health at Aga
  Khan University said scientists and public health specialists at AKU are engaged
  in testing and implementing innovations and low cost solutions to address the problems

  pack your bags. As the World Cup pool stage approaches its pointy end, both teams
  would look to pocket the all important 2 points, but for different reasons. South
  Africa, for a jab at the top slot, for Pakistan it s a question of survival.While
  fans would love to watch leather bang hard on willow, there are good chances that
  mother nature might step in at Auckland and spoil the fun with possible thundering
  showers.As the big hitters from both sides adjust their grips and the quickies tighten
  their spikes for the cut-through fixture, how about getting a bit nostalgic and
  re-collect some golden moments from days gone by?The Protease and Green shirts have
  fought their battles hard and given fans some memorable treats to cherish. From
  the first time they locked horns at the 92 Cup till the last arm-lock in Centurion,
  it s been all about pure passion, challenge and hunger for success. Keeping such
  history in mind, both teams are expected to produce a lot of bang and smoke on Saturday.Let
  s revisit some moments that refuse to leave our collections.1. Jhonty steals Inzi
  and the three Stumps   Crickets Superman hits the groundWe have all seen it hundreds
  of times and still never get tired of it, probably the most spectacular moment from
  a cricket field. The iconic image of the airborne Jhonty, horizontal to the last
  limb, flying through the air and defying laws of gravity to demolish all three stumps.
  A mind boggling stunt that would make even the legendary Christopher Reeve bite
  his fingers.The magical moment was captured by famed cricket photographer Patrick
  Eager and became a part of the games folklore. Jhonty recognition before the run
  out was limited to that of a struggling middle order batsman who wasn t contributing
  enough runs but would save 20 odd runs in fielding. But that one picture changed
  his existence.Ask him today and Jhonty is still unsure if it was his leap against
  gravity or the click of the camera that made him the poster boy of World Cricket.2.
  Waqar Younis 4-62 at Sharjah Cup Final   The return of the wounded TigerWhat a match
  for fans, what a match for Pakistan and what a match for Waqar Younis it was. Being
  thrashed by Australia in the tour Down under, Wasim Akram was dethroned from Captaincy
  and Pakistan came to play the Sharjah Cup under a new leader, Moin Khan.Waqar was
  kept on the side lines by Wasim and it was his time to hit back. Although he had
  a rocking tournament, but the Burewala Express kept his best for the finals against
  the mighty South Africans. Defending a total of 263, Waqar s middle order burst
  kept a check on the Protease and gave Moin Khan his first tournament win as a captain.And
  not to forget from the same match was Inzaman s cracking off drive that nearly blew
  Nantie Haywards head.3. Afridi s Flying Kiss to Jacque Kallis   Kallis Chaumma DedeAs
  the old saying goes, you can expect anything from Shahid Afridi, but here was an
  act as bizarre as it can get. It was the Semifinal of the T-20 WC at Nottingham,
  Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat. The last ball of the 4th over, Afridi
  wacked a short one from Kallis over wide midwicket for four.It was one of the hundreds
  of boundaries Afridi struck in his career, but what he did next caught every one
  off guard and astonished Kallis. Out of the blue, Afridi blew him a kiss but Kallis
  wasn t thrilled. This was tempting food for TV channels who did not miss a chance
  to milk out ratings. The foot tapping Amitabh hit  Jumma Chaumma Dede  blended perfectly
  and also generated thousand of hits on YouTube.4. Abdul Razzaq s rampant century
  at Abu DhabiPakistan had lost the first match and badly needed a win to bounce back
  in the series. Same was the case with Razzaq who was ping ponged in and out of the
  team. Chasing a target of 286, Pakistan were bruised at 5-136 when Razzaq took guard.
  It was the perfect setting for Razzaq who grabbed the opportunity with both hands
  and showered a 72 ball 109 that included 10 sixes and 7 fours. In his own words,
  this was the most memorable and fighting innings he ever played.5.Fanie de Villiers
  Cycling joy and Hansie Cronje s Tanga jockey funWe have all seem them; we have all
  lived through them. Pakistan has seen much better days then the ones currently flashed
  to the world. Foreign teams used to visit Pakistan multiple times every year, they
  used to play hard and rubbishing aside the cultural shock syndrome, used to merge
  and enjoy the tastes of Pakistan s rich and colorful culture. Every time Pakistan
  play their home series in UAE, the images of Fanie de Villiers enjoying his cycle
  ride in Faisalabad s Famous  Ghanta Ghar Chowk , or the Late Hansie Cronje hacking
  the Tanga at Rawalpindi s  Raja Bazar , remind of the golden days of Pakistan Cricket.
  The smile of their faces tells the complete story, how secure and welcomed they
  felt in the land of pure.Only South Africa can fell Pakistan s pain, they themselves
  suffered international isolation for 27 years and went through the painful apartheid
  segregation. Only they can realize the agony behind empty stands and dusty grounds.
  They have helped us before, they could again stretch their hands and allow Pakistani
  fans to make some noise in those empty stands.                                                         '

  \ Carolina on Feb. 20 and for Democrats there on Feb. 27. Some of the most monumental\
  \ campaign battles in elections past have been fought in the state that holds the\
  \ first primary election of the American South.\nFor Trump, New Hampshire showed\
  \ he has staying power and can take a punch after losing on Feb. 1 to Texas Senator\
  \ Ted Cruz in the first contest, the Iowa caucuses. His win showed pundits were\
  \ wrong to think he would ultimately self-destruct based on his penchant for insults\
  \ and imprecise plans for the presidency.\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton, the former\
  \ U.S. secretary of state and former U.S. senator, now looks wounded, trailing Sanders\
  \ by 60 to 39 percent based on 86 percent of the returns.The wife of former President\
  \ Bill Clinton, Clinton barely won Iowa and now has been trounced in New Hampshire,\
  \ where young voters liked Sanders' populist proposals to break up big banks and\
  \ have the government pay for free college tuition.\n\u201CPeople have every right\
  \ to be angry but they\u2019re also hungry, they\u2019re hungry for solutions,\u201D\
  \ Clinton, 68, said after congratulating the 74-year-old Sanders. \"I will work\
  \ harder than anyone to actually make the changes that make your lives better.\"\
  \nClinton was headed to New York, home to her campaign headquarters, to regroup\
  \ with top aides and prepare for Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate. Her campaign\
  \ has denied reports it is considering a shakeup but acknowledged it would be natural\
  \ to add members to their team as the campaign progresses.\nSanders said his victory\
  \ showed \"we have sent the message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington,\
  \ from Maine to California, and that is that the government of our great country\
  \ belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\"\
  \nSome 73 percent of voters say they think the United States is on the wrong track,\
  \ and these disaffected people make up a majority of the support bases for Trump\
  \ and Sanders, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nThey are worried about the economy\
  \ and distrust establishment politicians they perceive as being part of the problem.\n\
  SHADOW-BOXING TRUMP\nTrump, 69, who has campaigned to deport illegal immigrants\
  \ and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States, was in first place\
  \ with 35 percent of the vote on the Republican side based on 88 percent of returns.\n\
  At his victory rally, Trump dispensed with niceties. He congratulated other candidates\
  \ in the race but promised to soon return to his pugnacious approach.\n\"Tomorrow:\
  \ boom, boom,\" he said, shadow boxing while his supporters cheered.\nThe New Hampshire\
  \ Republican race did little to clear up confusion about who would emerge as the\
  \ establishment contender to Trump on the Republican side.\nOhio's Republican governor,\
  \ John Kasich, won a spirited fight for second place in New Hampshire, with Cruz,\
  \ former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida fighting\
  \ for third place. All four were headed to South Carolina.\nBush, the son and brother\
  \ of former presidents, lived to fight another day, making something of a comeback\
  \ after a strong debate performance and solid weekend of campaigning.\n\u201CWhile\
  \ the reality TV star is doing well, it looks like you all have reset the race,\"\
  \ Bush told supporters. \"This campaign is not dead. We're going on to South Carolina.\"\
  \nRubio failed to dispatch Bush, seeing a drop in his support after a debate on\
  \ Saturday in which he drew criticism for repeating rehearsed lines from his stump\
  \ speech.\n\"I did not do well on Saturday night - listen to this: that will never\
  \ happen again,\" Rubio told supporters.\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who\
  \ called out Rubio for his robotic debate, fell behind the others in the voting\
  \ and canceled plans to go to South Carolina, a sign he could drop out soon.\nDISENCHANTED\
  \ VOTERS\nIndependent voters wield special clout in New Hampshire, second in the\
  \ series of state-by-state contests that lead to the parties' formal presidential\
  \ nominating conventions in July, because they can vote in either party's primary.\n\
  At a polling station in Manchester, Joan and Roland Martineau said they voted for\
  \ the two candidates they believed they could trust to shake things up.\nJoan, 68,\
  \ went for Sanders. \u201CI like this views, I like the way he speaks, I think I\
  \ can trust him,\u201D she said.\nRoland, 73, a registered Republican, went for\
  \ Trump, a man he said was \"more honest\" than other candidates. But he said he\
  \ would back Sanders over Trump in the general election in November.\nClinton had\
  \ for months been the front-runner nationally. But a Reuters/Ipsos poll done Feb\
  \ 2-5 showed Clinton and Sanders now in a dead heat.\nClinton campaign manager Robby\
  \ Mook said in a memo that the Democratic nomination would \"very likely\" be decided\
  \ in March, with the support of black and Hispanic voters key to victory. The next\
  \ primary races are in Nevada and South Carolina later this month.\n\"It will be\
  \ very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without\
  \ strong levels of support among African-American and Hispanic voters,\" Mook wrote."

text: "Facebook likely be the publisher of everything, says Prof Craig Duff\nThe News\
  \ International got an opportunity to have a Q & A with Prof Craig Duff - an award-winning\
  \ video journalist and television documentary director, producer and writer, specializing\
  \ in multi-platform storytelling and solo journalism.\nDuff was the director of\
  \ multimedia and chief video journalist for TIME, where he oversaw video and other\
  \ multimedia projects for the magazine\u2019s digital platforms and TIME.com.\n\
  He is the focal person on a US-funded project to establish a journalism school at\
  \ the IBA in partnership with Medill and the ICFJ.What prospects moved Medill to\
  \ partner with a Pakistani institution to establish a world class journalism institute?\
  \ How did you become part of it?\nDr. Lawrence Pintak, who is founding dean of \u201C\
  The Edward R. Murrow College of Communication\u201D at Washington State University\
  \ was based in Cairo some years ago running a centre very similar to what we\u2019\
  re building here called the \u201CKamal Adham Center for Journalism Training and\
  \ Research\u201D at The American University. Larry worked to sort out and gauge\
  \ the needs and interests of journalists and editors and media corporations here,\
  \ and what the issues are and what was needed for training under a US funded project\
  \ for establishing a journalism school. Then we bid on the project and were chosen\
  \ for the grant. So I knew that was happening and when the ICFJ wanted to bid on\
  \ it they needed to find a partner school so they called me because I knew everybody\
  \ basically in the whole chain. I had worked with Larry in Cairo at the Adham Centre,\
  \ and I got involved in this because I know the people who wrote the proposal for\
  \ the US government.\nWhat\u2019s the structure of CEJ-Medill partnership; can we\
  \ say that CEJ would be a replica of Medill?\nWe are really trying to create something\
  \ more permanent so our people won\u2019t be involved and we\u2019re going to help\
  \ train people who will carry it forward. So we\u2019re hoping that some people\
  \ will come through our programme in Chicago after that we\u2019ll train those folks\
  \ and they\u2019ll come and be the faculty.\nYou have conducted a successful training\
  \ session with local journalists; what\u2019s your observation?\nMy only experience\
  \ was the two-week \u201CBackpack/Mobile Multimedia Training\u201D course back in\
  \ October 2014 and I think this was the most rewarding international training experience\
  \ I\u2019ve ever had. Everyone who has come back from teaching here has had an extraordinary\
  \ experience and the key things they say are the eagerness among the people who\
  \ are attending to learn, to think differently about journalism. Our impact is only\
  \ measured by what happens once we leave if people apply what they\u2019ve learned\
  \ and started doing it. And it\u2019s great when you see that happening. The institute\
  \ is going to have the facility that will have a working studio and editing facilities\
  \ so they\u2019ll be able to train pretty much any technology here.\nWhat are the\
  \ dos and don\u2019ts for a journalist?\nIn television we don\u2019t set anything\
  \ up, you don\u2019t ask someone to repeat something so you can get a shot of it;\
  \ when you try to be in a place where things are happening and you get the shot\
  \ but you don\u2019t say \u2018could you fire that rifle again please so I can get\
  \ a better shot or I can get a better angle\u2019. We try not to stage things. But\
  \ that is pretty common in TV here.You have to be honest with your audience.\nHow\
  \ do you think electronic media has impacted the print media?\nNow, the newspaper\
  \ has to figure out ways to serve their readers what they\u2019ve already heard\
  \ the news on TV. They have to think of different ways of telling stories and giving\
  \ something else, something extra - an analysis or a context to the story.\nYou\
  \ arranged a student exchange program last year, how do you think such exchanges\
  \ are going to bring professionals closer?\nI think any time two people from two\
  \ cultures get together and work together you are going to have something interesting\
  \ happen and people will learn from each other. That\u2019s always good.\nIn today\u2019\
  s world, technology is changing the way we consume media; where are we heading?\n\
  Just look at the amount of change that has happened over your lifetime in terms\
  \ of how things were produced. It is extraordinary for me to think that I can shoot\
  \ something on mobile, edit it and bring it on my laptop. Pace of things happening\
  \ is so much faster in the past two years that who is to say that in five years\
  \ what we will be doing.\nRight now the big emphasis in news has really been about\
  \ this (mobile) device, not necessarily to record news but to play it or to view\
  \ it. And mobile is basically is how a lot of us in the west are getting our news\
  \ now \u2013 we are all getting hunched now sort of watching this thing all the\
  \ time. So social media is driving it, so that is a huge change in the past few\
  \ years as away from the web to mobile and now mobile is the big focus. Who is to\
  \ say what is going to happen next? It\u2019s probably going to be something portable\
  \ and something very easy for someone to see \u2013 but it has changed our habits\
  \ of how we consume news. I would say the web page homepage doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ anymore for the New York Times or Times magazine because no one goes there, Facebook\
  \ is the new homepage. Earlier, journalists acted as watchdog and decide what should\
  \ masses know but now with growing influence of reader\u2019s feedback we are witnessing\
  \ a reverse trend and journalists now focus on what people want to read\nIt\u2019\
  s sort of a double-edged sword because it is great to have feedback and you understand\
  \ where the viewers are reading by their comments. I think the watchdog role (of\
  \ media) is the very bedrock of journalism that we are there to serve a purpose\
  \ to keep those in power from doing crazy things or to at least make sure that there\
  \ is a check on power and it\u2019s a vital role.\nSocial media companies are taking\
  \ over the publisher\u2019s space and business too, how it\u2019s going to affect\
  \ media outlets?\nFacebook I think will like to be the publisher of everything and\
  \ be the only source of where people get stuff. So software companies are trying\
  \ to become the new publishers and they have a lot of power as they have the audience.\
  \ They\u2019ve already got partnerships with NY Times and National Geographic and\
  \ some others to publish directly. And we\u2019ll see where that goes. The thing\
  \ is that Facebook is only 12 years old who is to say in five years this is going\
  \ to be the biggest technology or software or whatever company surges ahead of them.\n\

text: 'Millions risk malnutrition as CO2 levels climb: study


  Paris: Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the air threaten to sap wheat, rice, and
  other staple grains of valuable nutrients, raising the spectre of mass malnutrition,
  researchers warned Monday.On current trends, higher CO2 concentrations could reduce
  iron, zinc and protein levels in the crops that feed the world by up to 17 percent
  by mid-century, they reported in the journal Nature Climate Change."Hundreds of
  millions of people could become newly deficient in these nutrients, primarily in
  Africa, Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East," lead author Matthew Smith, a
  researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told AFP."These are
  in addition to the billions of people already deficient that could see their condition
  worsen."Protein, along with the minerals iron and zinc, are essential nutrients
  for normal human growth and development.Zinc deficiency affects the immune system
  and makes children, particularly, more vulnerable to malaria, lung infections and
  deadly diarrhoeal diseases.A lack of iron increases the likelihood of mothers dying
  during childbirth, can lower IQ, and causes anaemia, or a drop in red blood cells.Wheat,
  rice and maize together account for roughly 40 percent of protein, zinc and iron
  supply in the diet worldwide.In general, humans get three-fifths of dietary protein,
  four-fifths of iron, and 70 percent of zinc requirements from plants.The global
  food system is also vulnerable to rising temperatures, prolonged drought, and other
  forms of extreme weather driven by climate change, earlier research has shown. Impacts
  include reduced crop yields, heat-stressed livestock, and shifts in the quantity
  and location of commercially-fished ocean species.- Unanticipated impacts -To assess
  how extra CO2 in the atmosphere might impact global health by 2050, Smith and colleague
  Samuel Myers ran models for 225 different food plants grown in 151 countries.If
  humanity continues emitting greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil, and natural
  gas at current levels, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is
  likely to reach 550 parts per million (ppm) by 2050.It is now at just over 400 ppm.The
  team found that nearly two percent of the global population -- an extra 175 million
  people -- could become zinc deficient, and 122 million would no longer get enough
  protein under those conditions.Some 1.4 billion women and children under five would
  probably find their iron intake reduced by four percent or more. Half-a-billion
  in this group risk developing iron deficiency-related disease.India would be hardest
  hit, with some 50 million people suffering a lack of zinc, and 38 million falling
  short of minimum protein requirements, said the team.The numbers of affected people
  would also go up dramatically in China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Kenya and
  other emerging or developing economies."Supplements could temporarily alleviate
  some of the health consequences, but they are not a viable long-term solution,"
  said Smith.Because they are difficult to distribute and do not address the underlying
  cause of malnutrition, vitamins and supplements "should best be seen as a short-term
  medical intervention," he added.More than two billion people worldwide are deficient
  in one or more nutrient, according the World Health Organization (WHO).'

  \ Following the US drone strike that killed Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mansour\

  \ $300 million aid to Pakistan.\nThe resolution requires the secretary of defense\
  \ to certify that Islamabad is taking demonstrative actions against the Haqqani\

text: "Sarfraz Merchant refuses to appear before FIA on March 15\nLONDON: Sarfraz\
  \ Merchant, one of the central characters in the MQM-related money-laundering investigation,\
  \ has told the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) investigators that he will be\
  \ unable to appear before it on March 15 to record his statement until the FIA does\
  \ not set its record straight and puts the whole context of the investigation right.\n\
  Merchant set the record straight by telling the FIA that he did not originally accuse\
  \ the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) or its leader Altaf Hussain of receiving money\
  \ from the RAW, India\u2019s main spy agency, but the Scotland Yard, showing proofs.\n\
  Sarfraz Merchant said he has undeniable proofs with him showing that the MQM took\
  \ money from the Indian sources and he indicated that he will cooperate with the\
  \ FIA once amends have been made to the summon, record set straight and inappropriate\
  \ language and threat of punishment withdrawn.\nSarfraz Merchant elaborated that\
  \ it was the Scotland Yard that originally said that the MQM took money from the\
  \ Indian government sources. He said it\u2019s a matter of record that the MQM leaders\
  \ including M Anwar and Tariq Mir accepted before the Scotland Yard investigators\
  \ that they received money from India for several years \u2013 in tune of millions\
  \ of Pounds.\nMerchant said that he came to know about the evidence of the MQM involvement\
  \ with the RAW during his recorded interview with the police in London when he saw\
  \ the shocking evidence when the police investigators revealed it to him. Merchant\
  \ said that he is aware -\_ and has proofs \u2013 that the MQM took money from RAW\
  \ but he was not alone in saying that but the Scotland Yard has said it in writing\
  \ too.\nMerchant said that his only issue is with the FIA letter \u201Cthe way it\
  \ has been presented and written\u201D. He said MQM\u2019s involvement with the\
  \ RAW is a serious matter and must be dealt at the highest level.\nThis correspondent\
  \ has obtained a copy of the hard-hitting letter written by Mr Sarfraz Merchant\
  \ in response to the hurriedly written summon issued by the Federal Investigation\
  \ Agency (FIA) to Sarfraz Merchant, urging him to appear before the committee mandated\
  \ to investigate the alleged links of the MQM with the RAW.\nThe FIA was forced\
  \ into action after Sarfraz Merchant said in a world exclusive with Geo News\u2019\
  \ flagship current affairs show \u2018Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath\u2019 that\
  \ he had been asked by the Scotland Yard investigators during recorded interviews\
  \ if he was aware that the MQM was in the pay of the Indian government sources.\n\
  Sarfraz Merchant said that he had not \u201Clevelled any allegation on any political\
  \ party or its leadership\u201D. He told the FIA that his interview on Geo News\
  \ was \u201Cin connection with a leaked document pertaining to a criminal inquiry\
  \ pending in the United Kingdom\u201D \u2013 i.e., money-laundering investigation\
  \ under the Proceeds of Crimes Act involving Altaf Hussain, M Anwar, Tariq Mir,\
  \ Sarfraz Merchant and two others.\n\u201CI had given my views on the contents of\
  \ that document and some observations of the concerned law enforcement agency of\
  \ UK Scotland Yard, which were brought to my notice being a party to the case during\
  \ my under caution interview on 15th of April,2015. It is therefore incorrect to\
  \ suggest that I have alleged something on a political party,\u201D stressed Sarfraz\
  \ Merchant, while explaining that it was not him but the Scotland Yard which believed\
  \ that the MQM received money from the Indian govt in violation of the UK as well\
  \ as Pakistani electoral laws.\nSarfraz Merchant told the FIA bosses that allegations\
  \ about MQM\u2019s links with RAW emerged first in June last year and he wondered\
  \ what took Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s government so long to come into action\
  \ when the nature of the allegations is of shocking and scandalous nature concerning\
  \ directly to the security of Pakistan. Merchant said that the \u201Csubject matter\
  \ of the criminal investigation in the UK is known to all and has been frequently\
  \ discussed in the media and there is no confusion that the issue is directly related\
  \ to the security of Pakistan\u201D.\nIssuing a hard-hitting critique of the very\
  \ poor handing of the case by the government of Pakistan, Merchant said in the letter:\
  \ \u201CI am surprised to learn that you have initiated action at such a belated\
  \ stage. It would have been proper to contact UK authorities more than a year ago\
  \ for mutual assistance and simultaneous initiation of proceedings in Pakistan;\
  \ unfortunately this was not done.\u201D\nSarfraz Merchant expressed his \u201C\
  disappointment on the language and text of your letter which appears to be an attempt\
  \ to intimidate and pressurize me by indicating criminal action against me and also\
  \ placing the entire onus of the case on my shoulders\u201D. Chaudhary Nisar Ali\
  \ Khan had requested Sarfraz Merchant to assist the FIA in its inquiry but the FIA\
  \ issued a threatening summon to Sarfraz Merchant.\nSarfraz Merchant took exception\
  \ to the fact that the FIA summon was signed off by the Commercial Banking Circle.\_\
  \ Merchant said he believed that \u201Cmatters of national security are required\
  \ to be handled more professionally and not as a typical case of Commercial Banking\
  \ Circle\u201D.\nSarfraz Merchant explained that he was a \u201Cresponsible and\
  \ patriotic citizen\u201D of Pakistan and he felt \u201Cobliged to render complete\
  \ assistance in a matter involving security and integrity of the country in accordance\
  \ with law, however the manner in which the case is being handled especially the\
  \ manner in which summon has been issued reflects that importance and gravity of\
  \ the issue has not been understood by your agency\u201D.\nSarfraz Merchant concluded:\
  \ \u201CUnder such circumstances I will not be able to appear on the 15th of March,\
  \ 2016 for giving my statement until the format/contents of your un-dated letter\
  \ delivered to me by DHL and through Pakistan High Commission, London through Post\
  \ received on 11/03/2016 and 12/03/2016 are corrected referred in Paragraph No 3\
  \ of this letter\u201D."

  \           KARACHI: As independent scientists, environmentalists and civil society\
  \ organizations continue their campaign to oppose Pakistan\u2019s decision to build\
  \ two more nuclear reactors in Karachi, scientists, engineers and management at\
  \ Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) insist that the country\u2019s move is the\
  \ most viable option to generate clean energy to overcome its lingering power crisis.Pakistan\
  \ is building two more nuclear reactors of 1100 megawatt each at Karachi coast in\
  \ collaboration with China to overcome crippling energy crisis. The twin plants\
  \ are scheduled to generate 2200 megawatt electricity within next five-six years.During\
  \ a visit to country\u2019s first nuclear facility, the KANUPP and site of K2 and\
  \ K3, reporters were briefed on the safety measures as well as its prospects as\
  \ viable and effective contributor to power generation.Afzar Minhaj, general manager\
  \ of KANNUP, said Pakistan has saved millions of dollars in oil export bills due\
  \ to power generations at country\u2019s nuclear reactors.A detailed presentation\
  \ during the briefing argued: \u201CThe nuclear energy is only affordable mature\
  \ option for clean energy. Karachi that too is faced with acute power shortage has\
  \ to contribute in energy generation rather to remain dependent. K-2 and K-3 projects\
  \ will provide clean energy, overcoming the power shortage and leaving minimum impact\
  \ on environment\u201D.To a question as to why the country can\u2019t rely on solar,\
  \ wind and hydro options for power generation, the authorities believed that Karachi\
  \ is not the best place to take advantage of these alternatives.\u201CYou need 500\
  \ acres land to establish a solar energy plant of 100 megawatt while K-2 and K-3\
  \ that will generate 2200 megawatt energy are being built on 585 acres. This space\
  \ is enough to set up more such plants,\u201D said Azfar Minhaj.\u201DHe said the\
  \ hydro power generation, though environment friendly, has certain issues as well\
  \ and so is the case with solar power.Discussing public perception on nuclear disasters,\
  \ he said concerns about radiation related emergencies in power plants originally\
  \ emanate from World War II nuclear attacks on Japan.Citing different reports from\
  \ international organizations on nuclear accidents, he said more deaths were caused\
  \ by evacuation than radioactivity in Japan\u2019s Fukushima disaster that was caused\
  \ by a tsunami in 2011. \u201CNot a single death was caused due to radioactivity\
  \ in Three Miles Island fiasco despite core meltdown while 28 deaths were caused\
  \ by Chernobyl accident due to radioactivity.\u201D\u201CWe have built our plants\
  \ 12 meter above sea level after conducting a seismic survey based on past Tsunami\
  \ that hit Karachi cost in 1945. The solid structure and strict safety measures\
  \ at KNUPP completely rule out the doomsday scenario where power plants are destroyed\
  \ but Karachi survives.\u201DA senior official said mock evacuations and other such\
  \ exercises were also undertaken in adjacent areas as part of a contingency plan\
  \ to cope up with emergencies. Apart from that, he said 10 detectors have also been\
  \ installed in 10 different areas of the city that gauge the radioactivity. Some\
  \ areas including Sadder, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Orangi Town, Federal B Area, North Karachi,\
  \ Drig Colony, KANUPP Colony, Abdul Rehman Goth and Faqeer Muhammad Goth were also\
  \ under KANNUP surveillance.The KANNUP has also setup a Desalination Demonstration\
  \ Plant in its premises that has been catering its needs for drinking and other\
  \ purposes since 2010. A senior official said the plant at KANNUP is producing 400,000\
  \ gallons water per day that not only meets its own needs, but \u201Cwe are also\
  \ supplying it to nearby villages through tankers\u201D.The KANNUP is also making\
  \ efforts to address health issues of the people living in nearby villages through\
  \ sending mobile nursing units. \u201CWe have frequently arranged gatherings with\
  \ elders of nearby Goths to resolve their issues that they share with us,\u201D\
  \ he said.All in all, with more and more countries embarking on plans to lay their\
  \ hands on civil nuclear technology, it seems Islamabad too is not ready to miss\
  \ out on its socioeconomic development. It appears determined to go ahead with its\
  \ civil nuclear program to overcome power crisis that has crippled the country\u2019\
  s economy."

text: "Cancer on the rise among children in underprivileged areas of Pakistan\nKarachi:\
  \ An increasing number of cancer cases are being reported among children from low-income\
  \ localities of Pakistan, as per a study conducted by paediatric oncologists at\
  \ the National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Karachi, which cites adverse environmental\
  \ conditions, unhygienic living conditions, consumption of unsafe drinking water\
  \ and malnourishment as possible causes.\_\n\u201CPoor quality of life due to deteriorating\
  \ environmental conditions and unhygienic lifestyle is causing frequent infections\
  \ to a vast majority of Pakistani children. Combined with the malnourishment, these\
  \ infections are resulting in causing various types of cancers to children,\u201D\
  \ said Professor Nizam-ul-Hassan, former director NICH and president of the Child\
  \ Aid Foundation (CAA), a non-profit organisation which runs the cancer treatment\
  \ at the NICH with doctors and philanthropists.\nTalking to The News, he said there\
  \ was no public sector cancer treatment facility in Karachi or even in the entire\
  \ Sindh and Balochistan, and the whole burden of cancer treatment was borne by NGOs\
  \ and associations like the CAA, the Children Cancer Hospital and some other private\
  \ hospitals, including the Aga Khan University Hospital.\nAccording to him, a group\
  \ of Pakistani doctors, including NICH former director Prof Nizamul Hasan, started\
  \ the cancer treatment at the Children Hospital Karachi in April 1999 and since\
  \ then thousands of cancer patients have completely been cured by the qualified\
  \ and trained oncologists and paramedics.\n\u201CAround 50 to 60 children suffering\
  \ from cancers are brought at our OPD everyday, of which 50 percent are new patients.\
  \ Around 300 patients are receiving chemotherapy with various types of cancers,\
  \ including Retinoblastomas, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemias and Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas\u201D\
  , he claimed, adding that the inpatient capacity of the facility was just 14 patients\
  \ due to space constraints.\nWhile quoting pediatric oncologists, he said the worst\
  \ environmental and hygienic conditions at low-income group localities in Pakistan\
  \ were some of the major reasons behind frequent infections, including diarrhea\
  \ and gastroenteritis among children, which was the leading cause of solid tumors\
  \ or blood cancers to them.\nProf Nizam said although the study had yet to be published\
  \ but the observations of the pediatric oncologists led to similar direction, saying\
  \ childhood cancer was on the rise among children of low-income group people, who\
  \ used to live in areas with extremely poor environmental and hygienic conditions,\
  \ having no or low vaccination status and suffered infections on multiple occasions\
  \ in a short span of time.\nTo a query, he said the centre had a team of pediatric\
  \ oncologists, led by Dr Uzma Imam and paramedical staff, who had been trained by\
  \ German pediatric oncologists and paramedics in 2005-06, adding that renowned Pakistani\
  \ pediatric oncologists practicing in US and UK often visit their centre and offered\
  \ their assistance and advice in treatment of patients.\n\u2018Malnourished patients\u2019\
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\n\u201CDuring the last several years, almost 40 percent children brought\
  \ to the NICH with various types of cancers were malnourished and due to low immunity,\
  \ their chances of having cancer increased\u201D, Prof Nizam further said.\nIn addition\
  \ to fighting cancer, he said, doctors and paramedics had to take care of the nutritional\
  \ status of the patients so that their bodies could fight the lethal disease like\
  \ cancers.\nHe further said malnourishment was on the rise among children of low-income\
  \ segments and it was resulting in spreading cancer and other lethal infections.\n\
  \u201CA group of German doctors and nurses, who trained our staff, emphasised on\
  \ improving nutritional status of children with cancers, since a child could not\
  \ fight cancer without having enough nutrition.\u201D\nThe professor said the centre\
  \ was providing highly enriched food supplements in addition to milk and dates to\
  \ cancer patients as most of the patients suffering from cancers were highly fragile\
  \ and underweight due to malnourishment.\n\u2018Eye cancers on the rise\u2019\n\
  Eye cancers, also known as retinoblastomas, are on the rise among Pakistani children\
  \ being brought from rural parts of Sindh, Balochistan and lower Punjab, according\
  \ to Prof Nizam claimed.\nHe said doctors were trying to understand the sudden rise\
  \ in eye cancers which render the patient blind at an early age if not treated at\
  \ the early stages.\nHe said the most common causes of the eye cancers were due\
  \ to genetic reasons, but because of\_ sudden increase in the number of children\
  \ with retinoblastomas, experts at the cancer treatment facility were worried and\
  \ trying to understand the phenomenon.\n\u2018Short of space at centre\u2019\nDespite\
  \ spending Rs600 million annually, the cancer treatment facility at the NICH caters\
  \ to only a few thousand patients annually as only 300 can be given chemotherapy,\
  \ while only 14 can be admitted at the center at a time, according to Prof Nizam\
  \ said.\n\u201CWe are facing a shortage of space due to growing number of patients\
  \ being brought to them from across the country.\n\u201CWe are ready to generate\
  \ double the amount we are spending currently on treatment of children if we are\
  \ provided with ample space to admit more patients. A building at the NICH back\
  \ was supposed to be given to us after its completion, but even after passage of\
  \ a decade, it has not yet been constructed, even after the devolution process\u201D\
  , he said.\nHe urged the provincial government to release funds for the construction\
  \ of the building at the NICH so that more patients with cancers could be treated."

  \ was made on Friday as son of Pakistani bus driver and Labour parliamentarian Sadiq\
  \ Khan defied all odds and won the race for London mayor, beating the government-supported\
  \ multi-billionaire Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith.\nSadiq Khan defeated Zac by 44\
  \ to 35 percent in the first preference votes and easily managed to win in the second\
  \ preferance.\nSpeaking after the official announcement of his victory, Khan said\
  \ he wanted a \u201Cmore equal London.\u201D\n\u201CI am so proud that Londoners\
  \ have today chosen hope over fear and unity over division,\u201D he added.\nThe\
  \ defeat of Zac Goldsmith at the hands of British Pakistani politician Sadiq Khan\
  \ is a huge personal setback for the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) chairman Imran\
  \ Khan who openly endorsed Zac Goldsmith and campaigned for his former brother-in-law\
  \ \u2013 Jemima Goldsmith\u2019s younger brother.\nIn an interview with Hamid Hamid\
  \ on Geo News, Imran Khan said that he was proud to support Zac Goldsmith because\
  \ he originally urged him to enter politics. The PTI leader then expressed his support\
  \ for Zac Goldsmith on 23rd of March on Twitter. Imran Khan told his followers:\
  \ \u201CZac Goldsmith is running for Mayor of London. Have known him for 20 years.\
  \ He is an honourable man with strong convictions and compassion. Zac is a man of\
  \ integrity with a commitment to justice. He has the leadership capabilities to\
  \ make a great mayor.\u201D\nImran Khan supported Zac Goldsmith because Zac has\
  \ always praised Imran Khan and told Geo News in an interview that \u201CImran Khan\
  \ is the answer to Pakistan\u2019s problem\u201D. He said that he considered himself\
  \ \u201Chalf Pakistani\u201D but then he went on to run a nasty campaign associating\
  \ Muslims with terrorism and incorrectly calling Sadiq Khan an extremist, radical\
  \ and terror sympathiser.\nWhen asked by this correspondent about Imran Khan\u2019\
  s support for Zac Goldsmith, Sadiq Khan, while laughing, said that \u201Cit\u2019\
  s a blessing that Imran Khan doesn\u2019t have a vote in London\u201D. Sadiq Khan\
  \ said that extremely negative campaign was run against him by Zac Goldsmith and\
  \ the Tory government but he said that he has always believed in \u201Chope against\
  \ fear and division\u201D. He said that\nZac attacked Sadiq Khan using race and\
  \ religion card to such an extent that his own party\u2019s former cabinet minister\
  \ and party chair Sayeeda Warsi said that Zac Goldsmith had become unrecognisable\
  \ to her and that his campaign team was \u201Cdestroying\u201D him through attacks\
  \ on Muslims.\nSadiq Khan told this scribe that he will be a mayor of all lonoders\
  \ and will serve diligently. he said that he will use his tenure to try to improve\
  \ trade relations between pakistan and the UK.\nMillions of Pounds were spent by\
  \ the Tory campaign on telling voters that Sadiq Khan was a Pakistani, Muslim, terror\
  \ sympathiser and hence he should not be trusted.\nZac Goldsmith was supported by\
  \ Prime Minister David Cameron as the duo joined forced and used every trick in\
  \ the book to defame Sadiq Khan to scare off voters, including attacks on Sadiq\
  \ Khan during live transmission on the state television.\nDavid Cameron at the prime\
  \ minister\u2019s questions time by saying Labour\u2019s mayoral candidate Tooting\
  \ MP Sadiq Khan had appeared on platforms with a London imam who \u201Csupports\
  \ IS\u201D (Islamic State).\nThis was despite the imam in question, Suliman Gani,\
  \ having already said on Twitter that he had attended a political event with Conservative\
  \ candidate Zac Goldsmith and had supported the local Tory challenger to Khan at\
  \ the general election.\nIt turned out that Gani had appeared with Zac Goldsmith\
  \ on many occasions and the two were pictured together. Gani said that he backed\
  \ the party\u2019s candidate Dan Watkins last May and even supplied canvassers for\
  \ his campaign. He added that, following the election, the Tories had asked him\
  \ to help them find potential local councillors. He said he felt he had been used\
  \ by the Conservatives \u201Cas a scapegoat to discredit Sadiq Khan.\u201D\nZac\
  \ Goldsmith\u2019s campaign in English areas told voters that Sadiq Khan was a Muslim\
  \ and he must not be given votes; In Indian community areas, Zac\u2019s campaign\
  \ team said that Sadiq was of Pakistani heritage, that he was a Muslim and didn\u2019\
  t support Narendra Modi when he last visited London, they also circulated a picture\
  \ of Zac with Modi and Pm Cameron, they also told Indians that their jewellery will\
  \ not be safe if Sadiq Khan wins; In Jewish areas similar campaign of fear and division\
  \ was run.\nAndrew Boff, Tory leader in the Greater London Assembly and Zac\u2019\
  s colleague, blasted Zac Goldsmith for doing \"real damage\" to community relations.\
  \ He said Zac Goldsmith has \"blown up bridges\" by linking Labour's Sadiq Khan\
  \ with Muslim \"extremists\".\nAndrew Boff said it was an error to \"equate people\
  \ of conservative religious views with sympathising with terrorism\".He said:\_\
  \ Mr Boff, the former Conservative group leader on the London Assembly, told the\
  \ BBC: \"I mentioned that I thought this was a mistake for future integration in\
  \ London. I don't think it was dog whistle because you can't hear a dog whistle\
  \ - everybody could hear this.\nIt was effectively saying that people of conservative\
  \ religious views are not to be trusted and you shouldn't share a platform with\
  \ them. That's outrageous.\"\nSadiq Khan has previously said he had \"never hidden\"\
  \ the fact that, as a former chairman of Liberty and a human rights lawyer, he had\
  \ acted for \"some pretty unsavoury characters\".\nMr Boff said the party had actively\
  \ engaged with the Muslim community in Newham, but \"now those bridges that have\
  \ been built, a few of them have been blown up by this campaign\"."

  \ Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said that former cricket star and PTI Chairman\
  \ Imran Khan should explain why he openly supported Zac Goldsmith during the recent\
  \ bitter London mayoral election campaign, which saw the former winning the biggest\
  \ ever personal mandate in British political history.\nIn his first exclusive interview\
  \ to any Pakistani and South Asian media outlet on Thursday, Sadiq Khan told Geo\
  \ News that Imran Khan\u2019s open endorsement for Zac Goldsmith came as a surprise\
  \ to him.\nThe London mayor said: \u201CImran Khan should explain why he supported\
  \ Zac Goldsmith. When I was little, Imran Khan was my hero. He used to be one of\
  \ the best all-rounders \u2013 1982 and 1987 series were very good, then the world\
  \ cup in 1992. It is sad [that he supported Zac] but this is for IK to answer and\
  \ not me.\u201D\nSadiq Khan, the Labour victor and former cabinet minister under\
  \ Tony Blair, outstripped Boris Johnson's 2008 record to win a landslide 1,310,143\
  \ votes in his race to be Mayor of London, beating his Tory rival Zac Goldsmith\
  \ by nearly half a million votes.\nThe toxic election campaign saw Zac Goldsmith\
  \ branding Sadiq Khan an \u2018extremist, terrorist sympathiser, unsafe, closet\
  \ radical and a threat to Britain\u2019s national security.\u2019 Zac Goldsmith\u2019\
  s attack on sadiq Khan was so racist and Islamophobic that former Tory cabinet minister\
  \ and party leader Sayeeda Warsi openly condemned Zac Goldsmith.\nSadiq Khan told\
  \ this scribe that it was unfortunate that Zac Goldsmith failed on all policies\
  \ and tried to scare off voters by telling that Sadiq Khan is of Pakistani origin\
  \ and Muslim therefore he shouldn\u2019t be trusted.\nSadiq Khan said that he has\
  \ multiple identities and he\u2019s proud of all his identities including his Pakistani\
  \ origin and Muslim faith.\n\u201CCurrently, Pakistan's reputation is not so good.\
  \ My opponents said to people that I come from Pakistan, that I'm a Muslim. The\
  \ interesting thing is that I admitted all this myself: Yes! I am from Pakistan.\
  \ Yes! I'm a Muslim \u2013 but I have policies, values ideas to be the best mayor.\
  \ And I'll be a mayor for all of London, whether the people are Muslims, Christians,\
  \ Jews, Sikhs or Hindus, Buddhists or atheists, I'll still be your mayor.\u201D\n\
  Sadiq Khan accepted that the fight for the second most important job in Britain\
  \ was very tough. He said that his parents taught him how to fight for values and\
  \ be strong in face of odds. He said he couldn\u2019t be where he is today if it\
  \ was not for the values instilled in him by his parents.\n\u201CMy background and\
  \ my values come from my parents. They originate from Pakistan and they're a source\
  \ of pride for me. I always source back to my religion, Islam. If you can help others,\
  \ you can. Don\u2019t be arrogant, don\u2019t be vain. If you get an opportunity,\
  \ then explain to people what type of a country Pakistan is, and what type of a\
  \ religion Islam is. This was my thinking. I am proud of who I am and I have every\
  \ reason to take pride in my being and my values.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that he\
  \ was supported by people of all faiths and people of no faith. \u201CMy victory\
  \ is everyone's victory. The support I received in the shape of campaigning, finance\
  \ and prayers was absolutely fantastic. And we showed the world that London is the\
  \ best city in the world,\u201D he added.\nSadiq Khan told Geo News that he was\
  \ aware that his victory was celebrated across Pakistan and people prayed for his\
  \ victory and held celebrations when he was declared a victor.\n\u201CI received\
  \ messages from friends and supporters about the pride that was felt in Pakistan.\
  \ My parents, grandparents are from Pakistan, my family is still there so I feel\
  \ proud, I feel humbled, and this is a responsibility to show London that a man\
  \ from an Islamic background and Pakistani heritage can help business, can build\
  \ the homes, can fix the transport.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that Tory election campaign\
  \ was negative and counter-productive and it was clear that the Lonodoners rejected\
  \ their message of division and hatred.\n\u201CThe Conservative campaign was extremely\
  \ negative, divisive and desperate. People were doubted about whether it is possible\
  \ for London to choose a mayor and have security around other issues. The support\
  \ we received was fantastic. The biggest ever turnout in election, the biggest vote\
  \ to the winning candidate and we've shown the world that we're the best city in\
  \ the world. And I thank all your viewers (of Geo News) for the best wishes after\
  \ elections. I received lots of messages after May 5. I am deeply thankful to all\
  \ those people. I am very busy at the moment and I can\u2019t thank everyone in\
  \ person but I know their sentiments and value them.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that\
  \ it was a sad fact that the \u201Creputation of our religion Islam is not good\
  \ these days\u201D. He said many people in the world think that all Muslims are\
  \ terrorists and extremists. \u201CSo if we can show them that we're peaceful, law-abiding\
  \ and that we're capable of keeping everyone safe, then the reputation of Islam\
  \ will improve.\u201D\nKhan has said he is not a Muslim leader, not a spokesperson\
  \ of Islam and not the representative of Muslims but he had made it clear that he\u2019\
  s a practicing Muslim and observes Ramazan.\nHe told Geo News that fasting for 19\
  \ hours a day in the UK is not an easy task especially when there\u2019s a round\
  \ the clock job to do at the City Hall but he said that Islam is all about making\
  \ sacrifices and overcoming the self, for others.\n\u201CIt is difficult to fast\
  \ for 19 hours. I engage in a lot of speeches, media, TV and public debating. Fasting\
  \ is a sacrifice and this is a month of charity. And this is my humility. I know\
  \ a lot of people in London are hungry. 100,000 people last year used a food bank.\
  \ So fasting allows me to have solidarity with these hungry, poor people.\n\u201C\
  There is a reason fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. If you're a Muslim,\
  \ and you can fast, then that's great. Another positive thing is that non-Muslims\
  \ are now learning about Islam, about fasting. They ask me \u201Chow are you doing\
  \ this? How is the fasting going?\" I think this is a good thing that they're beginning\
  \ to understand our religion.\u201D\n\u2018Ignorant Trump needs to understand Islam\u2019\
  \nSadiq Khan condemned US politician Donald Trump for helping extremist groups such\
  \ as Daesh by announcing a ban on all Muslims from entering the United States.\n\
  \u201CExtremists say that western values and Islam is incompatible \u2013 that you\
  \ cannot be a Muslim if you're western. They're both different. Donald Trump is\
  \ saying the same: that you cannot be western if you're a Muslim. He proposed a\
  \ ban on Muslims from entering USA. After my victory, he announced that he'd make\
  \ an exception for Sadiq Khan.\n\u201CMy answer is this: I am not an exception.\
  \ Why are you making an exception for me? There are law-abiding Muslims in England\
  \ and London and Europe and all around the world who want to go America. They're\
  \ peaceful, they're law-abiding. Donald trump is basically doing ISIS' work for\
  \ them by preaching their message of either Westernism or Islam.\u201D\nThe London\
  \ mayor said that Donald Trump was an ignorant man who needed to broaden his horizons\
  \ and understanding of Islam.\n\u201CI say that Trump is an idiot. He doesn\u2019\
  t understand Islam, and it is our duty to make him understand that this is not what\
  \ Muslims or Islam is about. And in America there are Americans who are Muslims\
  \ working and living peacefully.\u201D\nSadiq Khan outlined his plan of dealing\
  \ with extremism by supporting the police and security agencies in effectively tacking\
  \ with this menace and by rooting out hate preaching. He said that the biggest worry\
  \ was that it needed only one terrorist to succeed in his mission of causing mayhem\
  \ and terror. He said the fact that many young Muslims, including many women, went\
  \ to Syria from the UK to join ISIS, was a worry and must be dealt with.\n\u201C\
  It is a big worry. London is a great city. Intervention has to be more resilient\
  \ to this preaching of hate. There is a motive to close down those websites that\
  \ are encouraging people to go astray. There have been moves to closing down certain\
  \ accounts and stopping things which encourage people to join terror groups. So\
  \ we have a responsibility to ensure that young people aren't led down that path.\u201D\
  \nSadiq Khan last week appeared with Prime Minister David Cameron to show support\
  \ for the \u201CIn\u201D campaign which wants UK to stay in the European Union.\
  \ Only weeks ago the PM had called Sadiq Khan an extremist in the parliament. Observes\
  \ said that it was Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory and his vindication that the British\
  \ premier stood next to him and praised him and his election mandate.\nSadiq Khan\
  \ said he believed that it was in Britain\u2019s interest to stay in the European\
  \ Union and not leave it.\n\u201CWe showed on May 5 how hope and fairness can be\
  \ used to defeat division. Jobs, export market, high street, restaurants, fashion...\
  \ market of USA, China, Japan. We need to think of consequences and remind people\
  \ of the downsides. The benefits are huge.\u201D\n\_"

  \ and producers to showcase their products in order to gain access to China's market.The\
  \ expo is also an opening for countries participating in the Belt and Road (B&R)\
  \ initiative to boost their infrastructure upgrading and reach wider markets.Pakistan\
  \ is one such country, which is undergoing massive infrastructure development to\
  \ align itself with global transportation and communication networks.The China-Pakistan\
  \ Economic Corridor (CPEC) will create an advanced network of roads, railways and\
  \ a deep-sea port that will boost trade with China, Central Asia and Europe.China\u2019\
  s demand for imported food has been growing steadily, creating a market worth $58.28\
  \ billion last year, a 25 percent increase year-on-year.Pakistan, on the other hand,\
  \ has a largely agrarian economy.With the help of Chinese scientists, local agriculture\
  \ specialists have successfully introduced modern farming techniques.Hybrid rice\
  \ and hybrid wheat have been the most successful products, seeing a marked increase\
  \ in yield.Meanwhile, Pakistani mangoes are also doing well; 10,000 tons of them\
  \ are expected to be exported to China by the end of this year.To take advantage\
  \ of China''s food market, Pakistani producers at the CIIE can offer their own unique\
  \ and cost-effective products.A bigger share of the market in China would translate\
  \ into higher revenues, improved quality and a wider product range.Apart from food,\
  \ there are other Pakistani products with immense potential for export to China,\
  \ including onyx stones, minerals and surgical items.The expo organizers were initially\
  \ expecting around 150,000 purchasing agents, but they have so far registered over\
  \ 160,000. This massive participation will present Pakistan with access to markets\
  \ in other countries as well.As foreign buyers experience the previously unexplored\
  \ Pakistani prospects, new windows of trade will open.Thus, Pakistani businesses\
  \ will expand not just into China, but also internationally.Starting from the port\
  \ of Shanghai, China is rolling out assistance for B&R countries to bring down their\
  \ trade costs.The cargo clearance process has been simplified and a new filing mechanism\
  \ is being built for the CIIE pavilions of these countries.China is also adjusting\
  \ tariffs on certain products, such as nuts from Pakistan, in order to meet the\
  \ demand among domestic consumers.As a follow-up step to the import expo, Pakistani\
  \ manufacturers can take advantage of China's booming e-commerce sector.They can\
  \ utilize this highly developed industry to reach out to more customers than would\
  \ be possible only with physical stores in China.Alibaba Group has acquired Pakistan's\
  \ largest e-commerce portal and its payment arm Alipay is planning to enter the\
  \ Pakistani market this year.These ventures will help local manufacturers export\
  \ goods to China while letting the supply chain infrastructure, which is already\
  \ maturing under the CPEC and B&R initiative, do its job.Pakistan and China are\
  \ developing stronger ties in the rapidly evolving global order."

  \ help Khyber Pakhtunkhwa demolish Punjab by 151 runs in the final of Pakistan Cup\
  \ 2016 at Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad, on Sunday.\nIn the day-night decider, Fakhar\
  \ (115) and Ahmed Shehzad (62) gave a rapid start to enable KP to pile up 311-9\
  \ in the allotted 50 overs.\nSpinners Yasir Shah (3-26) and Zohaib Khan (3-23) then\
  \ bowled superbly to dismiss Punjab for 160 in 36.1 overs.\nKP had also lifted the\
  \ Pentangular Cup in January 2015 when they defeated Balochistan by six wickets\
  \ in the final under the captaincy of Junaid Khan in Karachi.\nThe Pakistan Cricket\
  \ Board (PCB) this season named this event as Pakistan Cup by making some changes.\n\
  Younis Khan won a vital toss and quite rightly elected to bat first on a pitch that\
  \ was full of runs.\nIn-form openers Shehzad (62) and Fakhar (115) provided an opening\
  \ stand of 118 in 15.4 overs.\nLeft-arm spinner Kashif Bhatti finally broke the\
  \ partnership when he had Shehzad stumped by Mohammad Rizwan. The decision was given\
  \ through a referral.\nShehzad, who seemed in elegant touch, smacked two sixes and\
  \ seven fours in his fiery 45-ball knock.\nShehzad finished the event as the highest\
  \ scorer with 372 runs, including three fifties and a superb 143.\nYounis promoted\
  \ left-handed all-rounder Zohaib Khan (12) in the batting order but he departed\
  \ early. Shoaib Malik had Zohaib caught at deep square-leg by Amad Butt when he\
  \ attempted a slog sweep.\nZohaib, who struggled against Malik, faced 27 deliveries.\n\
  Fakhar was held at short mid-on by substitute Asif Ali off Test pacer Ehsan Adil\
  \ after the Mardan-born player had cracked the fourth century of his career.\nFakhar\
  \ hit Shoaib for a four towards mid-off to complete his hundred. He struck three\
  \ huge sixes and 12 fours in his 111-ball feat. He ended the event as the second\
  \ highest scorer with 297 runs, which included one century and two fifties.\nFakhar\
  \ added 52 with Younis (49) for the third wicket.\nYounis and Fahim Ashraf (31)\
  \ added 57 for the fourth wicket before Ehsan dismissed the latter to leave KP at\
  \ 265-4 in 44 overs.\nFahim struck three fours and a six from 37 balls. Musadiq\
  \ Ahmed (19) used long handle, hitting two fours and one six in his rapid ten-ball\
  \ knock.\nYounis smacked one six from 59 balls before being caught by Shan Masood\
  \ off Amad as KP lost four wickets off the last 13 balls.\nYoung all-rounder Amad\
  \ was the pick of the bowlers with 3-55 in ten overs. Ehsan and Aamer Yamin remained\
  \ expensive with figures of 2-75 in ten overs and 1-49 in six, respectively.\nPunjab\
  \ had a poor start when left-arm pacer Zia-ul-Haq removed Salman Butt (0) and Aamer\
  \ (1) in quick succession to leave them at 29-2 in 7.2 overs.\nAsad Shafiq (16)\
  \ also fell early, held excellently by Fakhar at short-cover off the bowling of\
  \ Fahim. Asad struck three fours from 15 balls.\nLeft-arm spinner Mohammad Asghar\
  \ got the prized scalp of Shan Masood (36). Asghar tossed it up, it swung in sharply,\
  \ Shan went on back-foot to cut it, missed it completely before it crashed the stumps.\
  \ Shan hit five fours from 40 balls. Punjab were gasping at 55-4 in the 13th over.\n\
  Shoaib (24) and Rizwan (22) tried to consolidate the innings, but at 97, Test-leggie\
  \ Yasir Shah had the Punjab captain caught by Fahim in the deep. Malik smashed one\
  \ six and two fours from 26 deliveries.\nLeft-arm spinner Zohaib dislodged Rizwan\
  \ and Amad (0) in his first over to leave Punjab tottering at 107-7 in the 23rd\
  \ over.\nFahim took his third catch when he held Rizwan at point after the international\
  \ stumper had smacked two fours from 33 balls. Yasir removed Saif Badar (10).\n\
  Zulfiqar Babar (29) and Kashif Bhatti (15) extended KP\u2019s wait for celebration\
  \ as they added 36 for the ninth wicket before Zohaib sent back the former, trapped\
  \ lbw.\nZulfiqar struck two sixes and one four from 32 balls. Yasir completed the\
  \ rout when he had Ehsan (5) to fold Punjab.\nZia-ul-Haq got 2-25 in eight overs.\n\
  The winners KP received Rs2 million and a glittering trophy, while the runners-up\
  \ received Rs1 million and runners-up trophy.\nBesides, Rs100,000 each was handed\

  \ Fakhar Zaman, best batsman Ahmed Shehzad (372 runs), best bowlers Mohammad Amir\

  \  Islamabad Justice Athar Minallah of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) here Wednesday\
  \ issued notices to the respondents after a petitioner challenged the increase in\
  \ unaccounted for gas (UFG) benchmark from 4.5 to 9 per cent that as per petitioner\
  \ will cause huge loss to the public of Pakistan. The petitioner, Farrukh Dall advocate\
  \ has cited federation of Pakistan through secretary cabinet division, ministry\
  \ of  petroleum  and natural  resources, ministry of finance and oil & gas regulatory\
  \ authority (OGRA) as respondents. IHC bench issuing notices to the above said respondents\
  \ also issued notices to the attorney general of Pakistan seeking comments within\
  \ fortnight. The petitioner said that the Constitution of Pakistan is not silent\
  \ on issues which affect economic life of the nation and its citizens. The Constitution\
  \ contains a whole range of articles 3, 4 and 5(2) 9, 14, 18, 23 and 24 which have\
  \ a direct nexus with good economic governance and fundamental rights.   \u201C\
  That the UFG benchmark of 4.5% was fixed by Ogra for Sui Northern Gas Pipelines\
  \ Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) for fiscal year 2011-12 to\
  \ 2014-15 whereas through an illegal decision petroleum ministry and Ogra are trying\
  \ to increase UFG benchmark from 4.5 per cent to 9 per cent on the pretext of non-consumers\
  \ \u2018gas theft, law and order situation and bulk/retail ratio which is illegal/unlawful\
  \ act on their part. This is being done by them despite Prime Minister's deferment\
  \ for change in the gas pricing mechanism that is estimated to increase consumers\
  \ tariff significantly,\u201D he said. The combined impact to the consumers would\
  \ be Rs65-70 billion if the decision is implemented. In fact 4.5 per cent UFG benchmark\
  \ fixed by Ogra in the consumer tariff was meant to reasonably cover the cost of\
  \ pilferage, leakage, loss in security situation and all other difficulties. The\
  \ petitioner argued that petroleum ministry and ECC was not legally empowered to\
  \ issue policy guidelines on UFG and provision of doubt debts in the first place\
  \ as it is a direct jurisdiction of Ogra, which it has been exercising since its\
  \ inception in 2002. The government and regulator are obligated to launch the campaign\
  \ against gas theft rather passing the theft of gas to the consumers. The petitioner\
  \ said that the Supreme Court of Pakistan through a November 25, 2011 judgment had\
  \ shown serious concern  on high  UFG of 11 per cent on SNGPL system and 9.5 per\
  \ cent on SSGCL system and  also referred the matter of increasing UFG benchmark\
  \ from 5 per cent to 7 per cent  for year 2009-2010 to NAB for investigation. The\
  \ petitioner further argued that rectification of gas leakages is the core responsibility\
  \ of the company to which any negligence is not entertainable as gas leakages are\
  \ clearly as controllable factor. Theft of gas has contributed towards increase\
  \ of UFG but the same should have been curtailed after the promulgation of Criminal\
  \ Amendment Act, 2011.  The petitioner has prayed to the IHC to declare the increase\
  \ in UFG illegal and unlawful."

  \ slow pace of work being carried out  on Metro Bus Service Project , however, the\
  \ chairman of its implementation subcommittee , Hanif Abbasi vows confidently that\
  \ it would be completed on January 30, 2015. However, he also clarified that Peshawar\

  \ operate immediately on the routes of Islamabad and Rawalpindi after the inauguration\
  \ of the project on January 30, 2015 and all the speculations being aired about\
  \ its delay by people would prove wrong. Elaborating the reasons for delay in completion\
  \ of work on Peshawar Morr Terminal, Hanif Abbasi said that over 9 flyovers, 4 under\
  \ passes and 4 ramps have to be constructed on terminal plan. Moreover, the volume\
  \ of work of MBP of Rawalpindi and Islamabad is 40 per cent more than compared to\
  \ Lahore MBP. On the directions of the Punjab chief minister, work on the project\
  \ has been further expedited for meeting the new deadline. On the other hand, people\
  \ including labourers carrying out work on the project, claimed that there is no\
  \ possibility that it would be completed on new schedule date of January 30, 2015.\
  \ The labourers working in Chandni Chowk and other different project points like\
  \ Rehmanabad and Islamabad on condition of anonymity told this scribe that the project\
  \ is likely to completed in March next year. Giving reasons, they said that there\
  \ is 50 per cent shortage of labourers for such a big project. Those working on\
  \ it, receives only Rs 450 as daily charges, working for more than 12 hours a day.\
  \ \u201COn this daily wage, we have to eat food and tea from our own money and Rs200\
  \ are spent for this purpose each day. A number of middle aged labourers get tired\
  \ during working hours and take almost two hours rest,\u201D they claimed. They\
  \ like other people claimed that work on the project is going on slow note because\
  \ of shortage of 50 per cent staff. If the authorities pay handsome wages then people\
  \ would join as labourers to work on the project, they told. However, replying to\
  \ the claims of the labourers, Hanif Abbasi as well as project director of the MBP,\
  \ Commissioner Zahid Saeed cleared that each labourer is being paid Rs600 as daily\
  \ wages. Those who are receiving Rs450 as claimed by the labourers themselves would\
  \ have been hired by sub contractors who are awarded certain sections of the project.\
  \ However, the chairman assured that he would take up the issue and direct the sub\
  \ contractors for paying the fixed wages of Rs600 to every labourer. Further, Hanif\
  \ Abbasi told that though project was inaugurated on February, however, the first\
  \ contract of it was awarded on March 28, 2014 and work started in mid April. In\
  \ view of this situation, when the project would meet the deadline of January 30,\
  \ then it means only 7 months have been taken in its completion period against the\
  \ 10 months time. The project remained delayed due to political reasons, which is\
  \ Dharnas by PTI and PAT. The sit-in of PTI lasted for 127 days which means four\
  \ months which created hurdle in work on the project in Islamabad section."

  \                           Islamabad The final draft of the new drug pricing policy\
  \ only awaits the Prime Minister\u2019s approval now. While official sources are\
  \ widely praising the policy for offering a comprehensive pricing formula that will\
  \ purge the system of discretion, and for recommending a freeze on prices of drugs\
  \ till June 2016 (at levels of 2013), independent analysts are expressing serious\
  \ reservations about what the policy will eventually entail. \u201CThe role of officials\
  \ in determining or revising the prices of drugs has been done away with. There\
  \ shall be no interaction with officials in matters of price revision. The policy\
  \ not only provides a clear formula under which drug prices would be regulated,\
  \ but also supports that the prices of drugs be frozen till June 2016 at levels\
  \ of 2013, whereafter the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shall be applied,\u201D official\
  \ sources privy to the development confided. What sounds good, at least on the face\
  \ of it, is not all that rosy when seen from the lens of public health experts and\

  \ \u201Cthere is a need to critically review the policy parameters currently outlined\
  \ in the draft policy, which is in the public domain.\u201D  Dr. Sania pointed out\
  \ that \u201CWhilst the current iteration of the drug pricing policy intends to\
  \ purge the system of discretion, it may inadvertently end up doing exactly the\
  \ opposite, since withdrawal of SRO 1002 and mandatory price reductions will lead\
  \ most manufacturers to try and come under the \u2018hardship\u2019 policy umbrella\
  \ and apply to the regulator for exceptions. Far from \u2018purging the system of\
  \ discretion\u2019 as claimed in the title of the policy, this strengthens the regulator\u2019\
  s discretionary role.\u201D Dr. Sania emphasised that price regulation is a very\
  \ tricky and complicated area. As described by her in her book, \u2018Choked Pipes,\u2019\
  \ \u201CThe agenda of price regulation is subject to conflicting political interests\
  \ and lobbying by strong interest groups in the pharmaceutical sector in an environment\
  \ of weak regulation and endemic collusion.\u201D Dr. Sania further states in the\
  \ book that, \u201CIn order to achieve the objective of affordable prices of essential\
  \ medicines, a review of available options is critically important.\u201D On the\
  \ other hand, public health pharmacist Ayyaz Kiani, who is also editor of the \u2018\
  Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice,\u2019 published by BioMed Central,\
  \ UK, thinks it is a good policy for three reasons. \u201CFirstly, it intends to\
  \ remove discretionary powers of the regulators, which is a good step, at least\
  \ in intention, as much will depend on how this policy will be implemented. Secondly,\
  \ the policy makes price increase painless for the industry as they may now follow\
  \ the formula and increase prices annually on their own without having to go through\
  \ cumbersome procedures with DRAP. And thirdly, because there is ample emphasis\
  \ on protecting public interest by giving priority to addressing public health issues.\u201D\
  \ The draft policy is stated to have been finalised by the Policy Board of the Drug\
  \ Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) after inputs from various stakeholder\
  \ organisations namely, the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, Pharma\
  \ Bureau, Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, and public sector stakeholders\
  \ including ministries of Commerce, Industries and Finance, and Board of Investment.\
  \ Ayyaz regretted that no input on the important policy has been sought from the\
  \ civil society or consumer advocates. \u201CMoreover, whatever consultation was\
  \ done with the industry did not help as their point of view has been sidelined;\
  \ they are up in arms against it, and have gone to court. These industry representatives\
  \ strongly disagree with the pricing policy. Such confrontation should have been\
  \ avoided. Regulators cannot expect to regulate a sector intent on failing them.\
  \ It has to be a win-win situation for stakeholders for a public policy to successfully\
  \ deliver the envisaged benefits,\u201D he stated when asked for comments. Commenting\
  \ on prices of drugs being frozen till June 2016 (at levels of 2013), Ayyaz said,\
  \ \u201CThere is no justification for this drastic step, which has been strongly\
  \ contested by the pharmaceutical industry as being too harsh and punitive without\
  \ justification. Personally, I think such retrospective implementation is bad policy,\u201D\
  \ he was of the view. Official sources believe the new policy aims to ensure availability\
  \ of quality drugs at affordable prices to patients on the one hand, and to keep\
  \ the industry viable, ensuring its growth and promoting investment in the country,\
  \ on the other.  Ayyaz viewed this claim with skepticism. \u201CThe industry does\
  \ not think such an objective is being served through this policy; they believe\
  \ it is \u2018disabling\u2019 rather than \u2018enabling\u2019 growth and further\
  \ investment in the sector. The pharma industry (especially its foreign investment\
  \ component) has indeed been lately disinvesting, and prospects of growth already\
  \ seem remote,\u201D he flagged.  Sharing the key features of the drug pricing policy,\
  \ sources confided that drugs have been divided into two categories in terms of\
  \ pricing. The first category, that of scheduled drugs, includes most commonly used\
  \ top 50 drugs, drugs on essential list, drugs for treatment of Cancer, TB, Hepatitis,\
  \ HIV, Thalassaemia and Organ Transplant, biological and new chemical entities.\
  \ In the second category, which is that of non-scheduled drugs, the prices of drugs\
  \ not coming under the scheduled category shall be \u2018partially\u2019 regulated\
  \ in terms of pricing. Commenting on this categorization, Ayyaz said, the top 50\
  \ used drugs is not a good point to start as many non-essential and indeed irrational\
  \ drugs exist in this category, and as such, protecting this group of medicines\
  \ through higher level of control will be counterproductive. \u201CAll the others\
  \ categories in this list have clear public health importance and have been correctly\
  \ prioritized for protection,\u201D he added.  With reference to price fixation\
  \ of new chemical entities (NCEs), the policy document states that price fixation\
  \ of originator brand of NCE shall be based on average price of the same brand in\
  \ India and Bangladesh. If originator brand of NCE has not been marketed in India\
  \ or Bangladesh, its maximum retail price shall be fixed equal to the lowest of\
  \ the following, namely: 1) retail price in developing countries which regulate\
  \ drug prices; 2) whole sale price of in UK Monthly Index of Medical Supplies or\
  \ British National Formulary or Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or New\
  \ Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency. The document also states that the prices\
  \ of generic substitutes of the NCE shall be fixed @ 30% less than the originator\
  \ brand price. Sharing his views, Ayyaz pointed out that all of the above clauses\
  \ depend too much on what goes in other countries, and reflect Pakistani regulators\u2019\
  \ inability to adjudicate prices in Pakistan. The policy also contains a clause\
  \ for price reduction after recovery of research cost, sources claimed. To this\
  \ effect, the document mentions that \u201Cprices of originator brands of new chemical\
  \ entities will be reduced by 30% after 5 years of its registration or when 3 or\
  \ more me-toos/biosimilars have been marketed, whichever is earlier. Ayyaz termed\
  \ this as a good step but emphasized the need for \u201Cclarity on what would be\
  \ the base for calculation of the reduction: whether the starting price or the one\
  \ at the end of the 5th year?\u201D As for increase in prices of drugs, the policy\
  \ stipulates that effective July 1, 2016, annual increase shall be linked with CPI\
  \ of the immediately preceding financial year. \u201CManufacturers and importers\
  \ may increase their existing maximum retail prices of scheduled drugs up to 50%\
  \ of CPI (with a cap of 4%) and maximum retail prices of non-scheduled drugs up\
  \ to 70% of CPI (with a cap of 6%) once in any financial year. The calculation of\
  \ revised maximum retail price shall be intimated to the Authority (Division of\
  \ Costing and Pricing) at least 15 days prior to affecting the increase. Non-intimation\
  \ of prices shall be construed as non-revision of maximum retail prices. The failure\
  \ to intimate the increase in price shall tantamount to nullifying the price increase,\u201D\
  \ sources shared. In order to encourage the production of lower-priced drugs, the\
  \ policy states that drugs whose prices are less than Rs. 2 per tablet/capsule,\
  \ Rs. 2 per 5ml of syrup, Rs. 2 per 1 gm of cream/ointment/gel, Rs. 2 per patch,\
  \ Rs. 4 per sachet, and Rs. 10 per injection shall be deemed to be non-scheduled\
  \ drugs.  Similarly, locally manufactured products approved for export to developed\
  \ countries like USA, UK, EU countries, Japan, Australia or WHO shall be exempted\
  \ from price control in the local market to encourage manufacturing and export of\
  \ quality drugs, subject to the conditions that FOB price for export is not less\
  \ than the ex-factory price in the country. \u201CThis is totally unacceptable as\
  \ a small amount of export of a product would exempt it totally for domestic price\
  \ control. This one clause, in fact, nullifies all the public health benefits of\
  \ regulation through this price,\u201D Ayyaz pointed out.  The policy document also\
  \ states that a procedure shall be devised by the Policy Board to review maximum\
  \ retail prices of drugs which have become non-viable to market. Prices will be\
  \ fixed on the basis of competitive manufacturing cost and will be uniform for all\
  \ companies. \u201CThis will help boost availability of low-priced essential medicines\
  \ which has been a protracted problem in the market. Kudos for this,\u201D Ayyaz\
  \ remarked. The Policy Board has also decided to make amendments in the law so that\
  \ overcharged amounts by the industry/hospital/ retailer plus penalty @ 20% per\
  \ annum will be deposited in the government treasury. Ayyaz said, \u201CThis too\
  \ is a commendable step but will need muscle to implement, which the regulators\
  \ have traditionally lacked.\u201D So before the PM puts his signature on the final\
  \ draft of the drug pricing policy, a review of issues being flagged by independent\
  \ health analysts may help achieve better outcomes in the long run."

text: "The power of the pulpit\n                            It is hard to know the\
  \ exact figures or ratios, but it seems from the anecdotal evidence available that\
  \ at a significant number of the tens of thousands of mosques scattered around the\
  \ country, there was only limited or no condemnation \u2013 during Friday sermons\
  \ \u2013 of the Taliban for the attack on a Peshawar school. At some mosques tacit\
  \ support was later expressed for Maulana Abdul Aziz, the Lal Masjid head who implicitly\
  \ defended the Taliban action.It would be interesting to get more detailed reports\
  \ on precisely what was said and where. It would also be fascinating to have before\
  \ us a full break-up of which mosques fall under the influence of which groups.\
  \ It is known that some of the larger ones in both Islamabad and Lahore are controlled\
  \ by hard-line outfits such as the Ahle Sunnat-wal Jamaat, formerly the fiercely\
  \ anti-Shia Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan. Despite a ban placed in 2012, the ASWJ continues\
  \ to operate, apparently with unlimited freedom, and spread its fierce message of\
  \ hatred.Other equally damaging messages are spread through mosques too. These are\
  \ directed against women, minorities and \u2018western elements\u2019. What they\
  \ do is nudge along the mindset that has created a deeply bigoted society. It is\
  \ a mindset we have now discovered we must fight.To do so successfully, we will\
  \ have to use the mosque and its powerful pulpits. In other words, the imams who\
  \ delivers their sermons every Friday to millions of worshippers have to be won\
  \ over to the right side of the fence. This is the only way to swing opinion and\
  \ make anything resembling real difference. How to achieve this is something the\
  \ National Action Committee set up to combat terrorism must consider in some detail.\
  \ In other Muslim countries, ways have been found to incorporate clerics and religious\
  \ scholars into key social battles. In Iran and Bangladesh, they have been used\
  \ to help promote family planning and in Egypt to speak out against a variety of\
  \ social problems including female genital mutilation. We too have to follow this\
  \ path and send out a strong message that militancy and the ideas that support it\
  \ can simply not be permitted to permeate the thinking of people.All this is also\
  \ linked to other factors. Outfits spreading hatred against specific groups need\
  \ to be acted against and removed from the sphere of the mosque. Right now, it is\
  \ known that many of the clerics who run smaller mosques in towns or big cities\
  \ fall under their broader umbrella. The mosques, especially in small towns where\
  \ rates of unemployment are high, have also become a recruitment place where extremist\
  \ groups pick up aimless young men for their own purposes. Ajmal Kasab, aged 25\
  \ years when he was hanged in an Indian jail in 2012 for his role in the siege of\
  \ Mumbai four years before that, is an example of the manner in which this process\
  \ takes place. We need to bring it to a halt.Somehow, the clerics delivering weekly\
  \ sermons in mosques need to be brought over to speak against militancy. The key\
  \ problem of course is the funding that comes in to too many mosques or groups linked\
  \ to them in the country, in some cases from sources outside our borders. Nations\
  \ like Bangladesh have found it possible to begin schemes where mosque imams are\
  \ paid to deliver the right kind of messages. We could replicate this model. But\
  \ it would be possibly only if the government was able to surpass the scale of money\
  \ provided by far richer agents who have become key players in the game of death\
  \ in which we are pawns.Spreading messages that alter the manner in which people\
  \ think is nevertheless vital. The media of course could be a central player in\
  \ this. Right now, we have clerics who go along with a particular code of thought\
  \ taught to them at madressahs and by their own teachers. This suggests to them\
  \ that they need to support hard-line views in various ways and inculcate more and\
  \ more people into a specific mould. The mosque, notably since the Zia years, has\
  \ played a key part in creating this mould. It must now play an equal part in breaking\
  \ it.Those who regularly attend mosques speak of the pamphlets distributed within\
  \ many of them, promoting banned groups, or the attempts to collect funds for these\
  \ organizations. In some cases, the clerics of the mosques may not even be aware\
  \ of the nature of the groups they are collecting for. Many are, after all, only\
  \ semi-literate themselves and some may believe they are truly serving a good cause.\
  \ These men who hold significant influence in our society need to be re-educated\
  \ and retrained. A massive scheme of some kind needs to be adopted for this purpose.\
  \ This has been achieved to a certain degree in countries like Egypt, mainly through\
  \ the efforts of the Al-Azhar University in Cairo which stands at the centre of\
  \ the more enlightened views on religion. It is possibly arguable as to why we should\
  \ need to turn to religion in this fashion within our state. After all, it is no\
  \ obscure fact that killing is wrong and the murder of children one of the worst\
  \ offences possible under any rule of humanity or religion. But it appears we need\
  \ to be reminded of this more forcefully than is currently the case. Yes, the Peshawar\
  \ episode has evoked a great deal of shock and horror. But, we need to move forward\
  \ in a way that it is ensured it is not forgotten and never repeated. This can be\
  \ possible only if we are able to alter a great deal about the kind of society we\
  \ have become and remove certain elements that play such a big part in shaping it.Linked\
  \ to the mosque is the question of madressah schools. These have mushroomed primarily\
  \ because of the collapse of the public sector education system. Only a few amongst\
  \ them offer anything resembling actual training in militancy. But almost all pass\
  \ on a particular pattern of thought which in the limited surveys conducted indicates\
  \ learning to see India as an enemy nation and regarding women as being inherently\
  \ inferior. A large number of the clerics who run these mosques have themselves\
  \ emerged from madressahs. These institutes then need to be looked at very carefully\
  \ and policies adopted to at least offer people more options about where they can\
  \ educate their children rather than keeping them within seminaries simply on the\
  \ basis that there is no other place where they can be given education free of all\
  \ cost and also provided food and shelter.These are all matters we need to pay greater\
  \ heed to. The action taken recently against specific clerics promoting hatred is\
  \ welcome. The fact that the judges who wrote out arrest orders in these cases are\
  \ in need of protection tells us just how difficult the task we face is. But the\
  \ mosque and the pulpit need to play a central role in changing the face of our\
  \ country \u2013 which has grown uglier by the decade. We should hear words of true\
  \ wisdom once spoken from the buildings that symbolise our religion. It is sad this\
  \ is not the case today. The writer is a freelance columnist and former newspaper\

text: "NA-123 faces civic problems, upsurge in crime\n                           \
  \ LAHORESLACKNESS on part of civic bodies as well as police has added to the woes\
  \ of the people living in different areas falling under NA-123, Lahore VI, which\
  \ proved a PML-N stronghold in the last general elections. The poor performance\
  \ of Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) and Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC)\
  \ in their respective domains as well as the alarming increase in the street crime\
  \ and failure of police in curbing it are the two core issues confronted by the\
  \ people of NA-123, Lahore VI. Besides, other issues which need immediate attention,\
  \ according the local population include streets inundated due to rains, heavily\
  \ encroached main roads and routine traffic mess mainly due to the absence of traffic\
  \ wardens. Keeping in view the last general election results, NA-123, Lahore VI\
  \ can rightly be called a PML-N bastion as its ticket-holder Pervaiz Malik emerged\
  \ victorious by getting more than 120,000 votes. The votes bagged by the PML-N candidate\
  \ on this seat were more than the party head Nawaz Sharif, who could get around\
  \ 92,000 votes from NA-120. However, the local people believe that justice wasn\u2019\
  t done to them according to the level of confidence they had shown into the party.\
  \ The provincial constituencies falling under NA-123 are PP-143 and PP-144 where\
  \ Chaudhry Shahbaz Ahmed and Bau Akhter are sitting MPAs. Shahbaz has returned for\
  \ his second term and he is also the Vice Chairman of WASA. The major areas falling\
  \ in this constituency include a big portion of Shadbagh (rest falls in NA-119)\
  \ comprised of Amir Road, Bhamman and Jhuggian Villages, Bhagatpura, China Scheme,\
  \ Gujjarpura, Alya Town, Shawala Chowk, Janipura, Ghoray Shah, ample portion of\
  \ GT Road near Baghbanpura. Most of the development in the area took place after\
  \ the Local Government polls of 2001 and 2005. Most of the areas of NA-123, particularly\
  \ pertaining to China Scheme and Gujjarpura side are a picture of neglect, which\
  \ local people believe is due to multiple reasons such as apathy of the elected\
  \ representatives, poor performance of the government bodies and above all, the\
  \ absence of local bodies which could well tackle the issues like past. The survey\
  \ conducted in the constituency found that most of the open grounds had turned into\
  \ dumping ground and local people complained that not a single time, any staffer\
  \ of LWMC bothered to remove filth. What has added to the troubles of the local\
  \ population is stagnant water in the open areas, which has become a permanent breeding\
  \ ground for mosquitoes, which not necessarily cause dengue, but could cause malaria\
  \ outbreak.A group of students while talking to The News complained that they were\
  \ yet to see the elected representatives in their areas and due to their lack of\
  \ concern, the officials from different departments never pay attention towards\
  \ these areas. A ground, just in front of a well-known girls college in China Scheme,\
  \ near the drain is filled with fresh water and is a breeding place for dengue mosquito,\
  \ which has played havoc with hundreds of lives during last six to eight years in\
  \ Lahore, remained unchecked. Imran, one of the boys who have turned up to play\
  \ cricket there told The News that not only in this particular area, even in many\
  \ adjacent parts, filth had become a common sight but there had been no measures\
  \ to remove it. However, the people have also taken a sigh of relief over the repair\
  \ work being carried out on the Shadbagh-China Scheme drain, which is more than\
  \ 3km long and whose boundary wall at different points had been broken and posing\
  \ serious life risk to commuters. The boundary wall of this drain had been raised\
  \ from different sides and at some points, even more than 40 feet area of the wall\
  \ washed away by the rains in September. On most of the occasions, attention of\
  \ the relevant quarters was drawn through different sources to build the boundary\
  \ wall of the drain which could prove hazardous in case any bus or vehicle carrying\
  \ passengers falls into it. Local people stated that number of times, motorcyclists\
  \ had fallen into the drain and faced serious injuries and now after local MNA Pervaiz\
  \ Malik and MPA Chaudhry Shahbaz took notice, the repair work has been started.\
  \ Local people told The News that even before the September rains which caused huge\
  \ loss to the wall of the drain, most of the its points were damaged which also\
  \ resulted in accidents and were an open death trap. Besides, a positive development\
  \ in the area is regarding the condition of public parks which have improved as\
  \ compared to past, when most of them were not only a picture of neglect, but also\
  \ safe havens for drug addicts in the evening.Apart from a boys college, the Punjab\
  \ government has also set up a degree college for women in the area and local people\
  \ hailed this initiative. Shaista Pervaiz Malik, wife of the sitting MNA Pervaiz\
  \ Malik and herself an MNA on seats reserved for women also seem active in party\
  \ affairs in the constituency.Street crimeStreet crime is another prime matter of\
  \ concern for most of the local people who said that in the area of Shadbagh, particularly\
  \ near Amir Road, Bhagatpura, Pir Ronki Park needed proper police attention. The\
  \ area of NA-123, particularly falling mostly under PP-143 is the precinct of two\
  \ police stations, including Shadbagh and Gujjarpura. One of it, Shadbagh falls\
  \ in City Division which is headed by SP Asad Sarfaraz Khan. Gujjarpura Police Station\
  \ is the part of Civil Lines Division which is headed by SP Imtiaz Sarwar.Situation\
  \ in Shadbagh witnessed some improvement in the area since the new SP took over\
  \ in June this year, unfortunately, local police failed to ensure proper security\
  \ of citizens later. Only in the month of December, the incidents of bike snatching,\
  \ bike theft, robbery have witnessed a drastic rise as compared to the past months,\
  \ since the new SHO, Sub Inspector Mohammad Raza took over the charge. In the latest\
  \ incident occurring on December 28 (Sunday), Fahad, a student and resident of Chaudhry\
  \ Park, Shadbagh was deprived of his new motorbike by two armed motorcyclists, which\
  \ he had purchased just a night ago. Fahad was just on his way to home and quite\
  \ close to his house, he was intercepted by two armed men who, at gunpoint snatched\
  \ his new motorbike and fled from the scene. According to his family, the emergency\
  \ 15 call was done soon after the incident but it took more than 30 minutes for\
  \ the police team to reach the spot. The FIR of the incident has been registered.\
  \ In the month of December, Fayiz, a student was deprived of his bike in daylight.The\
  \ incident took place near old Wapda office situated close to Akram Park, Shadbagh.\
  \ FIR was registered but so far no progress had been made in the case.Family of\
  \ Fayiz told The News that unknown persons broke into their house last year and\
  \ made away with a bike. So, in 2013 and 2014, the same family had been deprived\
  \ of the vehicles twice. Most of the people in the constituency complained that\
  \ no elected representatives visited them to inquire about their condition. Similarly,\
  \ Sajjad, a trader lost his motorbike which was parked just outside his residence\
  \ on December 17 from Chaudhry Park. However, the incident which exposes the level\
  \ of law and order is related with a robbery which took place on a department store\
  \ owned by a youth named Abdul Qadeer. On December 10, Abdul Qadeer was sitting\
  \ in his store when three unidentified men, at gunpoint robbed him of around Rs30,000\
  \ cash. The incident took place in the evening. What shocks most of the local people\
  \ is the fact that this wasn\u2019t the first incident on this shop, as three persons,\
  \ this year had also deprived the shop owner of his laptop, mobile phones and around\
  \ Rs90,000 in the month of April. At that time, Inspector Kamran Zaman was SHO Shadbagh\
  \ whereas Imtiaz Sarwar was in-charge of the City Division. The shop owner time\
  \ and again visited the police station but no official paid any heed towards his\
  \ complaint and this time, having faced another robbery, the heartbroken citizen\
  \ didn\u2019t visit the police station. When contacted, Abdul Qadeer stated that\
  \ in the same year, he had been robbed twice but not a single police official visited\
  \ his shop to probe the incident, although the police station was situated just\
  \ a few yards away from his store. Sufyan and Hamza, two brothers who run a mobile\
  \ shop, in the front lane of Qadeer\u2019s store at Amir Road, have also been looted\
  \ by a two dacoits who, after entering the shop snatched cash from a salesman and\
  \ after threatening of dire consequences, left the shop while drawing its shutter\
  \ down a couple of months ago.In the same week, Shaukat Ali, a resident of Gujjarpura\
  \ on his way to home was deprived of around Rs100,000 cash, ATM cards and other\
  \ documents by unidentified armed persons near Ilahi Town. Due to lack of police\
  \ patrolling, the incident of car mirror theft have also become a routine in the\
  \ area. Javed, a resident of Ferozepark, told The News that since 2011, more than\
  \ 10 times, the mirror of his car had been stolen by unknown persons but only verbal\
  \ assurances were given to him by the police. Within last three months, Javed lost\
  \ side mirrors of his car at night and according to him, the price of a new pair\
  \ is around Rs20,000 but, he had now started buying second hand sets which are not\
  \ less than Rs15,000. Sikander Khan, another resident, and a travel agent by profession\
  \ was deprived of cash, mobile phones and laptop by unknown armed persons in September\
  \ this year just outside his residence, when he was coming back from work. In the\
  \ very next street, unknown persons made away with a sacrificial bull, worth Rs0.1\
  \ million from Ferozepark, just a few days before Eidul Azha. The bull belonged\
  \ to Syed Farooq Iftikhar, a local resident who had tied it just outside his house.\
  \ In all the above cases, so far the victims said that no progress had been made.In\
  \ the area of Chaudhry Park, a few hundred yards from police station, number of\
  \ incidents had occurred and people seemed greatly perturbed due to police failure\
  \ in curbing such occurrences. The ring road underpass, which is a link between\
  \ rest of Shadbagh and Ring Road, near Pir Ronqi graveyard has become a risky area\
  \ for most of the persons. Naeem, a businessman, was also deprived of cash, mobile\
  \ sets and other valuables a few months ago. The local police officials claimed\
  \ that they were making the all-out effort to curb crime and nab the criminals.\
  \ SHO of Shadbagh Police Station Mohammad Raza stated that police lacked proper\
  \ wireless system and patrolling vehicles which had been taken back by the authorities.\
  \ There was a dire need to facilitate police, recruit more contingents so that they\
  \ could take proper care of this big area. Asad Sarfaraz, SP of City Division told\
  \ The News that situation in his division was \u2018under control\u2019 and police\
  \ had busted gangs and recovered looted material from them. He said in winter, the\
  \ wave of crime increased but at the same time, police was committed to eliminate\
  \ crime. In the area of Gujjarpura, local people expressed dissatisfaction over\
  \ the police role in curbing street crimes. However, Qamar Abbas, the local SHO\
  \ when contacted said the all-out effort had been made to control crime in the area.\
  \ He said street crime was an international issue. He said there had been complaints\
  \ in the past but situation was improving now and number of street crime incidents\
  \ had come down. Imtiaz Sarwar, SP Civil Lines Division when contacted said the\
  \ police teams had been assigned duties in their respective areas to maintain peace.\
  \ He said all the required measures had been taken to ensure security of the citizens.Traffic\
  \ and encroachments: Traffic mess has also become a routine in most parts of the\
  \ constituency which included Amir Road, Shadbagh-China Scheme drain road, Sher\
  \ Shah Road but traffic wardens are seen seldom in these parts. Moreover, major\
  \ roads, including ample portion of GT Road, falling in PP-144 are heavily encroached\
  \ which cause routine traffic mess. The matter had also been taken up in Punjab\
  \ Assembly by the MPA Bau Akhter and another female MPA hailing from the area, Raheela\
  \ Khadim Hussein. However, no action, so far has been taken.Local Representatives\u2019\
  \ views: MNA Pervaiz Malik told The News that there was no denying the fact that\
  \ there were issues which needed solution but at the same time, the PML-N government\
  \ had also left no stone unturned in providing every possible relief to the people.\
  \ He said as an MNA, he was totally connected with the people of his constituency\
  \ and his doors were always open for them. He said PML-N was committed to provide\
  \ maximum relief to the public. Chaudhry Shahbaz Ahmed, the MPA elected from PP-143\
  \ said special focus had been laid to improve the situation of schools, colleges,\
  \ roads but despite all steps, there were always room for improvement. He said the\
  \ government would take all steps to address the complaints of local people regarding\
  \ any department.Bau Akhter, MPA elected from PP-144 while talking to The News stated\
  \ there was no doubt that basic issues concerning public were there in the constituency\
  \ but at the same time, concrete measures had been taken by the government to address\
  \ them. He said in order to address the issue of clean drinking water, the chief\
  \ minister had taken special initiatives. Besides, he said the people in his constituency\
  \ also faced environmental issues due the presence of factories situated in the\
  \ residential areas. However, he said measures were also underway to tackle this\
  \ issue. Regarding law and order, he said shortage of police force was the prime\
  \ cause behind this issue which certainly needed to be addressed. He said presence\
  \ of a local government was necessary in addressing the basic public issues."

text: "2014 darkest year in terms of polio eradication\n                         \
  \   ISLAMABAD: The year 2014 was one of the darkest years in terms of polio eradication\
  \ in Pakistan with around 300 polio cases, highest in last 16 years, and killing\
  \ of dozens of polio workers across the country but the government is hopeful that\
  \ its National Action Plan against terrorism would also help the country in defeating\
  \ polio.Also in 2014, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it mandatory\
  \ for Pakistanis travelling abroad to receive at least one dose of anti-polio vaccine,\
  \ since the country was accused of exporting the virus to other regions. According\
  \ to the UN health body, Pakistan accounts for 94% of the world polio cases while\
  \ the country has recorded a 300 percent increase in these cases during 2014 from\
  \ 93 to 295 so far while hundreds of samples are still being tested in National\
  \ Institute of Health (NIH). Nigeria and Afghanistan are the only two other countries\
  \ with endemic polio but both have recorded decrease in polio cases in 2014. Nigeria\
  \ recorded 450% decrease in polio cases last year as the number went down from 50\
  \ to 12.Pakistani health official claims that polio has largely become a security\
  \ related issue as 85 percent of the polio cases have been reported from security\
  \ compromised areas where vaccination teams cannot immunise the children owing to\
  \ fear of attacks. According to official figures 74 polio workers have been killed\
  \ so far in Pakistan since 2012.An official working with polio eradication programme\
  \ said it was a massive communication failure on the part of the authorities as\
  \ around 50,000 families have refused to vaccinate their children against polio\
  \ owing to doubts about the programme despite huge media campaign by the government\
  \ and Unicef. He said 50,000 is recorded figure of refusal cases while rough estimates\
  \ suggest that over 150,000 families have refused polio vaccination, but the polio\
  \ teams are reluctant to record these refusal cases as it would indicate their power\
  \ performance.\u201CIt is a communication failure as almost all segments of society\
  \ have doubts or concerns about polio vaccine,\u201D said a top official with polio\
  \ eradication programme requesting anonymity.He said upper class has doubts about\
  \ polio workers\u2019 hygiene and quality of the vaccine so they may opt for private\
  \ vaccination. The middle class is angry with government\u2019s lack of focus on\
  \ development and other health needs of people so they doubt why polio is given\
  \ priority, he said adding that lower class think polio vaccine is a conspiracy\
  \ against Muslims hatched by West to reduce the population of Muslims. They also\
  \ cite the example of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) spy Shakeel Afridi who used\
  \ a fake polio campaign to trace Osama Bin Laden in Abbotabad.The official said\
  \ the authorities have failed to devise an effective communication strategy to convince\
  \ all three segments of society about the need, utility and efficacy of polio vaccine.\u201C\
  Ulema have been used on TV advertisements to support polio vaccination, but a large\
  \ number of people who refuse polio vaccine on religious grounds do not watch TV\
  \ at all. There is a need of localized communication strategies with cultural consideration\
  \ of each area to effectively eliminate doubts about polio programme,\u201D the\
  \ official said.He said Unicef is brining foreign communication experts to devise\
  \ communication plan for the rural areas of Pakistan, but these experts are not\
  \ aware of indigenous culture.However, when contacted by The News, the head of Prime\
  \ Minister\u2019s Polio Monitoring and Coordination Cell, Ayesha Farooq, said the\
  \ government has re-devised its strategy against polio which will show results in\
  \ next few months.She said the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has expressed personal\
  \ resolve to eliminate polio from the country and drastic measures have been taken\
  \ during last few months in this regard.She said 85 percent cases of polio have\
  \ been recorded in security compromised areas of Waziristan, Khyber Agency, Peshawar\
  \ and Karachi.\u201CAs many as 241 polio cases (81.7 percent) were reported this\
  \ year from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Fata which indicates a direct correlation between\
  \ incidence of polio cases and access issues due to security,\u201D she said.Ayesha\
  \ Farooq, who is also the legislator of ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), said\
  \ innovative measures have been taken by the government with the involvements of\
  \ provinces.\u201CRoutine immunisation will also be increased as a part of new strategy.\
  \ Media is being used to spread the message, and the help of parliamentarians and\
  \ civil society is being sought for this national cause,\u201D she said.\u201CDuring\
  \ 2014, a total of 17 National, Sub-National and short interval polio campaigns\
  \ were conducted to immunize the target population of 34.6 million children below\
  \ five years of age for each national campaign,\u201D she added.The official figures\
  \ show that on an average 92 percent of the total target population were reached\
  \ during these campaigns. In addition more than 16 million children travelling within\
  \ and from outside the country were vaccinated through Permanent Transit Posts (PTPs)\
  \ working in multiple shifts throughout the country at key points during the year.\
  \ At present only wild polio virus Type 1 is circulating in Pakistan while Type\
  \ 2 was eradicated several years ago and no case of Type 3 virus has been reported\
  \ from anywhere in the country since April 2012.The most recent official data puts\
  \ the total number of confirmed polio cases at 295 in 2014 with 174 cases reported\
  \ from Fata, 67 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 29 from Sindh, 22 from Balochistan and\
  \ 03 from Punjab.Also important to note is that of the 73 wild poliovirus cases\
  \ in Khyber Agency, 59 are from Tehsil Bara, 12 from Jamrud and two from Tirah.\
  \ Also, all wild polio cases except one from Khyber Agency this year have been reported\
  \ from May onwards. Furthermore, vaccination activities have been considerably inconsistent\
  \ in Bara Tehsil of Khyber Agency since June 2009, missing a significant number\
  \ of children.All except 10 polio cases reported from North and South Waziristan\
  \ agencies in 2014 did not receive any dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV). It is important\
  \ to mention that no supplementary immunisation activities have been conducted in\
  \ North and most of South Waziristan agencies since June 2012, leading to an ongoing\
  \ explosive polio outbreak with 37 wild polio cases in 2013 and 93 so far in 2014.The\
  \ district of Peshawar has reported 29 wild poliovirus cases in 2014 so far. The\
  \ reintroduction of wild polio virus with the identification of polio cases from\
  \ the districts of Swat, Kohat, Naseerabad, Pishin and Larkana is a concern which\
  \ also reinforces the fact that the presence of polio virus anywhere is a threat\
  \ everywhere.Of all the polio affected children in 2014 as many as 92 percent came\
  \ from families that speak Pashto and more than 84 percent children are below the\
  \ age of 2 years. It would also be important to add here that 85 percent of the\
  \ polio cases this year are from insecure and security compromised areas and 86\
  \ percent of the children did not receive any routine dose while 64 percent did\
  \ not receive any routine and Polio campaign dose.Ninety-nine percent of parents\
  \ across Pakistan come forward and vaccinate their children every time Polio vaccine\
  \ is offered while the refusals, which are below 1 percent of the target population,\
  \ are based on repeated campaign, religious belief or other misconceptions. According\
  \ to experts the current low transmission season is critical to fighting polio as\
  \ the virus is less active and its transmission can be stopped through repeated\
  \ high quality campaigns."
