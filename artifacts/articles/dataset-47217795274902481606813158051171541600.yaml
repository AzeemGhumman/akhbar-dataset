text: "Facebook likely be the publisher of everything, says Prof Craig Duff\nThe News\
  \ International got an opportunity to have a Q & A with Prof Craig Duff - an award-winning\
  \ video journalist and television documentary director, producer and writer, specializing\
  \ in multi-platform storytelling and solo journalism.\nDuff was the director of\
  \ multimedia and chief video journalist for TIME, where he oversaw video and other\
  \ multimedia projects for the magazine\u2019s digital platforms and TIME.com.\n\
  He is the focal person on a US-funded project to establish a journalism school at\
  \ the IBA in partnership with Medill and the ICFJ.What prospects moved Medill to\
  \ partner with a Pakistani institution to establish a world class journalism institute?\
  \ How did you become part of it?\nDr. Lawrence Pintak, who is founding dean of \u201C\
  The Edward R. Murrow College of Communication\u201D at Washington State University\
  \ was based in Cairo some years ago running a centre very similar to what we\u2019\
  re building here called the \u201CKamal Adham Center for Journalism Training and\
  \ Research\u201D at The American University. Larry worked to sort out and gauge\
  \ the needs and interests of journalists and editors and media corporations here,\
  \ and what the issues are and what was needed for training under a US funded project\
  \ for establishing a journalism school. Then we bid on the project and were chosen\
  \ for the grant. So I knew that was happening and when the ICFJ wanted to bid on\
  \ it they needed to find a partner school so they called me because I knew everybody\
  \ basically in the whole chain. I had worked with Larry in Cairo at the Adham Centre,\
  \ and I got involved in this because I know the people who wrote the proposal for\
  \ the US government.\nWhat\u2019s the structure of CEJ-Medill partnership; can we\
  \ say that CEJ would be a replica of Medill?\nWe are really trying to create something\
  \ more permanent so our people won\u2019t be involved and we\u2019re going to help\
  \ train people who will carry it forward. So we\u2019re hoping that some people\
  \ will come through our programme in Chicago after that we\u2019ll train those folks\
  \ and they\u2019ll come and be the faculty.\nYou have conducted a successful training\
  \ session with local journalists; what\u2019s your observation?\nMy only experience\
  \ was the two-week \u201CBackpack/Mobile Multimedia Training\u201D course back in\
  \ October 2014 and I think this was the most rewarding international training experience\
  \ I\u2019ve ever had. Everyone who has come back from teaching here has had an extraordinary\
  \ experience and the key things they say are the eagerness among the people who\
  \ are attending to learn, to think differently about journalism. Our impact is only\
  \ measured by what happens once we leave if people apply what they\u2019ve learned\
  \ and started doing it. And it\u2019s great when you see that happening. The institute\
  \ is going to have the facility that will have a working studio and editing facilities\
  \ so they\u2019ll be able to train pretty much any technology here.\nWhat are the\
  \ dos and don\u2019ts for a journalist?\nIn television we don\u2019t set anything\
  \ up, you don\u2019t ask someone to repeat something so you can get a shot of it;\
  \ when you try to be in a place where things are happening and you get the shot\
  \ but you don\u2019t say \u2018could you fire that rifle again please so I can get\
  \ a better shot or I can get a better angle\u2019. We try not to stage things. But\
  \ that is pretty common in TV here.You have to be honest with your audience.\nHow\
  \ do you think electronic media has impacted the print media?\nNow, the newspaper\
  \ has to figure out ways to serve their readers what they\u2019ve already heard\
  \ the news on TV. They have to think of different ways of telling stories and giving\
  \ something else, something extra - an analysis or a context to the story.\nYou\
  \ arranged a student exchange program last year, how do you think such exchanges\
  \ are going to bring professionals closer?\nI think any time two people from two\
  \ cultures get together and work together you are going to have something interesting\
  \ happen and people will learn from each other. That\u2019s always good.\nIn today\u2019\
  s world, technology is changing the way we consume media; where are we heading?\n\
  Just look at the amount of change that has happened over your lifetime in terms\
  \ of how things were produced. It is extraordinary for me to think that I can shoot\
  \ something on mobile, edit it and bring it on my laptop. Pace of things happening\
  \ is so much faster in the past two years that who is to say that in five years\
  \ what we will be doing.\nRight now the big emphasis in news has really been about\
  \ this (mobile) device, not necessarily to record news but to play it or to view\
  \ it. And mobile is basically is how a lot of us in the west are getting our news\
  \ now \u2013 we are all getting hunched now sort of watching this thing all the\
  \ time. So social media is driving it, so that is a huge change in the past few\
  \ years as away from the web to mobile and now mobile is the big focus. Who is to\
  \ say what is going to happen next? It\u2019s probably going to be something portable\
  \ and something very easy for someone to see \u2013 but it has changed our habits\
  \ of how we consume news. I would say the web page homepage doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ anymore for the New York Times or Times magazine because no one goes there, Facebook\
  \ is the new homepage. Earlier, journalists acted as watchdog and decide what should\
  \ masses know but now with growing influence of reader\u2019s feedback we are witnessing\
  \ a reverse trend and journalists now focus on what people want to read\nIt\u2019\
  s sort of a double-edged sword because it is great to have feedback and you understand\
  \ where the viewers are reading by their comments. I think the watchdog role (of\
  \ media) is the very bedrock of journalism that we are there to serve a purpose\
  \ to keep those in power from doing crazy things or to at least make sure that there\
  \ is a check on power and it\u2019s a vital role.\nSocial media companies are taking\
  \ over the publisher\u2019s space and business too, how it\u2019s going to affect\
  \ media outlets?\nFacebook I think will like to be the publisher of everything and\
  \ be the only source of where people get stuff. So software companies are trying\
  \ to become the new publishers and they have a lot of power as they have the audience.\
  \ They\u2019ve already got partnerships with NY Times and National Geographic and\
  \ some others to publish directly. And we\u2019ll see where that goes. The thing\
  \ is that Facebook is only 12 years old who is to say in five years this is going\
  \ to be the biggest technology or software or whatever company surges ahead of them.\n\

  \           KARACHI: As independent scientists, environmentalists and civil society\
  \ organizations continue their campaign to oppose Pakistan\u2019s decision to build\
  \ two more nuclear reactors in Karachi, scientists, engineers and management at\
  \ Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) insist that the country\u2019s move is the\
  \ most viable option to generate clean energy to overcome its lingering power crisis.Pakistan\
  \ is building two more nuclear reactors of 1100 megawatt each at Karachi coast in\
  \ collaboration with China to overcome crippling energy crisis. The twin plants\
  \ are scheduled to generate 2200 megawatt electricity within next five-six years.During\
  \ a visit to country\u2019s first nuclear facility, the KANUPP and site of K2 and\
  \ K3, reporters were briefed on the safety measures as well as its prospects as\
  \ viable and effective contributor to power generation.Afzar Minhaj, general manager\
  \ of KANNUP, said Pakistan has saved millions of dollars in oil export bills due\
  \ to power generations at country\u2019s nuclear reactors.A detailed presentation\
  \ during the briefing argued: \u201CThe nuclear energy is only affordable mature\
  \ option for clean energy. Karachi that too is faced with acute power shortage has\
  \ to contribute in energy generation rather to remain dependent. K-2 and K-3 projects\
  \ will provide clean energy, overcoming the power shortage and leaving minimum impact\
  \ on environment\u201D.To a question as to why the country can\u2019t rely on solar,\
  \ wind and hydro options for power generation, the authorities believed that Karachi\
  \ is not the best place to take advantage of these alternatives.\u201CYou need 500\
  \ acres land to establish a solar energy plant of 100 megawatt while K-2 and K-3\
  \ that will generate 2200 megawatt energy are being built on 585 acres. This space\
  \ is enough to set up more such plants,\u201D said Azfar Minhaj.\u201DHe said the\
  \ hydro power generation, though environment friendly, has certain issues as well\
  \ and so is the case with solar power.Discussing public perception on nuclear disasters,\
  \ he said concerns about radiation related emergencies in power plants originally\
  \ emanate from World War II nuclear attacks on Japan.Citing different reports from\
  \ international organizations on nuclear accidents, he said more deaths were caused\
  \ by evacuation than radioactivity in Japan\u2019s Fukushima disaster that was caused\
  \ by a tsunami in 2011. \u201CNot a single death was caused due to radioactivity\
  \ in Three Miles Island fiasco despite core meltdown while 28 deaths were caused\
  \ by Chernobyl accident due to radioactivity.\u201D\u201CWe have built our plants\
  \ 12 meter above sea level after conducting a seismic survey based on past Tsunami\
  \ that hit Karachi cost in 1945. The solid structure and strict safety measures\
  \ at KNUPP completely rule out the doomsday scenario where power plants are destroyed\
  \ but Karachi survives.\u201DA senior official said mock evacuations and other such\
  \ exercises were also undertaken in adjacent areas as part of a contingency plan\
  \ to cope up with emergencies. Apart from that, he said 10 detectors have also been\
  \ installed in 10 different areas of the city that gauge the radioactivity. Some\
  \ areas including Sadder, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Orangi Town, Federal B Area, North Karachi,\
  \ Drig Colony, KANUPP Colony, Abdul Rehman Goth and Faqeer Muhammad Goth were also\
  \ under KANNUP surveillance.The KANNUP has also setup a Desalination Demonstration\
  \ Plant in its premises that has been catering its needs for drinking and other\
  \ purposes since 2010. A senior official said the plant at KANNUP is producing 400,000\
  \ gallons water per day that not only meets its own needs, but \u201Cwe are also\
  \ supplying it to nearby villages through tankers\u201D.The KANNUP is also making\
  \ efforts to address health issues of the people living in nearby villages through\
  \ sending mobile nursing units. \u201CWe have frequently arranged gatherings with\
  \ elders of nearby Goths to resolve their issues that they share with us,\u201D\
  \ he said.All in all, with more and more countries embarking on plans to lay their\
  \ hands on civil nuclear technology, it seems Islamabad too is not ready to miss\
  \ out on its socioeconomic development. It appears determined to go ahead with its\
  \ civil nuclear program to overcome power crisis that has crippled the country\u2019\
  s economy."

  \ have today chosen hope over fear and unity over division,\u201D he added.\nThe\

  \ is a huge personal setback for the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) chairman Imran\
  \ Khan who openly endorsed Zac Goldsmith and campaigned for his former brother-in-law\
  \ \u2013 Jemima Goldsmith\u2019s younger brother.\nIn an interview with Hamid Hamid\
  \ on Geo News, Imran Khan said that he was proud to support Zac Goldsmith because\
  \ he originally urged him to enter politics. The PTI leader then expressed his support\
  \ for Zac Goldsmith on 23rd of March on Twitter. Imran Khan told his followers:\
  \ \u201CZac Goldsmith is running for Mayor of London. Have known him for 20 years.\
  \ He is an honourable man with strong convictions and compassion. Zac is a man of\
  \ integrity with a commitment to justice. He has the leadership capabilities to\

  \ is the answer to Pakistan\u2019s problem\u201D. He said that he considered himself\

  \ and party chair Sayeeda Warsi said that Zac Goldsmith had become unrecognisable\
  \ to her and that his campaign team was \u201Cdestroying\u201D him through attacks\

  \ and will serve diligently. he said that he will use his tenure to try to improve\
  \ trade relations between pakistan and the UK.\nMillions of Pounds were spent by\
  \ the Tory campaign on telling voters that Sadiq Khan was a Pakistani, Muslim, terror\
  \ sympathiser and hence he should not be trusted.\nZac Goldsmith was supported by\
  \ Prime Minister David Cameron as the duo joined forced and used every trick in\

  \ Khan during live transmission on the state television.\nDavid Cameron at the prime\

  \ having already said on Twitter that he had attended a political event with Conservative\
  \ candidate Zac Goldsmith and had supported the local Tory challenger to Khan at\

text: "Sarfraz Merchant refuses to appear before FIA on March 15\nLONDON: Sarfraz\
  \ Merchant, one of the central characters in the MQM-related money-laundering investigation,\
  \ has told the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) investigators that he will be\
  \ unable to appear before it on March 15 to record his statement until the FIA does\
  \ not set its record straight and puts the whole context of the investigation right.\n\
  Merchant set the record straight by telling the FIA that he did not originally accuse\
  \ the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) or its leader Altaf Hussain of receiving money\
  \ from the RAW, India\u2019s main spy agency, but the Scotland Yard, showing proofs.\n\
  Sarfraz Merchant said he has undeniable proofs with him showing that the MQM took\
  \ money from the Indian sources and he indicated that he will cooperate with the\
  \ FIA once amends have been made to the summon, record set straight and inappropriate\
  \ language and threat of punishment withdrawn.\nSarfraz Merchant elaborated that\
  \ it was the Scotland Yard that originally said that the MQM took money from the\
  \ Indian government sources. He said it\u2019s a matter of record that the MQM leaders\
  \ including M Anwar and Tariq Mir accepted before the Scotland Yard investigators\
  \ that they received money from India for several years \u2013 in tune of millions\
  \ of Pounds.\nMerchant said that he came to know about the evidence of the MQM involvement\
  \ with the RAW during his recorded interview with the police in London when he saw\
  \ the shocking evidence when the police investigators revealed it to him. Merchant\
  \ said that he is aware -\_ and has proofs \u2013 that the MQM took money from RAW\
  \ but he was not alone in saying that but the Scotland Yard has said it in writing\
  \ too.\nMerchant said that his only issue is with the FIA letter \u201Cthe way it\
  \ has been presented and written\u201D. He said MQM\u2019s involvement with the\
  \ RAW is a serious matter and must be dealt at the highest level.\nThis correspondent\
  \ has obtained a copy of the hard-hitting letter written by Mr Sarfraz Merchant\
  \ in response to the hurriedly written summon issued by the Federal Investigation\
  \ Agency (FIA) to Sarfraz Merchant, urging him to appear before the committee mandated\
  \ to investigate the alleged links of the MQM with the RAW.\nThe FIA was forced\
  \ into action after Sarfraz Merchant said in a world exclusive with Geo News\u2019\
  \ flagship current affairs show \u2018Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath\u2019 that\
  \ he had been asked by the Scotland Yard investigators during recorded interviews\
  \ if he was aware that the MQM was in the pay of the Indian government sources.\n\
  Sarfraz Merchant said that he had not \u201Clevelled any allegation on any political\
  \ party or its leadership\u201D. He told the FIA that his interview on Geo News\
  \ was \u201Cin connection with a leaked document pertaining to a criminal inquiry\
  \ pending in the United Kingdom\u201D \u2013 i.e., money-laundering investigation\
  \ under the Proceeds of Crimes Act involving Altaf Hussain, M Anwar, Tariq Mir,\
  \ Sarfraz Merchant and two others.\n\u201CI had given my views on the contents of\
  \ that document and some observations of the concerned law enforcement agency of\
  \ UK Scotland Yard, which were brought to my notice being a party to the case during\
  \ my under caution interview on 15th of April,2015. It is therefore incorrect to\
  \ suggest that I have alleged something on a political party,\u201D stressed Sarfraz\
  \ Merchant, while explaining that it was not him but the Scotland Yard which believed\
  \ that the MQM received money from the Indian govt in violation of the UK as well\
  \ as Pakistani electoral laws.\nSarfraz Merchant told the FIA bosses that allegations\
  \ about MQM\u2019s links with RAW emerged first in June last year and he wondered\
  \ what took Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s government so long to come into action\
  \ when the nature of the allegations is of shocking and scandalous nature concerning\
  \ directly to the security of Pakistan. Merchant said that the \u201Csubject matter\
  \ of the criminal investigation in the UK is known to all and has been frequently\
  \ discussed in the media and there is no confusion that the issue is directly related\
  \ to the security of Pakistan\u201D.\nIssuing a hard-hitting critique of the very\
  \ poor handing of the case by the government of Pakistan, Merchant said in the letter:\
  \ \u201CI am surprised to learn that you have initiated action at such a belated\
  \ stage. It would have been proper to contact UK authorities more than a year ago\
  \ for mutual assistance and simultaneous initiation of proceedings in Pakistan;\
  \ unfortunately this was not done.\u201D\nSarfraz Merchant expressed his \u201C\
  disappointment on the language and text of your letter which appears to be an attempt\
  \ to intimidate and pressurize me by indicating criminal action against me and also\
  \ placing the entire onus of the case on my shoulders\u201D. Chaudhary Nisar Ali\
  \ Khan had requested Sarfraz Merchant to assist the FIA in its inquiry but the FIA\
  \ issued a threatening summon to Sarfraz Merchant.\nSarfraz Merchant took exception\
  \ to the fact that the FIA summon was signed off by the Commercial Banking Circle.\_\
  \ Merchant said he believed that \u201Cmatters of national security are required\
  \ to be handled more professionally and not as a typical case of Commercial Banking\
  \ Circle\u201D.\nSarfraz Merchant explained that he was a \u201Cresponsible and\
  \ patriotic citizen\u201D of Pakistan and he felt \u201Cobliged to render complete\
  \ assistance in a matter involving security and integrity of the country in accordance\
  \ with law, however the manner in which the case is being handled especially the\
  \ manner in which summon has been issued reflects that importance and gravity of\
  \ the issue has not been understood by your agency\u201D.\nSarfraz Merchant concluded:\
  \ \u201CUnder such circumstances I will not be able to appear on the 15th of March,\
  \ 2016 for giving my statement until the format/contents of your un-dated letter\
  \ delivered to me by DHL and through Pakistan High Commission, London through Post\
  \ received on 11/03/2016 and 12/03/2016 are corrected referred in Paragraph No 3\
  \ of this letter\u201D."

text: "Guest of Honour status for Pakistan at China\u2019s International Import Expo\n\
  \nBEIJING: The Chinese government has granted the status of \"Guest of Honor\" to\
  \ Pakistan at the China International Import Expo (CIIE) to be held from November\
  \ 5 to 10. This will ensure the provision of all possible facilities and benefits\
  \ to the Pakistani pavilion.The gesture also shows the level of commitment in China\
  \ to make Pakistan part of a shared future, according to an article published by\
  \ Global Times here on Monday.The expo offers a chance for global manufacturers\
  \ and producers to showcase their products in order to gain access to China's market.The\
  \ expo is also an opening for countries participating in the Belt and Road (B&R)\
  \ initiative to boost their infrastructure upgrading and reach wider markets.Pakistan\
  \ is one such country, which is undergoing massive infrastructure development to\
  \ align itself with global transportation and communication networks.The China-Pakistan\
  \ Economic Corridor (CPEC) will create an advanced network of roads, railways and\
  \ a deep-sea port that will boost trade with China, Central Asia and Europe.China\u2019\
  s demand for imported food has been growing steadily, creating a market worth $58.28\
  \ billion last year, a 25 percent increase year-on-year.Pakistan, on the other hand,\
  \ has a largely agrarian economy.With the help of Chinese scientists, local agriculture\
  \ specialists have successfully introduced modern farming techniques.Hybrid rice\
  \ and hybrid wheat have been the most successful products, seeing a marked increase\
  \ in yield.Meanwhile, Pakistani mangoes are also doing well; 10,000 tons of them\
  \ are expected to be exported to China by the end of this year.To take advantage\
  \ of China''s food market, Pakistani producers at the CIIE can offer their own unique\
  \ and cost-effective products.A bigger share of the market in China would translate\
  \ into higher revenues, improved quality and a wider product range.Apart from food,\
  \ there are other Pakistani products with immense potential for export to China,\
  \ including onyx stones, minerals and surgical items.The expo organizers were initially\
  \ expecting around 150,000 purchasing agents, but they have so far registered over\
  \ 160,000. This massive participation will present Pakistan with access to markets\
  \ in other countries as well.As foreign buyers experience the previously unexplored\
  \ Pakistani prospects, new windows of trade will open.Thus, Pakistani businesses\
  \ will expand not just into China, but also internationally.Starting from the port\
  \ of Shanghai, China is rolling out assistance for B&R countries to bring down their\
  \ trade costs.The cargo clearance process has been simplified and a new filing mechanism\
  \ is being built for the CIIE pavilions of these countries.China is also adjusting\
  \ tariffs on certain products, such as nuts from Pakistan, in order to meet the\
  \ demand among domestic consumers.As a follow-up step to the import expo, Pakistani\
  \ manufacturers can take advantage of China's booming e-commerce sector.They can\
  \ utilize this highly developed industry to reach out to more customers than would\
  \ be possible only with physical stores in China.Alibaba Group has acquired Pakistan's\
  \ largest e-commerce portal and its payment arm Alipay is planning to enter the\
  \ Pakistani market this year.These ventures will help local manufacturers export\
  \ goods to China while letting the supply chain infrastructure, which is already\
  \ maturing under the CPEC and B&R initiative, do its job.Pakistan and China are\
  \ developing stronger ties in the rapidly evolving global order."

  \ Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said that former cricket star and PTI Chairman\
  \ Imran Khan should explain why he openly supported Zac Goldsmith during the recent\
  \ bitter London mayoral election campaign, which saw the former winning the biggest\
  \ ever personal mandate in British political history.\nIn his first exclusive interview\
  \ to any Pakistani and South Asian media outlet on Thursday, Sadiq Khan told Geo\
  \ News that Imran Khan\u2019s open endorsement for Zac Goldsmith came as a surprise\
  \ to him.\nThe London mayor said: \u201CImran Khan should explain why he supported\
  \ Zac Goldsmith. When I was little, Imran Khan was my hero. He used to be one of\
  \ the best all-rounders \u2013 1982 and 1987 series were very good, then the world\
  \ cup in 1992. It is sad [that he supported Zac] but this is for IK to answer and\
  \ not me.\u201D\nSadiq Khan, the Labour victor and former cabinet minister under\
  \ Tony Blair, outstripped Boris Johnson's 2008 record to win a landslide 1,310,143\
  \ votes in his race to be Mayor of London, beating his Tory rival Zac Goldsmith\
  \ by nearly half a million votes.\nThe toxic election campaign saw Zac Goldsmith\
  \ branding Sadiq Khan an \u2018extremist, terrorist sympathiser, unsafe, closet\
  \ radical and a threat to Britain\u2019s national security.\u2019 Zac Goldsmith\u2019\
  s attack on sadiq Khan was so racist and Islamophobic that former Tory cabinet minister\
  \ and party leader Sayeeda Warsi openly condemned Zac Goldsmith.\nSadiq Khan told\
  \ this scribe that it was unfortunate that Zac Goldsmith failed on all policies\
  \ and tried to scare off voters by telling that Sadiq Khan is of Pakistani origin\
  \ and Muslim therefore he shouldn\u2019t be trusted.\nSadiq Khan said that he has\
  \ multiple identities and he\u2019s proud of all his identities including his Pakistani\
  \ origin and Muslim faith.\n\u201CCurrently, Pakistan's reputation is not so good.\
  \ My opponents said to people that I come from Pakistan, that I'm a Muslim. The\
  \ interesting thing is that I admitted all this myself: Yes! I am from Pakistan.\
  \ Yes! I'm a Muslim \u2013 but I have policies, values ideas to be the best mayor.\
  \ And I'll be a mayor for all of London, whether the people are Muslims, Christians,\
  \ Jews, Sikhs or Hindus, Buddhists or atheists, I'll still be your mayor.\u201D\n\
  Sadiq Khan accepted that the fight for the second most important job in Britain\
  \ was very tough. He said that his parents taught him how to fight for values and\
  \ be strong in face of odds. He said he couldn\u2019t be where he is today if it\
  \ was not for the values instilled in him by his parents.\n\u201CMy background and\
  \ my values come from my parents. They originate from Pakistan and they're a source\
  \ of pride for me. I always source back to my religion, Islam. If you can help others,\
  \ you can. Don\u2019t be arrogant, don\u2019t be vain. If you get an opportunity,\
  \ then explain to people what type of a country Pakistan is, and what type of a\
  \ religion Islam is. This was my thinking. I am proud of who I am and I have every\
  \ reason to take pride in my being and my values.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that he\
  \ was supported by people of all faiths and people of no faith. \u201CMy victory\
  \ is everyone's victory. The support I received in the shape of campaigning, finance\
  \ and prayers was absolutely fantastic. And we showed the world that London is the\
  \ best city in the world,\u201D he added.\nSadiq Khan told Geo News that he was\
  \ aware that his victory was celebrated across Pakistan and people prayed for his\
  \ victory and held celebrations when he was declared a victor.\n\u201CI received\
  \ messages from friends and supporters about the pride that was felt in Pakistan.\
  \ My parents, grandparents are from Pakistan, my family is still there so I feel\
  \ proud, I feel humbled, and this is a responsibility to show London that a man\
  \ from an Islamic background and Pakistani heritage can help business, can build\
  \ the homes, can fix the transport.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that Tory election campaign\
  \ was negative and counter-productive and it was clear that the Lonodoners rejected\
  \ their message of division and hatred.\n\u201CThe Conservative campaign was extremely\
  \ negative, divisive and desperate. People were doubted about whether it is possible\
  \ for London to choose a mayor and have security around other issues. The support\
  \ we received was fantastic. The biggest ever turnout in election, the biggest vote\
  \ to the winning candidate and we've shown the world that we're the best city in\
  \ the world. And I thank all your viewers (of Geo News) for the best wishes after\
  \ elections. I received lots of messages after May 5. I am deeply thankful to all\
  \ those people. I am very busy at the moment and I can\u2019t thank everyone in\
  \ person but I know their sentiments and value them.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that\
  \ it was a sad fact that the \u201Creputation of our religion Islam is not good\
  \ these days\u201D. He said many people in the world think that all Muslims are\
  \ terrorists and extremists. \u201CSo if we can show them that we're peaceful, law-abiding\
  \ and that we're capable of keeping everyone safe, then the reputation of Islam\
  \ will improve.\u201D\nKhan has said he is not a Muslim leader, not a spokesperson\
  \ of Islam and not the representative of Muslims but he had made it clear that he\u2019\
  s a practicing Muslim and observes Ramazan.\nHe told Geo News that fasting for 19\
  \ hours a day in the UK is not an easy task especially when there\u2019s a round\
  \ the clock job to do at the City Hall but he said that Islam is all about making\
  \ sacrifices and overcoming the self, for others.\n\u201CIt is difficult to fast\
  \ for 19 hours. I engage in a lot of speeches, media, TV and public debating. Fasting\
  \ is a sacrifice and this is a month of charity. And this is my humility. I know\
  \ a lot of people in London are hungry. 100,000 people last year used a food bank.\
  \ So fasting allows me to have solidarity with these hungry, poor people.\n\u201C\
  There is a reason fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. If you're a Muslim,\
  \ and you can fast, then that's great. Another positive thing is that non-Muslims\
  \ are now learning about Islam, about fasting. They ask me \u201Chow are you doing\
  \ this? How is the fasting going?\" I think this is a good thing that they're beginning\
  \ to understand our religion.\u201D\n\u2018Ignorant Trump needs to understand Islam\u2019\
  \nSadiq Khan condemned US politician Donald Trump for helping extremist groups such\
  \ as Daesh by announcing a ban on all Muslims from entering the United States.\n\
  \u201CExtremists say that western values and Islam is incompatible \u2013 that you\
  \ cannot be a Muslim if you're western. They're both different. Donald Trump is\
  \ saying the same: that you cannot be western if you're a Muslim. He proposed a\
  \ ban on Muslims from entering USA. After my victory, he announced that he'd make\
  \ an exception for Sadiq Khan.\n\u201CMy answer is this: I am not an exception.\
  \ Why are you making an exception for me? There are law-abiding Muslims in England\
  \ and London and Europe and all around the world who want to go America. They're\
  \ peaceful, they're law-abiding. Donald trump is basically doing ISIS' work for\
  \ them by preaching their message of either Westernism or Islam.\u201D\nThe London\
  \ mayor said that Donald Trump was an ignorant man who needed to broaden his horizons\
  \ and understanding of Islam.\n\u201CI say that Trump is an idiot. He doesn\u2019\
  t understand Islam, and it is our duty to make him understand that this is not what\
  \ Muslims or Islam is about. And in America there are Americans who are Muslims\
  \ working and living peacefully.\u201D\nSadiq Khan outlined his plan of dealing\
  \ with extremism by supporting the police and security agencies in effectively tacking\
  \ with this menace and by rooting out hate preaching. He said that the biggest worry\
  \ was that it needed only one terrorist to succeed in his mission of causing mayhem\
  \ and terror. He said the fact that many young Muslims, including many women, went\
  \ to Syria from the UK to join ISIS, was a worry and must be dealt with.\n\u201C\
  It is a big worry. London is a great city. Intervention has to be more resilient\
  \ to this preaching of hate. There is a motive to close down those websites that\
  \ are encouraging people to go astray. There have been moves to closing down certain\
  \ accounts and stopping things which encourage people to join terror groups. So\

text: 'Millions risk malnutrition as CO2 levels climb: study


  Paris: Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the air threaten to sap wheat, rice, and
  other staple grains of valuable nutrients, raising the spectre of mass malnutrition,
  researchers warned Monday.On current trends, higher CO2 concentrations could reduce
  iron, zinc and protein levels in the crops that feed the world by up to 17 percent
  by mid-century, they reported in the journal Nature Climate Change."Hundreds of
  millions of people could become newly deficient in these nutrients, primarily in
  Africa, Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East," lead author Matthew Smith, a
  researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told AFP."These are
  in addition to the billions of people already deficient that could see their condition
  worsen."Protein, along with the minerals iron and zinc, are essential nutrients
  for normal human growth and development.Zinc deficiency affects the immune system
  and makes children, particularly, more vulnerable to malaria, lung infections and
  deadly diarrhoeal diseases.A lack of iron increases the likelihood of mothers dying
  during childbirth, can lower IQ, and causes anaemia, or a drop in red blood cells.Wheat,
  rice and maize together account for roughly 40 percent of protein, zinc and iron
  supply in the diet worldwide.In general, humans get three-fifths of dietary protein,
  four-fifths of iron, and 70 percent of zinc requirements from plants.The global
  food system is also vulnerable to rising temperatures, prolonged drought, and other
  forms of extreme weather driven by climate change, earlier research has shown. Impacts
  include reduced crop yields, heat-stressed livestock, and shifts in the quantity
  and location of commercially-fished ocean species.- Unanticipated impacts -To assess
  how extra CO2 in the atmosphere might impact global health by 2050, Smith and colleague
  Samuel Myers ran models for 225 different food plants grown in 151 countries.If
  humanity continues emitting greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil, and natural
  gas at current levels, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is
  likely to reach 550 parts per million (ppm) by 2050.It is now at just over 400 ppm.The
  team found that nearly two percent of the global population -- an extra 175 million
  people -- could become zinc deficient, and 122 million would no longer get enough
  protein under those conditions.Some 1.4 billion women and children under five would
  probably find their iron intake reduced by four percent or more. Half-a-billion
  in this group risk developing iron deficiency-related disease.India would be hardest
  hit, with some 50 million people suffering a lack of zinc, and 38 million falling
  short of minimum protein requirements, said the team.The numbers of affected people
  would also go up dramatically in China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Kenya and
  other emerging or developing economies."Supplements could temporarily alleviate
  some of the health consequences, but they are not a viable long-term solution,"
  said Smith.Because they are difficult to distribute and do not address the underlying
  cause of malnutrition, vitamins and supplements "should best be seen as a short-term
  medical intervention," he added.More than two billion people worldwide are deficient
  in one or more nutrient, according the World Health Organization (WHO).'

text: "Cancer on the rise among children in underprivileged areas of Pakistan\nKarachi:\
  \ An increasing number of cancer cases are being reported among children from low-income\
  \ localities of Pakistan, as per a study conducted by paediatric oncologists at\
  \ the National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Karachi, which cites adverse environmental\
  \ conditions, unhygienic living conditions, consumption of unsafe drinking water\
  \ and malnourishment as possible causes.\_\n\u201CPoor quality of life due to deteriorating\
  \ environmental conditions and unhygienic lifestyle is causing frequent infections\
  \ to a vast majority of Pakistani children. Combined with the malnourishment, these\
  \ infections are resulting in causing various types of cancers to children,\u201D\
  \ said Professor Nizam-ul-Hassan, former director NICH and president of the Child\
  \ Aid Foundation (CAA), a non-profit organisation which runs the cancer treatment\
  \ at the NICH with doctors and philanthropists.\nTalking to The News, he said there\
  \ was no public sector cancer treatment facility in Karachi or even in the entire\
  \ Sindh and Balochistan, and the whole burden of cancer treatment was borne by NGOs\
  \ and associations like the CAA, the Children Cancer Hospital and some other private\
  \ hospitals, including the Aga Khan University Hospital.\nAccording to him, a group\
  \ of Pakistani doctors, including NICH former director Prof Nizamul Hasan, started\
  \ the cancer treatment at the Children Hospital Karachi in April 1999 and since\
  \ then thousands of cancer patients have completely been cured by the qualified\
  \ and trained oncologists and paramedics.\n\u201CAround 50 to 60 children suffering\
  \ from cancers are brought at our OPD everyday, of which 50 percent are new patients.\
  \ Around 300 patients are receiving chemotherapy with various types of cancers,\
  \ including Retinoblastomas, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemias and Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas\u201D\
  , he claimed, adding that the inpatient capacity of the facility was just 14 patients\
  \ due to space constraints.\nWhile quoting pediatric oncologists, he said the worst\
  \ environmental and hygienic conditions at low-income group localities in Pakistan\
  \ were some of the major reasons behind frequent infections, including diarrhea\
  \ and gastroenteritis among children, which was the leading cause of solid tumors\
  \ or blood cancers to them.\nProf Nizam said although the study had yet to be published\
  \ but the observations of the pediatric oncologists led to similar direction, saying\
  \ childhood cancer was on the rise among children of low-income group people, who\
  \ used to live in areas with extremely poor environmental and hygienic conditions,\
  \ having no or low vaccination status and suffered infections on multiple occasions\
  \ in a short span of time.\nTo a query, he said the centre had a team of pediatric\
  \ oncologists, led by Dr Uzma Imam and paramedical staff, who had been trained by\
  \ German pediatric oncologists and paramedics in 2005-06, adding that renowned Pakistani\
  \ pediatric oncologists practicing in US and UK often visit their centre and offered\
  \ their assistance and advice in treatment of patients.\n\u2018Malnourished patients\u2019\
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\n\u201CDuring the last several years, almost 40 percent children brought\
  \ to the NICH with various types of cancers were malnourished and due to low immunity,\
  \ their chances of having cancer increased\u201D, Prof Nizam further said.\nIn addition\
  \ to fighting cancer, he said, doctors and paramedics had to take care of the nutritional\
  \ status of the patients so that their bodies could fight the lethal disease like\
  \ cancers.\nHe further said malnourishment was on the rise among children of low-income\
  \ segments and it was resulting in spreading cancer and other lethal infections.\n\
  \u201CA group of German doctors and nurses, who trained our staff, emphasised on\
  \ improving nutritional status of children with cancers, since a child could not\
  \ fight cancer without having enough nutrition.\u201D\nThe professor said the centre\
  \ was providing highly enriched food supplements in addition to milk and dates to\
  \ cancer patients as most of the patients suffering from cancers were highly fragile\
  \ and underweight due to malnourishment.\n\u2018Eye cancers on the rise\u2019\n\
  Eye cancers, also known as retinoblastomas, are on the rise among Pakistani children\
  \ being brought from rural parts of Sindh, Balochistan and lower Punjab, according\
  \ to Prof Nizam claimed.\nHe said doctors were trying to understand the sudden rise\
  \ in eye cancers which render the patient blind at an early age if not treated at\
  \ the early stages.\nHe said the most common causes of the eye cancers were due\
  \ to genetic reasons, but because of\_ sudden increase in the number of children\
  \ with retinoblastomas, experts at the cancer treatment facility were worried and\
  \ trying to understand the phenomenon.\n\u2018Short of space at centre\u2019\nDespite\
  \ spending Rs600 million annually, the cancer treatment facility at the NICH caters\
  \ to only a few thousand patients annually as only 300 can be given chemotherapy,\
  \ while only 14 can be admitted at the center at a time, according to Prof Nizam\
  \ said.\n\u201CWe are facing a shortage of space due to growing number of patients\
  \ being brought to them from across the country.\n\u201CWe are ready to generate\
  \ double the amount we are spending currently on treatment of children if we are\
  \ provided with ample space to admit more patients. A building at the NICH back\
  \ was supposed to be given to us after its completion, but even after passage of\
  \ a decade, it has not yet been constructed, even after the devolution process\u201D\
  , he said.\nHe urged the provincial government to release funds for the construction\
  \ of the building at the NICH so that more patients with cancers could be treated."

  \  Islamabad Justice Athar Minallah of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) here Wednesday\
  \ issued notices to the respondents after a petitioner challenged the increase in\
  \ unaccounted for gas (UFG) benchmark from 4.5 to 9 per cent that as per petitioner\
  \ will cause huge loss to the public of Pakistan. The petitioner, Farrukh Dall advocate\
  \ has cited federation of Pakistan through secretary cabinet division, ministry\
  \ of  petroleum  and natural  resources, ministry of finance and oil & gas regulatory\
  \ authority (OGRA) as respondents. IHC bench issuing notices to the above said respondents\
  \ also issued notices to the attorney general of Pakistan seeking comments within\
  \ fortnight. The petitioner said that the Constitution of Pakistan is not silent\
  \ on issues which affect economic life of the nation and its citizens. The Constitution\
  \ contains a whole range of articles 3, 4 and 5(2) 9, 14, 18, 23 and 24 which have\
  \ a direct nexus with good economic governance and fundamental rights.   \u201C\
  That the UFG benchmark of 4.5% was fixed by Ogra for Sui Northern Gas Pipelines\
  \ Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) for fiscal year 2011-12 to\
  \ 2014-15 whereas through an illegal decision petroleum ministry and Ogra are trying\
  \ to increase UFG benchmark from 4.5 per cent to 9 per cent on the pretext of non-consumers\
  \ \u2018gas theft, law and order situation and bulk/retail ratio which is illegal/unlawful\
  \ act on their part. This is being done by them despite Prime Minister's deferment\
  \ for change in the gas pricing mechanism that is estimated to increase consumers\
  \ tariff significantly,\u201D he said. The combined impact to the consumers would\
  \ be Rs65-70 billion if the decision is implemented. In fact 4.5 per cent UFG benchmark\
  \ fixed by Ogra in the consumer tariff was meant to reasonably cover the cost of\
  \ pilferage, leakage, loss in security situation and all other difficulties. The\
  \ petitioner argued that petroleum ministry and ECC was not legally empowered to\
  \ issue policy guidelines on UFG and provision of doubt debts in the first place\
  \ as it is a direct jurisdiction of Ogra, which it has been exercising since its\
  \ inception in 2002. The government and regulator are obligated to launch the campaign\
  \ against gas theft rather passing the theft of gas to the consumers. The petitioner\
  \ said that the Supreme Court of Pakistan through a November 25, 2011 judgment had\
  \ shown serious concern  on high  UFG of 11 per cent on SNGPL system and 9.5 per\
  \ cent on SSGCL system and  also referred the matter of increasing UFG benchmark\
  \ from 5 per cent to 7 per cent  for year 2009-2010 to NAB for investigation. The\
  \ petitioner further argued that rectification of gas leakages is the core responsibility\
  \ of the company to which any negligence is not entertainable as gas leakages are\
  \ clearly as controllable factor. Theft of gas has contributed towards increase\
  \ of UFG but the same should have been curtailed after the promulgation of Criminal\
  \ Amendment Act, 2011.  The petitioner has prayed to the IHC to declare the increase\
  \ in UFG illegal and unlawful."

text: "NA-123 faces civic problems, upsurge in crime\n                           \
  \ LAHORESLACKNESS on part of civic bodies as well as police has added to the woes\
  \ of the people living in different areas falling under NA-123, Lahore VI, which\
  \ proved a PML-N stronghold in the last general elections. The poor performance\
  \ of Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) and Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC)\
  \ in their respective domains as well as the alarming increase in the street crime\
  \ and failure of police in curbing it are the two core issues confronted by the\
  \ people of NA-123, Lahore VI. Besides, other issues which need immediate attention,\
  \ according the local population include streets inundated due to rains, heavily\
  \ encroached main roads and routine traffic mess mainly due to the absence of traffic\
  \ wardens. Keeping in view the last general election results, NA-123, Lahore VI\
  \ can rightly be called a PML-N bastion as its ticket-holder Pervaiz Malik emerged\
  \ victorious by getting more than 120,000 votes. The votes bagged by the PML-N candidate\
  \ on this seat were more than the party head Nawaz Sharif, who could get around\
  \ 92,000 votes from NA-120. However, the local people believe that justice wasn\u2019\
  t done to them according to the level of confidence they had shown into the party.\
  \ The provincial constituencies falling under NA-123 are PP-143 and PP-144 where\
  \ Chaudhry Shahbaz Ahmed and Bau Akhter are sitting MPAs. Shahbaz has returned for\
  \ his second term and he is also the Vice Chairman of WASA. The major areas falling\
  \ in this constituency include a big portion of Shadbagh (rest falls in NA-119)\
  \ comprised of Amir Road, Bhamman and Jhuggian Villages, Bhagatpura, China Scheme,\
  \ Gujjarpura, Alya Town, Shawala Chowk, Janipura, Ghoray Shah, ample portion of\
  \ GT Road near Baghbanpura. Most of the development in the area took place after\
  \ the Local Government polls of 2001 and 2005. Most of the areas of NA-123, particularly\
  \ pertaining to China Scheme and Gujjarpura side are a picture of neglect, which\
  \ local people believe is due to multiple reasons such as apathy of the elected\
  \ representatives, poor performance of the government bodies and above all, the\
  \ absence of local bodies which could well tackle the issues like past. The survey\
  \ conducted in the constituency found that most of the open grounds had turned into\
  \ dumping ground and local people complained that not a single time, any staffer\
  \ of LWMC bothered to remove filth. What has added to the troubles of the local\
  \ population is stagnant water in the open areas, which has become a permanent breeding\
  \ ground for mosquitoes, which not necessarily cause dengue, but could cause malaria\
  \ outbreak.A group of students while talking to The News complained that they were\
  \ yet to see the elected representatives in their areas and due to their lack of\
  \ concern, the officials from different departments never pay attention towards\
  \ these areas. A ground, just in front of a well-known girls college in China Scheme,\
  \ near the drain is filled with fresh water and is a breeding place for dengue mosquito,\
  \ which has played havoc with hundreds of lives during last six to eight years in\
  \ Lahore, remained unchecked. Imran, one of the boys who have turned up to play\
  \ cricket there told The News that not only in this particular area, even in many\
  \ adjacent parts, filth had become a common sight but there had been no measures\
  \ to remove it. However, the people have also taken a sigh of relief over the repair\
  \ work being carried out on the Shadbagh-China Scheme drain, which is more than\
  \ 3km long and whose boundary wall at different points had been broken and posing\
  \ serious life risk to commuters. The boundary wall of this drain had been raised\
  \ from different sides and at some points, even more than 40 feet area of the wall\
  \ washed away by the rains in September. On most of the occasions, attention of\
  \ the relevant quarters was drawn through different sources to build the boundary\
  \ wall of the drain which could prove hazardous in case any bus or vehicle carrying\
  \ passengers falls into it. Local people stated that number of times, motorcyclists\
  \ had fallen into the drain and faced serious injuries and now after local MNA Pervaiz\
  \ Malik and MPA Chaudhry Shahbaz took notice, the repair work has been started.\
  \ Local people told The News that even before the September rains which caused huge\
  \ loss to the wall of the drain, most of the its points were damaged which also\
  \ resulted in accidents and were an open death trap. Besides, a positive development\
  \ in the area is regarding the condition of public parks which have improved as\
  \ compared to past, when most of them were not only a picture of neglect, but also\
  \ safe havens for drug addicts in the evening.Apart from a boys college, the Punjab\
  \ government has also set up a degree college for women in the area and local people\
  \ hailed this initiative. Shaista Pervaiz Malik, wife of the sitting MNA Pervaiz\
  \ Malik and herself an MNA on seats reserved for women also seem active in party\
  \ affairs in the constituency.Street crimeStreet crime is another prime matter of\
  \ concern for most of the local people who said that in the area of Shadbagh, particularly\
  \ near Amir Road, Bhagatpura, Pir Ronki Park needed proper police attention. The\
  \ area of NA-123, particularly falling mostly under PP-143 is the precinct of two\
  \ police stations, including Shadbagh and Gujjarpura. One of it, Shadbagh falls\
  \ in City Division which is headed by SP Asad Sarfaraz Khan. Gujjarpura Police Station\
  \ is the part of Civil Lines Division which is headed by SP Imtiaz Sarwar.Situation\
  \ in Shadbagh witnessed some improvement in the area since the new SP took over\
  \ in June this year, unfortunately, local police failed to ensure proper security\
  \ of citizens later. Only in the month of December, the incidents of bike snatching,\
  \ bike theft, robbery have witnessed a drastic rise as compared to the past months,\
  \ since the new SHO, Sub Inspector Mohammad Raza took over the charge. In the latest\
  \ incident occurring on December 28 (Sunday), Fahad, a student and resident of Chaudhry\
  \ Park, Shadbagh was deprived of his new motorbike by two armed motorcyclists, which\
  \ he had purchased just a night ago. Fahad was just on his way to home and quite\
  \ close to his house, he was intercepted by two armed men who, at gunpoint snatched\
  \ his new motorbike and fled from the scene. According to his family, the emergency\
  \ 15 call was done soon after the incident but it took more than 30 minutes for\
  \ the police team to reach the spot. The FIR of the incident has been registered.\
  \ In the month of December, Fayiz, a student was deprived of his bike in daylight.The\
  \ incident took place near old Wapda office situated close to Akram Park, Shadbagh.\
  \ FIR was registered but so far no progress had been made in the case.Family of\
  \ Fayiz told The News that unknown persons broke into their house last year and\
  \ made away with a bike. So, in 2013 and 2014, the same family had been deprived\
  \ of the vehicles twice. Most of the people in the constituency complained that\
  \ no elected representatives visited them to inquire about their condition. Similarly,\
  \ Sajjad, a trader lost his motorbike which was parked just outside his residence\
  \ on December 17 from Chaudhry Park. However, the incident which exposes the level\
  \ of law and order is related with a robbery which took place on a department store\
  \ owned by a youth named Abdul Qadeer. On December 10, Abdul Qadeer was sitting\
  \ in his store when three unidentified men, at gunpoint robbed him of around Rs30,000\
  \ cash. The incident took place in the evening. What shocks most of the local people\
  \ is the fact that this wasn\u2019t the first incident on this shop, as three persons,\
  \ this year had also deprived the shop owner of his laptop, mobile phones and around\
  \ Rs90,000 in the month of April. At that time, Inspector Kamran Zaman was SHO Shadbagh\
  \ whereas Imtiaz Sarwar was in-charge of the City Division. The shop owner time\
  \ and again visited the police station but no official paid any heed towards his\
  \ complaint and this time, having faced another robbery, the heartbroken citizen\
  \ didn\u2019t visit the police station. When contacted, Abdul Qadeer stated that\
  \ in the same year, he had been robbed twice but not a single police official visited\
  \ his shop to probe the incident, although the police station was situated just\
  \ a few yards away from his store. Sufyan and Hamza, two brothers who run a mobile\
  \ shop, in the front lane of Qadeer\u2019s store at Amir Road, have also been looted\
  \ by a two dacoits who, after entering the shop snatched cash from a salesman and\
  \ after threatening of dire consequences, left the shop while drawing its shutter\
  \ down a couple of months ago.In the same week, Shaukat Ali, a resident of Gujjarpura\
  \ on his way to home was deprived of around Rs100,000 cash, ATM cards and other\
  \ documents by unidentified armed persons near Ilahi Town. Due to lack of police\
  \ patrolling, the incident of car mirror theft have also become a routine in the\
  \ area. Javed, a resident of Ferozepark, told The News that since 2011, more than\
  \ 10 times, the mirror of his car had been stolen by unknown persons but only verbal\
  \ assurances were given to him by the police. Within last three months, Javed lost\
  \ side mirrors of his car at night and according to him, the price of a new pair\
  \ is around Rs20,000 but, he had now started buying second hand sets which are not\
  \ less than Rs15,000. Sikander Khan, another resident, and a travel agent by profession\
  \ was deprived of cash, mobile phones and laptop by unknown armed persons in September\
  \ this year just outside his residence, when he was coming back from work. In the\
  \ very next street, unknown persons made away with a sacrificial bull, worth Rs0.1\
  \ million from Ferozepark, just a few days before Eidul Azha. The bull belonged\
  \ to Syed Farooq Iftikhar, a local resident who had tied it just outside his house.\
  \ In all the above cases, so far the victims said that no progress had been made.In\
  \ the area of Chaudhry Park, a few hundred yards from police station, number of\
  \ incidents had occurred and people seemed greatly perturbed due to police failure\
  \ in curbing such occurrences. The ring road underpass, which is a link between\
  \ rest of Shadbagh and Ring Road, near Pir Ronqi graveyard has become a risky area\
  \ for most of the persons. Naeem, a businessman, was also deprived of cash, mobile\
  \ sets and other valuables a few months ago. The local police officials claimed\
  \ that they were making the all-out effort to curb crime and nab the criminals.\
  \ SHO of Shadbagh Police Station Mohammad Raza stated that police lacked proper\
  \ wireless system and patrolling vehicles which had been taken back by the authorities.\
  \ There was a dire need to facilitate police, recruit more contingents so that they\
  \ could take proper care of this big area. Asad Sarfaraz, SP of City Division told\
  \ The News that situation in his division was \u2018under control\u2019 and police\
  \ had busted gangs and recovered looted material from them. He said in winter, the\
  \ wave of crime increased but at the same time, police was committed to eliminate\
  \ crime. In the area of Gujjarpura, local people expressed dissatisfaction over\
  \ the police role in curbing street crimes. However, Qamar Abbas, the local SHO\
  \ when contacted said the all-out effort had been made to control crime in the area.\
  \ He said street crime was an international issue. He said there had been complaints\
  \ in the past but situation was improving now and number of street crime incidents\
  \ had come down. Imtiaz Sarwar, SP Civil Lines Division when contacted said the\
  \ police teams had been assigned duties in their respective areas to maintain peace.\
  \ He said all the required measures had been taken to ensure security of the citizens.Traffic\
  \ and encroachments: Traffic mess has also become a routine in most parts of the\
  \ constituency which included Amir Road, Shadbagh-China Scheme drain road, Sher\
  \ Shah Road but traffic wardens are seen seldom in these parts. Moreover, major\
  \ roads, including ample portion of GT Road, falling in PP-144 are heavily encroached\
  \ which cause routine traffic mess. The matter had also been taken up in Punjab\
  \ Assembly by the MPA Bau Akhter and another female MPA hailing from the area, Raheela\
  \ Khadim Hussein. However, no action, so far has been taken.Local Representatives\u2019\
  \ views: MNA Pervaiz Malik told The News that there was no denying the fact that\
  \ there were issues which needed solution but at the same time, the PML-N government\
  \ had also left no stone unturned in providing every possible relief to the people.\
  \ He said as an MNA, he was totally connected with the people of his constituency\
  \ and his doors were always open for them. He said PML-N was committed to provide\
  \ maximum relief to the public. Chaudhry Shahbaz Ahmed, the MPA elected from PP-143\
  \ said special focus had been laid to improve the situation of schools, colleges,\
  \ roads but despite all steps, there were always room for improvement. He said the\
  \ government would take all steps to address the complaints of local people regarding\
  \ any department.Bau Akhter, MPA elected from PP-144 while talking to The News stated\
  \ there was no doubt that basic issues concerning public were there in the constituency\
  \ but at the same time, concrete measures had been taken by the government to address\
  \ them. He said in order to address the issue of clean drinking water, the chief\
  \ minister had taken special initiatives. Besides, he said the people in his constituency\
  \ also faced environmental issues due the presence of factories situated in the\
  \ residential areas. However, he said measures were also underway to tackle this\
  \ issue. Regarding law and order, he said shortage of police force was the prime\
  \ cause behind this issue which certainly needed to be addressed. He said presence\
  \ of a local government was necessary in addressing the basic public issues."

text: "Hanif Abbasi claims project to be completed as per schedule\n             \
  \               Islamabad While people of Islamabad have expressed concern over\
  \ slow pace of work being carried out  on Metro Bus Service Project , however, the\
  \ chairman of its implementation subcommittee , Hanif Abbasi vows confidently that\
  \ it would be completed on January 30, 2015. However, he also clarified that Peshawar\
  \ Morr Terminal would take some time for completion. Metro Buses would begin to\
  \ operate immediately on the routes of Islamabad and Rawalpindi after the inauguration\
  \ of the project on January 30, 2015 and all the speculations being aired about\
  \ its delay by people would prove wrong. Elaborating the reasons for delay in completion\
  \ of work on Peshawar Morr Terminal, Hanif Abbasi said that over 9 flyovers, 4 under\
  \ passes and 4 ramps have to be constructed on terminal plan. Moreover, the volume\
  \ of work of MBP of Rawalpindi and Islamabad is 40 per cent more than compared to\
  \ Lahore MBP. On the directions of the Punjab chief minister, work on the project\
  \ has been further expedited for meeting the new deadline. On the other hand, people\
  \ including labourers carrying out work on the project, claimed that there is no\
  \ possibility that it would be completed on new schedule date of January 30, 2015.\
  \ The labourers working in Chandni Chowk and other different project points like\
  \ Rehmanabad and Islamabad on condition of anonymity told this scribe that the project\
  \ is likely to completed in March next year. Giving reasons, they said that there\
  \ is 50 per cent shortage of labourers for such a big project. Those working on\
  \ it, receives only Rs 450 as daily charges, working for more than 12 hours a day.\
  \ \u201COn this daily wage, we have to eat food and tea from our own money and Rs200\
  \ are spent for this purpose each day. A number of middle aged labourers get tired\
  \ during working hours and take almost two hours rest,\u201D they claimed. They\
  \ like other people claimed that work on the project is going on slow note because\
  \ of shortage of 50 per cent staff. If the authorities pay handsome wages then people\
  \ would join as labourers to work on the project, they told. However, replying to\
  \ the claims of the labourers, Hanif Abbasi as well as project director of the MBP,\
  \ Commissioner Zahid Saeed cleared that each labourer is being paid Rs600 as daily\
  \ wages. Those who are receiving Rs450 as claimed by the labourers themselves would\
  \ have been hired by sub contractors who are awarded certain sections of the project.\
  \ However, the chairman assured that he would take up the issue and direct the sub\
  \ contractors for paying the fixed wages of Rs600 to every labourer. Further, Hanif\
  \ Abbasi told that though project was inaugurated on February, however, the first\
  \ contract of it was awarded on March 28, 2014 and work started in mid April. In\
  \ view of this situation, when the project would meet the deadline of January 30,\
  \ then it means only 7 months have been taken in its completion period against the\
  \ 10 months time. The project remained delayed due to political reasons, which is\
  \ Dharnas by PTI and PAT. The sit-in of PTI lasted for 127 days which means four\
  \ months which created hurdle in work on the project in Islamabad section."

text: "Circular debt \u2013 a vicious cycle of unpaid bills\n                    \
  \        A recent report of the central bank said the problems in the energy system\
  \ have worsened as reflected in the persistence of load management and the re-emergence\
  \ of inter-corporate circular debt. Circular debt, - a vicious cycle of unpaid bills\
  \ running through the entire power-generation chain, swollen to nearly 2.0 percent\
  \ of GDP and has threaten the functioning of the energy sector.The government, to\
  \ limit the accumulation of circular debt, imposed a surcharge of Rs 0.30/unit from\
  \ October 2014 following soft crude prices. The adjustment implied an effective\
  \ increase of 2.5 percent in electricity tariffs and the government is planned to\
  \ make more adjustments in January and February 2015 to reduce electricity subsidies\
  \ to 0.7 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year.The current fiscal year started\
  \ on a positive note, when the government settled circular debt of Rs 500 billion\
  \ in June 2013. Furthermore, the Pakistan Muslim League\u2019s government was also\
  \ showed its committed to resolve the root causes for the power crisis. The government\
  \ then vowed to implement a time-bound plan to tackle price distortions; inadequate\
  \ collections; costly and poorly targeted subsidies; governance and regulatory deficiencies;\
  \ and low efficiency in the supply and distribution of energy. Unfortunately, most\
  \ of the needed reforms including privatization of distribution companies; increase\
  \ in household tariffs; price rationalization of CNG; and lower priority to households\
  \ in gas allocations, either could not be initiated, or made very slow progress.\
  \ The demand-supply gap hovered around 4,000 megawatt during the year showed a marked\
  \ deterioration.Qasim Niaz, Chairman IPPs Advisory Committee (IPPAC), said the government\
  \ has made some payments to the power producers to run their plants on maximum capacity\
  \ as hydroelectricity fell in winters. However, the initiative is not a sustainable\
  \ solution.\u201CThe government should avoid delay in payments, which would curtail\
  \ accumulation of circular debt and enable IPPs to run on maximum capacity,\u201D\
  \ Niaz said. Analysts said the vicious cycle of debt once again bogged down energy\
  \ supply chain as power distributors delay payments to generators who, in turn,\
  \ face difficulty in clearing dues of fuel suppliers like Pakistan State Oil.An\
  \ expansive fuel mix is partly blamed for the country\u2019s energy woes. The average\
  \ fuel component of generation cost on furnace oil has increased to Rs19/kilowatt\
  \ hour in 2013 from Rs12 in 2011, while generation cost on coal is around Rs3/unit.Still\
  \ there has been no significant progress made on the coal side. Although, a number\
  \ of power producers announced to convert on coal, none has been able to achieve\
  \ the financial close so far primarily because of the lethargic attitude of National\
  \ Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).\u201CVested interest groups mainly\
  \ the infamous oil mafia in the country, keep bringing up frivolous points against\
  \ coal, which is costing $700,000/day to consumers of Karachi,\u201D an official\
  \ of an IPP intending to convert on coal said. \u201CRunning 420 megawatts plant\
  \ on furnace oil costs $500 million a year and it would cost less than $250 million\
  \ on coal.\u201D\u201CThe addiction to oil is set to be replaced by addiction to\
  \ natural gas/LNG. LNG is better than oil but still more expensive than coal,\u201D\
  \ he said.The central bank report said energy conservation must be promoted to manage\
  \ the demand-supply gap in the short-run along with supply initiatives to find a\
  \ long-term solution of the issue. On the demand side, no policy initiative was\
  \ implemented to rationalize power consumption.The government though increased tariffs\
  \ in October; it was more focused on commercial and industries users, compared to\
  \ household users who are less productive from an economic point of view. Given\
  \ the need to rebalance power consumption between productive and non-productive\
  \ users, these tariff revisions could have been better targeted, the central bank\
  \ said.The bank believes that without bringing the consumption mix to a more optimum\
  \ level, the likelihood of exiting the ongoing power crisis is not promising.\u201C\
  Both natural gas and electricity tariffs for households need to be rationalized\
  \ to encourage households to invest in more efficient appliances and reduce wastage.\
  \ Ultimately, sustainable economic development will depend on changing the mindset\
  \ that cheap energy is a right, with a culture that encourages conservation and\
  \ productive usage,\u201D the bank said in its report.The IMF, in its December review,\
  \ notes that the supply shortages stem from a lack of sufficient installed capacity\
  \ to cover peak demand but also from the inability to keep installed plants running\
  \ at peak output due to shortages of gas and of money to provide sufficient fuel\
  \ oil in expensive oil-fired plants.\u201CThere are also significant line losses\
  \ in the distribution system due to inefficiencies and theft,\u201D IMF said.The\

text: "Mutual legal assistance law to help block terror financing\n              \
  \              IslamabadIn a bid to curb terrorist financing, Pakistan will have\
  \ to enact Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) law with the approval of Parliament and\
  \ synchronise legal mechanism at provincial levels for tracking down financiers\
  \ of terror groups. \"Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi was released by the court mainly because\
  \ neither Pakistan nor India put MLA in place so the dossier sent out by New Delhi\
  \ to Islamabad could not be held admissible as evidence before the court of law,\"\
  \ former caretaker law minister and expert on international law Bilal Ahmer Sufi\
  \ told reporters here on Tuesday. MLA, he said, was in place in UK and in many other\
  \ western countries. The military operation is just one aspect, which could be termed\
  \ as surgery but the government would have to put in place legal framework to move\
  \ ahead on blocking terror financing. He said the provincial governments would have\
  \ to enact laws in order to place effective mechanism on all those fronts where\
  \ powers were devolved under 18th constitutional amendment. A mutual legal assistance\
  \ treaty (MLAT) is an agreement between two or more countries for the purpose of\
  \ gathering and exchanging information in an effort to enforce public criminal laws.\
  \ The modern states have developed mechanisms for requesting and obtaining evidence\
  \ for criminal investigations and prosecutions. When evidence or other forms of\
  \ legal assistance, such as witnesses' statements or the service of documents are\
  \ needed from a foreign sovereign, states may attempt to cooperate informally through\
  \ their respective police agencies or, alternatively, resort to what is typically\
  \ referred to as requests for \"mutual legal assistance\". The practice of mutual\
  \ legal assistance developed from the comity-based system of letters rogatory, though\
  \ it is now far more common for states to make mutual legal assistance requests\
  \ directly to the designated \"Central Authorities\" within each state. In contemporary\
  \ practice, such requests may still be made on the basis of reciprocity but may\
  \ also be made pursuant to bilateral and multilateral treaties that obligate countries\
  \ to provide assistance. This assistance may take the form of examining and identifying\
  \ people, places and things, custodial transfers, and providing assistance with\
  \ the immobilisation of the instruments of criminal activity. With regard to the\
  \ latter, MLATs between the United States and Caribbean nations do not cover U.S.\
  \ tax evasion, and are therefore ineffective when applied to Caribbean countries,\
  \ which usually act as offshore tax havens. Assistance may be denied by either country\
  \ (according to agreement details) for political or security reasons, or if the\
  \ criminal offence in question is not equally punishable in both countries. Some\
  \ treaties may encourage assistance with legal aid for nationals in other countries.\
  \ Under the initiative of United Nations to counter terrorism, member states are\
  \ negotiating an additional international treaty, a draft comprehensive convention\
  \ on international terrorism. This convention would complement the existing framework\
  \ of international anti-terrorism instruments and would build on key guiding principles\
  \ already present in recent anti-terrorist conventions: the importance of criminalisation\
  \ of terrorist offences, making them punishable by law and calling for prosecution\
  \ or extradition of the perpetrators; the need to eliminate legislation which establishes\
  \ exceptions to such criminalisation on political, philosophical, ideological, racial,\
  \ ethnic, religious or similar grounds; a strong call for member states to take\
  \ action to prevent terrorist acts; and emphasis on the need for member states to\
  \ cooperate, exchange information and provide each other with the greatest measure\
  \ of assistance in connection with the prevention, investigation and prosecution\
  \ of terrorist acts."

  \ to initiate dialogue with the parliamentary parties to remove their reservations.The\
  \ PML-N leader said that some parties are unnecessarily trying to create controversies\
  \ about the creation of the military courts although all of them had agreed to the\

  In Tuesday\u2019s meeting of constitutional experts belonging to different parties,\
  \ the PPP rejected the comprehensive constitutional amendment prepared by the attorney\
  \ general. Instead PPP representative Aitzaz Ahsan presented a brief modification\
  \ in an ordinary law to establish military courts and held the view that there was\
  \ no need of constitutional amendment for the purpose. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\
  \ (PTI) nominee Hamid Khan had dismissed the proposal of setting up military courts\
  \ altogether although his chief Imran Khan had consented to it in the December 24\
  \ meeting.In the National Assembly, the PML-N has a total of 189 seats apart from\
  \ the support of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl, National Party, Federally Administered\
  \ Tribal Areas (Fata) members and some smaller groups. However, when Nawaz Sharif\
  \ was elected as prime minister in 2013, he had clinched sixteen votes more than\
  \ the dreamy two-thirds majority. The two-thirds figure precisely comes to 228 MPs\
  \ while Nawaz Sharif had secured 244 votes.The PML-N has only 14 senators - 13 from\

  \ With the addition of one member each of the National Party of Hasil Bizenjo and\
  \ Balochistan Chief Minister Dr Abdul Malik, and PML-Functional, the ruling coalition\u2019\

  \ uncomfortable with the Senate for not having majority in it. It cherishes a previous\
  \ record of fast legislation but it has not been able to keep that up during its\
  \ present stint due to its poor numerical position in the Senate. It was for this\

text: "New drug pricing policy: will it really purge the system of discretion?\n \
  \                           Islamabad The final draft of the new drug pricing policy\
  \ only awaits the Prime Minister\u2019s approval now. While official sources are\
  \ widely praising the policy for offering a comprehensive pricing formula that will\
  \ purge the system of discretion, and for recommending a freeze on prices of drugs\
  \ till June 2016 (at levels of 2013), independent analysts are expressing serious\
  \ reservations about what the policy will eventually entail. \u201CThe role of officials\
  \ in determining or revising the prices of drugs has been done away with. There\
  \ shall be no interaction with officials in matters of price revision. The policy\
  \ not only provides a clear formula under which drug prices would be regulated,\
  \ but also supports that the prices of drugs be frozen till June 2016 at levels\
  \ of 2013, whereafter the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shall be applied,\u201D official\
  \ sources privy to the development confided. What sounds good, at least on the face\
  \ of it, is not all that rosy when seen from the lens of public health experts and\
  \ pharmaceutical sector specialists.  Dr. Sania Nishtar, an internationally acclaimed\
  \ health expert who has independently authored numerous health policy documents\
  \ and action plans, and who is also the founder president of Heartfile, believes\
  \ \u201Cthere is a need to critically review the policy parameters currently outlined\
  \ in the draft policy, which is in the public domain.\u201D  Dr. Sania pointed out\
  \ that \u201CWhilst the current iteration of the drug pricing policy intends to\
  \ purge the system of discretion, it may inadvertently end up doing exactly the\
  \ opposite, since withdrawal of SRO 1002 and mandatory price reductions will lead\
  \ most manufacturers to try and come under the \u2018hardship\u2019 policy umbrella\
  \ and apply to the regulator for exceptions. Far from \u2018purging the system of\
  \ discretion\u2019 as claimed in the title of the policy, this strengthens the regulator\u2019\
  s discretionary role.\u201D Dr. Sania emphasised that price regulation is a very\
  \ tricky and complicated area. As described by her in her book, \u2018Choked Pipes,\u2019\
  \ \u201CThe agenda of price regulation is subject to conflicting political interests\
  \ and lobbying by strong interest groups in the pharmaceutical sector in an environment\
  \ of weak regulation and endemic collusion.\u201D Dr. Sania further states in the\
  \ book that, \u201CIn order to achieve the objective of affordable prices of essential\
  \ medicines, a review of available options is critically important.\u201D On the\
  \ other hand, public health pharmacist Ayyaz Kiani, who is also editor of the \u2018\
  Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice,\u2019 published by BioMed Central,\
  \ UK, thinks it is a good policy for three reasons. \u201CFirstly, it intends to\
  \ remove discretionary powers of the regulators, which is a good step, at least\
  \ in intention, as much will depend on how this policy will be implemented. Secondly,\
  \ the policy makes price increase painless for the industry as they may now follow\
  \ the formula and increase prices annually on their own without having to go through\
  \ cumbersome procedures with DRAP. And thirdly, because there is ample emphasis\
  \ on protecting public interest by giving priority to addressing public health issues.\u201D\
  \ The draft policy is stated to have been finalised by the Policy Board of the Drug\
  \ Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) after inputs from various stakeholder\
  \ organisations namely, the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, Pharma\
  \ Bureau, Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, and public sector stakeholders\
  \ including ministries of Commerce, Industries and Finance, and Board of Investment.\
  \ Ayyaz regretted that no input on the important policy has been sought from the\
  \ civil society or consumer advocates. \u201CMoreover, whatever consultation was\
  \ done with the industry did not help as their point of view has been sidelined;\
  \ they are up in arms against it, and have gone to court. These industry representatives\
  \ strongly disagree with the pricing policy. Such confrontation should have been\
  \ avoided. Regulators cannot expect to regulate a sector intent on failing them.\
  \ It has to be a win-win situation for stakeholders for a public policy to successfully\
  \ deliver the envisaged benefits,\u201D he stated when asked for comments. Commenting\
  \ on prices of drugs being frozen till June 2016 (at levels of 2013), Ayyaz said,\
  \ \u201CThere is no justification for this drastic step, which has been strongly\
  \ contested by the pharmaceutical industry as being too harsh and punitive without\
  \ justification. Personally, I think such retrospective implementation is bad policy,\u201D\
  \ he was of the view. Official sources believe the new policy aims to ensure availability\
  \ of quality drugs at affordable prices to patients on the one hand, and to keep\
  \ the industry viable, ensuring its growth and promoting investment in the country,\
  \ on the other.  Ayyaz viewed this claim with skepticism. \u201CThe industry does\
  \ not think such an objective is being served through this policy; they believe\
  \ it is \u2018disabling\u2019 rather than \u2018enabling\u2019 growth and further\
  \ investment in the sector. The pharma industry (especially its foreign investment\
  \ component) has indeed been lately disinvesting, and prospects of growth already\
  \ seem remote,\u201D he flagged.  Sharing the key features of the drug pricing policy,\
  \ sources confided that drugs have been divided into two categories in terms of\
  \ pricing. The first category, that of scheduled drugs, includes most commonly used\
  \ top 50 drugs, drugs on essential list, drugs for treatment of Cancer, TB, Hepatitis,\
  \ HIV, Thalassaemia and Organ Transplant, biological and new chemical entities.\
  \ In the second category, which is that of non-scheduled drugs, the prices of drugs\
  \ not coming under the scheduled category shall be \u2018partially\u2019 regulated\
  \ in terms of pricing. Commenting on this categorization, Ayyaz said, the top 50\
  \ used drugs is not a good point to start as many non-essential and indeed irrational\
  \ drugs exist in this category, and as such, protecting this group of medicines\
  \ through higher level of control will be counterproductive. \u201CAll the others\
  \ categories in this list have clear public health importance and have been correctly\
  \ prioritized for protection,\u201D he added.  With reference to price fixation\
  \ of new chemical entities (NCEs), the policy document states that price fixation\
  \ of originator brand of NCE shall be based on average price of the same brand in\
  \ India and Bangladesh. If originator brand of NCE has not been marketed in India\
  \ or Bangladesh, its maximum retail price shall be fixed equal to the lowest of\
  \ the following, namely: 1) retail price in developing countries which regulate\
  \ drug prices; 2) whole sale price of in UK Monthly Index of Medical Supplies or\
  \ British National Formulary or Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or New\
  \ Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency. The document also states that the prices\
  \ of generic substitutes of the NCE shall be fixed @ 30% less than the originator\
  \ brand price. Sharing his views, Ayyaz pointed out that all of the above clauses\
  \ depend too much on what goes in other countries, and reflect Pakistani regulators\u2019\
  \ inability to adjudicate prices in Pakistan. The policy also contains a clause\
  \ for price reduction after recovery of research cost, sources claimed. To this\
  \ effect, the document mentions that \u201Cprices of originator brands of new chemical\
  \ entities will be reduced by 30% after 5 years of its registration or when 3 or\
  \ more me-toos/biosimilars have been marketed, whichever is earlier. Ayyaz termed\
  \ this as a good step but emphasized the need for \u201Cclarity on what would be\
  \ the base for calculation of the reduction: whether the starting price or the one\
  \ at the end of the 5th year?\u201D As for increase in prices of drugs, the policy\
  \ stipulates that effective July 1, 2016, annual increase shall be linked with CPI\
  \ of the immediately preceding financial year. \u201CManufacturers and importers\
  \ may increase their existing maximum retail prices of scheduled drugs up to 50%\
  \ of CPI (with a cap of 4%) and maximum retail prices of non-scheduled drugs up\
  \ to 70% of CPI (with a cap of 6%) once in any financial year. The calculation of\
  \ revised maximum retail price shall be intimated to the Authority (Division of\
  \ Costing and Pricing) at least 15 days prior to affecting the increase. Non-intimation\
  \ of prices shall be construed as non-revision of maximum retail prices. The failure\
  \ to intimate the increase in price shall tantamount to nullifying the price increase,\u201D\
  \ sources shared. In order to encourage the production of lower-priced drugs, the\
  \ policy states that drugs whose prices are less than Rs. 2 per tablet/capsule,\
  \ Rs. 2 per 5ml of syrup, Rs. 2 per 1 gm of cream/ointment/gel, Rs. 2 per patch,\
  \ Rs. 4 per sachet, and Rs. 10 per injection shall be deemed to be non-scheduled\
  \ drugs.  Similarly, locally manufactured products approved for export to developed\
  \ countries like USA, UK, EU countries, Japan, Australia or WHO shall be exempted\
  \ from price control in the local market to encourage manufacturing and export of\
  \ quality drugs, subject to the conditions that FOB price for export is not less\
  \ than the ex-factory price in the country. \u201CThis is totally unacceptable as\
  \ a small amount of export of a product would exempt it totally for domestic price\
  \ control. This one clause, in fact, nullifies all the public health benefits of\
  \ regulation through this price,\u201D Ayyaz pointed out.  The policy document also\
  \ states that a procedure shall be devised by the Policy Board to review maximum\
  \ retail prices of drugs which have become non-viable to market. Prices will be\
  \ fixed on the basis of competitive manufacturing cost and will be uniform for all\
  \ companies. \u201CThis will help boost availability of low-priced essential medicines\
  \ which has been a protracted problem in the market. Kudos for this,\u201D Ayyaz\
  \ remarked. The Policy Board has also decided to make amendments in the law so that\
  \ overcharged amounts by the industry/hospital/ retailer plus penalty @ 20% per\
  \ annum will be deposited in the government treasury. Ayyaz said, \u201CThis too\
  \ is a commendable step but will need muscle to implement, which the regulators\
  \ have traditionally lacked.\u201D So before the PM puts his signature on the final\
  \ draft of the drug pricing policy, a review of issues being flagged by independent\
  \ health analysts may help achieve better outcomes in the long run."

text: "2014 darkest year in terms of polio eradication\n                         \
  \   ISLAMABAD: The year 2014 was one of the darkest years in terms of polio eradication\
  \ in Pakistan with around 300 polio cases, highest in last 16 years, and killing\
  \ of dozens of polio workers across the country but the government is hopeful that\
  \ its National Action Plan against terrorism would also help the country in defeating\
  \ polio.Also in 2014, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it mandatory\
  \ for Pakistanis travelling abroad to receive at least one dose of anti-polio vaccine,\
  \ since the country was accused of exporting the virus to other regions. According\
  \ to the UN health body, Pakistan accounts for 94% of the world polio cases while\
  \ the country has recorded a 300 percent increase in these cases during 2014 from\
  \ 93 to 295 so far while hundreds of samples are still being tested in National\
  \ Institute of Health (NIH). Nigeria and Afghanistan are the only two other countries\
  \ with endemic polio but both have recorded decrease in polio cases in 2014. Nigeria\
  \ recorded 450% decrease in polio cases last year as the number went down from 50\
  \ to 12.Pakistani health official claims that polio has largely become a security\
  \ related issue as 85 percent of the polio cases have been reported from security\
  \ compromised areas where vaccination teams cannot immunise the children owing to\
  \ fear of attacks. According to official figures 74 polio workers have been killed\
  \ so far in Pakistan since 2012.An official working with polio eradication programme\
  \ said it was a massive communication failure on the part of the authorities as\
  \ around 50,000 families have refused to vaccinate their children against polio\
  \ owing to doubts about the programme despite huge media campaign by the government\
  \ and Unicef. He said 50,000 is recorded figure of refusal cases while rough estimates\
  \ suggest that over 150,000 families have refused polio vaccination, but the polio\
  \ teams are reluctant to record these refusal cases as it would indicate their power\
  \ performance.\u201CIt is a communication failure as almost all segments of society\
  \ have doubts or concerns about polio vaccine,\u201D said a top official with polio\
  \ eradication programme requesting anonymity.He said upper class has doubts about\
  \ polio workers\u2019 hygiene and quality of the vaccine so they may opt for private\
  \ vaccination. The middle class is angry with government\u2019s lack of focus on\
  \ development and other health needs of people so they doubt why polio is given\
  \ priority, he said adding that lower class think polio vaccine is a conspiracy\
  \ against Muslims hatched by West to reduce the population of Muslims. They also\
  \ cite the example of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) spy Shakeel Afridi who used\
  \ a fake polio campaign to trace Osama Bin Laden in Abbotabad.The official said\
  \ the authorities have failed to devise an effective communication strategy to convince\
  \ all three segments of society about the need, utility and efficacy of polio vaccine.\u201C\
  Ulema have been used on TV advertisements to support polio vaccination, but a large\
  \ number of people who refuse polio vaccine on religious grounds do not watch TV\
  \ at all. There is a need of localized communication strategies with cultural consideration\
  \ of each area to effectively eliminate doubts about polio programme,\u201D the\
  \ official said.He said Unicef is brining foreign communication experts to devise\
  \ communication plan for the rural areas of Pakistan, but these experts are not\
  \ aware of indigenous culture.However, when contacted by The News, the head of Prime\
  \ Minister\u2019s Polio Monitoring and Coordination Cell, Ayesha Farooq, said the\
  \ government has re-devised its strategy against polio which will show results in\
  \ next few months.She said the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has expressed personal\
  \ resolve to eliminate polio from the country and drastic measures have been taken\
  \ during last few months in this regard.She said 85 percent cases of polio have\
  \ been recorded in security compromised areas of Waziristan, Khyber Agency, Peshawar\
  \ and Karachi.\u201CAs many as 241 polio cases (81.7 percent) were reported this\
  \ year from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Fata which indicates a direct correlation between\
  \ incidence of polio cases and access issues due to security,\u201D she said.Ayesha\
  \ Farooq, who is also the legislator of ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), said\
  \ innovative measures have been taken by the government with the involvements of\
  \ provinces.\u201CRoutine immunisation will also be increased as a part of new strategy.\
  \ Media is being used to spread the message, and the help of parliamentarians and\
  \ civil society is being sought for this national cause,\u201D she said.\u201CDuring\
  \ 2014, a total of 17 National, Sub-National and short interval polio campaigns\
  \ were conducted to immunize the target population of 34.6 million children below\
  \ five years of age for each national campaign,\u201D she added.The official figures\
  \ show that on an average 92 percent of the total target population were reached\
  \ during these campaigns. In addition more than 16 million children travelling within\
  \ and from outside the country were vaccinated through Permanent Transit Posts (PTPs)\
  \ working in multiple shifts throughout the country at key points during the year.\
  \ At present only wild polio virus Type 1 is circulating in Pakistan while Type\
  \ 2 was eradicated several years ago and no case of Type 3 virus has been reported\
  \ from anywhere in the country since April 2012.The most recent official data puts\
  \ the total number of confirmed polio cases at 295 in 2014 with 174 cases reported\
  \ from Fata, 67 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 29 from Sindh, 22 from Balochistan and\
  \ 03 from Punjab.Also important to note is that of the 73 wild poliovirus cases\
  \ in Khyber Agency, 59 are from Tehsil Bara, 12 from Jamrud and two from Tirah.\
  \ Also, all wild polio cases except one from Khyber Agency this year have been reported\
  \ from May onwards. Furthermore, vaccination activities have been considerably inconsistent\
  \ in Bara Tehsil of Khyber Agency since June 2009, missing a significant number\
  \ of children.All except 10 polio cases reported from North and South Waziristan\
  \ agencies in 2014 did not receive any dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV). It is important\
  \ to mention that no supplementary immunisation activities have been conducted in\
  \ North and most of South Waziristan agencies since June 2012, leading to an ongoing\
  \ explosive polio outbreak with 37 wild polio cases in 2013 and 93 so far in 2014.The\
  \ district of Peshawar has reported 29 wild poliovirus cases in 2014 so far. The\
  \ reintroduction of wild polio virus with the identification of polio cases from\
  \ the districts of Swat, Kohat, Naseerabad, Pishin and Larkana is a concern which\
  \ also reinforces the fact that the presence of polio virus anywhere is a threat\
  \ everywhere.Of all the polio affected children in 2014 as many as 92 percent came\
  \ from families that speak Pashto and more than 84 percent children are below the\
  \ age of 2 years. It would also be important to add here that 85 percent of the\
  \ polio cases this year are from insecure and security compromised areas and 86\
  \ percent of the children did not receive any routine dose while 64 percent did\
  \ not receive any routine and Polio campaign dose.Ninety-nine percent of parents\
  \ across Pakistan come forward and vaccinate their children every time Polio vaccine\
  \ is offered while the refusals, which are below 1 percent of the target population,\
  \ are based on repeated campaign, religious belief or other misconceptions. According\
  \ to experts the current low transmission season is critical to fighting polio as\
  \ the virus is less active and its transmission can be stopped through repeated\
  \ high quality campaigns."

  \ assembly secretariat are filled by applicants from religious minorities.Sindh\
  \ Assembly MPA on a reserved seat for minorities, Surender Valasai, who belongs\
  \ to the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, has filed the application.  The Sindh government\
  \ had reserved a five per cent job quota for minorities in its different departments,\
  \ subsidiary agencies and bodies some eight years ago.On February 3, 2015, the then\
  \ house of the Sindh Assembly had also unanimously passed a resolution on this subject.\
  \ The resolution was moved by an Opposition MPA of the Pakistan Muslim League-Functional,\
  \ Nand Kumar Goklani. His resolution stated: \u201CThis House resolves that the\
  \ Provincial Government ensure implementation of 5% quota reserved for minorities\
  \ in employment in government jobs in the province.\u201DOn February 6, 2015 the\
  \ Sindh Assembly secretary sent a circular containing the contents of the resolution\
  \ to the relevant senior officials of the Sindh government for the due implementation\
  \ of the resolution.The circular was sent to the then Sindh chief secretary, the\
  \ Sindh government\u2019s secretary for Services, General Administration, and Coordination\
  \ Department, and the Sindh government Secretary for Minorities\u2019 Affairs Department.Talking\
  \ to The News, Goklani, who has once again become an MPA on a seat reserved for\
  \ minorities, said more than three years had passed but he was yet to get any evidence\
  \ that showed that the Sindh government had implemented his resolution.He said the\
  \ previous PPP government had itself issued orders to ensure five per cent quota\
  \ for minorities in government jobs, but it has failed to implement it until now.\u201C\
  Once it is implemented by PPP\u2019s own government in Sindh, then we could expect\
  \ from the federal government to ensure its implementation,\u201D the PML-F MPA\
  \ said.According to Goklani, he had raised the issue several times in the last Sindh\
  \ Assembly by putting questions during the question hour session and by submitting\
  \ call to attention notices, asking for information on government departments where\
  \ the quota had been implemented."

  \ massacre of children at the Army Public School in Peshawar \u2013 2014 may have\

  \ of attempted murder. The latter had to flee the country because he is a bleeding\
  \ heart liberal who refuses to shut up; the former would have been okay if he just\
  \ kept to himself his belief on who targeted him.Instead, because Hamid Mir had\
  \ the temerity to use the news channel he works for to explain, through his brother,\
  \ the threats he received, the permanent power in the country (you know who it is)\
  \ decided to embark on an act of collective injustice, targeting not just the news\
  \ channel but the newspapers associated with the same media group and the employees\
  \ of the group. The channel was taken off the air by Pemra for 15 days for having\
  \ the temerity to report the news. Cable operators decided Geo did not pass go,\
  \ will not collect 200 dollars and will be banished to channel number 97 on the\
  \ cable order.Demonising Geo became a sport with everyone having a go at connecting\

  \ the news channel as part of the conspirators who had stolen an election that was\
  \ rightfully his. His proof of how a news organisation can stuff ballots? It broadcast\
  \ a victory speech by Nawaz Sharif before all the votes had been counted.The Imran-Qadri\
  \ dharnas were a useful barometer of how far we have descended as a country. There\
  \ was Sheikh Rashid, suddenly relevant again, promising \u2013 and achieving \u2013\
  \ blood on the streets. The PML-N government decided the best way to handle protests,\
  \ which is theoretically a right of all Pakistanis, no matter how misguided the\
  \ protest may be, was mowing down Qadri\u2019s supporters in Model Town. All this\
  \ over an election which, like all elections in the country, may have been flawed\
  \ but was better than most we have held.There was one bit of good news in 2014:\
  \ Malala Yousafzai became our second Nobel Laureate. Then we remembered that, like\
  \ our first, she too lives in exile. Many in the country hate her, believe she deserved\

  \ been shot but she works for the CIA \u2013 so who cares?Malala isn\u2019t the\
  \ only person Pakistanis expressed a willingness to kill this year. There were also\
  \ the hordes of menacing polio workers, Hazaras, Christians, Ahmedis and schoolchildren.\
  \ Basically, if you weren\u2019t a Punjabi, Sunni male of means your time could\
  \ be up. If not now, we can always wait for next year when the hit-list will surely\
  \ be expanded.There was some good news too this year. The rupee gained against the\
  \ dollar which is good news for everyone except the dollar khor CIA agents who deserve\
  \ to be killed anyway. Javed Hashmi acted as our collective conscience which is\
  \ why he was aired out for a day or two and then promptly chucked to the back of\
  \ the closet. For the 67th year in a row, the state didn\u2019t officially execute\

text: "Political parties fear military courts may target them\n                  \
  \          ISLAMABAD: A primary reason behind expressing reservations to creation\
  \ of military courts by some political parties is their strong apprehension that\
  \ these forums might be used against politicians.Whether any political party has\
  \ publicly aired such fears or not, every one of them has substantial worries in\
  \ the back of their mind that politicians may fall victim to such courts.However,\
  \ this fear apart, no parliamentary party is opposed to the establishment of military\
  \ courts if they exclusively try terrorists because all want elimination of terrorism\
  \ by employing every possible means and tool. All political forces want conviction\
  \ of militants on fast-track basis.Every parliamentary force including even the\
  \ ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had consented to the proposal, though\
  \ hesitantly, after exhaustive discussions. \u201CWe are sure that the parliamentary\
  \ parties will agree to the creation of these courts at the end of the day as we\
  \ are trying to allay their apprehensions,\u201D a senior source which is part of\
  \ the high-level consultations presided over by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif told\
  \ The News.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which has now partially differed\
  \ with the proposal, had stamped its approval on it during the December 24 second\
  \ meeting of the top parliamentary leaders, which was also attended by Chief of\
  \ Army Staff (COAS) General Raheel Sharif and Director General of the Inter-Services\
  \ (ISI) Lt-Gen Rizwan Akhtar.When the recommendation was floated in the lengthy\
  \ session, PTI Chairman Imran Khan had sought time to mull over it but endorsed\
  \ it just after half an hour in the same deliberations.However, his nominee, Hamid\
  \ Khan, advocate, held the view in Monday\u2019s meeting of constitutional experts\
  \ that the PTI was opposed to the military courts. On the other hand, PTI Information\
  \ Secretary Dr Shireen Mazari quickly contradicted Hamid Khan saying that her party\
  \ was not against such bodies. Confusion about the PTI\u2019s policy has unnecessarily\
  \ been spawned.Almost same is the case with the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP).\
  \ In the December 24 discussions, its representatives had also agreed to the proposal.\
  \ The biggest support, though slightly conditional, to the setting up of the military\
  \ courts had come from a person no less than PPP chief and former president Asif\
  \ Ali Zardari. He had stated at the death anniversary congregation of Benazir Bhutto\
  \ in Garhi Khuda Bux on December 27 that his party has backed the recommendation\
  \ with the condition that these courts will not target politicians.However, PPP\
  \ Senator Raza Rabbani has now expressed reservations over military courts and advised\
  \ the government to learn lessons from thepast as two civilian regimes were toppled\
  \ by martial laws. It was always during the PML-N stints that such courts were set\
  \ up, he said.However, PPP Senator Aitzaz simplified the creation of military courts\
  \ saying that they can be established by bringing about a change in an ordinary\
  \ law that the Parliament can pass with a simple majority, and there is no need\
  \ of any constitutional amendment. \u201CWe rejected the draft presented by the\
  \ attorney general in Monday\u2019s meeting and offered a very brief and simple\
  \ amendment in a law to satisfy the mandate of the December 24 deliberations.\u201D\
  Former Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has also described the proposed\
  \ setting up of military courts as unconstitutional. \u201CMilitary courts are illegal\
  \ and unconstitutional. The basic structure of the Constitution guarantees an independent\
  \ judiciary, and military courts cannot be created in the presence of an independent\
  \ judiciary.\u201DThe Jamaat-e-Islami was the first political party that had stood\
  \ against the idea of military courts. But in the December 24 session, it too had\
  \ changed its mind, though reluctantly. The political parties continue to highlight\
  \ their fears and apprehensions despite the fact that General Raheel Sharif has\
  \ categorically assured the parliamentary leaders that he guarantees that these\
  \ forums would only try \u2018jet black terrorists\u2019 with the objective of getting\
  \ rid of the scourge of terrorism and would not arraign any political figure.The\
  \ parliamentary parties, which concurred to the proposal in the presence of the\
  \ COAS but are disapproving it afterward, are following a hypocritical policy. It\
  \ is quite possible that they will be fully on board after another meeting on the\
  \ pattern of the one held on December 24.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has made it\
  \ clear that the creation of the military courts is part of the 20-point National\
  \ Action Plan (NAP), which was unanimously approved by all the parliamentary parties.As\
  \ per the NAP, the military courts are to function for two years. As they try and\
  \ convict hardcore terrorists, the government may use this period to massively rectify\
  \ the normal criminal justice system so as to enable it to meet the new challenges.The\
  \ final go-ahead to the establishment of military courts from all the parliamentary\
  \ parties may be forthcoming with some more discussions and efforts by the prime\
  \ minister and the army leadership. But the biggest test these forums will face\
  \ will come when they will be challenged in a superior court especially in view\
  \ of the fact that the Supreme Court had declared such tribunals null and void back\
  \ in 1999.Generally, the superior courts treat special tribunals as a parallel judiciary,\
  \ which, they are sure, is not allowed under the Constitution. Whenever special\
  \ courts have been disputed at a judicial forum, superior courts have been laying\
  \ down strict guidelines to be followed by them where the parties involved are given\
  \ the due right of hearing, defence and appeal."

  \ the 12th round of Pakistan-Afghanistan Parliamentarians\u2019 Dialogue here called\
  \ for joint efforts and steady steps for preventing terrorist attacks and reiterated\
  \ their resolve against all kinds of terrorism and extremism affecting the two countries.In\

  \ Institute of Democracy and Transparency (PILDAT) unequivocally condemned the heinous\
  \ and inhuman terrorist attack of December 16 in Peshawar. Similar dastardly terro-rist\
  \ attacks in Kabul and Paktika province were also deplored.Parliamentarians of the\
  \ two countries acknowledged and appreciated the positive momentum in bilateral\
  \ relations generated through the visit of Afghanistan\u2019s newly-elected President\
  \ Mohammad Ashraf Ghani to Pakistan, in November, this year.The parliamentarians\
  \ also appreciated the vision of building a \u201Cpeaceful neighbourhood\u201D of\
  \ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as a fundamental element of which is the vision of\
  \ a strong, comprehensive and enduring partnership between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\
  \ \u201CA strong and viable bilateral relationship between the two countries is\
  \ the only guarantee of the security and prosperity as well as of peace and development\
  \ in the region,\u201D they said. The parliamentarians as representatives of the\

  \ steps to counter terrorism and extremism aimed at ensuring peace and stability\
  \ in the region.Participants of the dialogue underscored the need for bilateral\

  \ two countries, in fight against terrorism, extremism, and for achieving and maintaining\
  \ peace and stability. In this regard, need for comprehensive and effective laws\
  \ on combating terrorism, including cyber terrorism, was underscored. Parliaments\
  \ and parliamentary committees in both countries should oversee effective implementation\
  \ of these laws. Parliamentarians stressed that trade and commerce between the two\
  \ countries must be prioritised and formalised. Both sides also supported removal\
  \ of bottlenecks and trade barriers and emphasised that facilities for transit trade\
  \ between the two neighbouring countries must be improved. They also supported the\
  \ initiatives to enhance connectivity between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including\
  \ through a motorway between Peshawar and Kabul, rail and road links between Parachinar\
  \ and Kabul, Peshawar and Jalalabad and Chaman and Spinbolduk as well as building\
  \ a trade central strategic corridor between the two countries. They also believed\
  \ that mechanisms and opportunities for public private partnerships must also be\
  \ enhanced. The MPs also favoured de-weaponisation and improved drug management\
  \ across the border. Parliamentarians stressed on putting in place a relaxed visa\
  \ regime that allows multiple entry visas of citizens of each country. Speedy visas\
  \ should be issued for citizens travelling for health-related reasons.In addition\
  \ to the need for enhancing educational scholarships for students of Afghanistan,\
  \ the two countries would greatly benefit by cooperation in education."

text: "The power of the pulpit\n                            It is hard to know the\
  \ exact figures or ratios, but it seems from the anecdotal evidence available that\
  \ at a significant number of the tens of thousands of mosques scattered around the\
  \ country, there was only limited or no condemnation \u2013 during Friday sermons\
  \ \u2013 of the Taliban for the attack on a Peshawar school. At some mosques tacit\
  \ support was later expressed for Maulana Abdul Aziz, the Lal Masjid head who implicitly\
  \ defended the Taliban action.It would be interesting to get more detailed reports\
  \ on precisely what was said and where. It would also be fascinating to have before\
  \ us a full break-up of which mosques fall under the influence of which groups.\
  \ It is known that some of the larger ones in both Islamabad and Lahore are controlled\
  \ by hard-line outfits such as the Ahle Sunnat-wal Jamaat, formerly the fiercely\
  \ anti-Shia Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan. Despite a ban placed in 2012, the ASWJ continues\
  \ to operate, apparently with unlimited freedom, and spread its fierce message of\
  \ hatred.Other equally damaging messages are spread through mosques too. These are\
  \ directed against women, minorities and \u2018western elements\u2019. What they\
  \ do is nudge along the mindset that has created a deeply bigoted society. It is\
  \ a mindset we have now discovered we must fight.To do so successfully, we will\
  \ have to use the mosque and its powerful pulpits. In other words, the imams who\
  \ delivers their sermons every Friday to millions of worshippers have to be won\
  \ over to the right side of the fence. This is the only way to swing opinion and\
  \ make anything resembling real difference. How to achieve this is something the\
  \ National Action Committee set up to combat terrorism must consider in some detail.\
  \ In other Muslim countries, ways have been found to incorporate clerics and religious\
  \ scholars into key social battles. In Iran and Bangladesh, they have been used\
  \ to help promote family planning and in Egypt to speak out against a variety of\
  \ social problems including female genital mutilation. We too have to follow this\
  \ path and send out a strong message that militancy and the ideas that support it\
  \ can simply not be permitted to permeate the thinking of people.All this is also\
  \ linked to other factors. Outfits spreading hatred against specific groups need\
  \ to be acted against and removed from the sphere of the mosque. Right now, it is\
  \ known that many of the clerics who run smaller mosques in towns or big cities\
  \ fall under their broader umbrella. The mosques, especially in small towns where\
  \ rates of unemployment are high, have also become a recruitment place where extremist\
  \ groups pick up aimless young men for their own purposes. Ajmal Kasab, aged 25\
  \ years when he was hanged in an Indian jail in 2012 for his role in the siege of\
  \ Mumbai four years before that, is an example of the manner in which this process\
  \ takes place. We need to bring it to a halt.Somehow, the clerics delivering weekly\
  \ sermons in mosques need to be brought over to speak against militancy. The key\
  \ problem of course is the funding that comes in to too many mosques or groups linked\
  \ to them in the country, in some cases from sources outside our borders. Nations\
  \ like Bangladesh have found it possible to begin schemes where mosque imams are\
  \ paid to deliver the right kind of messages. We could replicate this model. But\
  \ it would be possibly only if the government was able to surpass the scale of money\
  \ provided by far richer agents who have become key players in the game of death\
  \ in which we are pawns.Spreading messages that alter the manner in which people\
  \ think is nevertheless vital. The media of course could be a central player in\
  \ this. Right now, we have clerics who go along with a particular code of thought\
  \ taught to them at madressahs and by their own teachers. This suggests to them\
  \ that they need to support hard-line views in various ways and inculcate more and\
  \ more people into a specific mould. The mosque, notably since the Zia years, has\
  \ played a key part in creating this mould. It must now play an equal part in breaking\
  \ it.Those who regularly attend mosques speak of the pamphlets distributed within\
  \ many of them, promoting banned groups, or the attempts to collect funds for these\
  \ organizations. In some cases, the clerics of the mosques may not even be aware\
  \ of the nature of the groups they are collecting for. Many are, after all, only\
  \ semi-literate themselves and some may believe they are truly serving a good cause.\
  \ These men who hold significant influence in our society need to be re-educated\
  \ and retrained. A massive scheme of some kind needs to be adopted for this purpose.\
  \ This has been achieved to a certain degree in countries like Egypt, mainly through\
  \ the efforts of the Al-Azhar University in Cairo which stands at the centre of\
  \ the more enlightened views on religion. It is possibly arguable as to why we should\
  \ need to turn to religion in this fashion within our state. After all, it is no\
  \ obscure fact that killing is wrong and the murder of children one of the worst\
  \ offences possible under any rule of humanity or religion. But it appears we need\
  \ to be reminded of this more forcefully than is currently the case. Yes, the Peshawar\
  \ episode has evoked a great deal of shock and horror. But, we need to move forward\
  \ in a way that it is ensured it is not forgotten and never repeated. This can be\
  \ possible only if we are able to alter a great deal about the kind of society we\
  \ have become and remove certain elements that play such a big part in shaping it.Linked\
  \ to the mosque is the question of madressah schools. These have mushroomed primarily\
  \ because of the collapse of the public sector education system. Only a few amongst\
  \ them offer anything resembling actual training in militancy. But almost all pass\
  \ on a particular pattern of thought which in the limited surveys conducted indicates\
  \ learning to see India as an enemy nation and regarding women as being inherently\
  \ inferior. A large number of the clerics who run these mosques have themselves\
  \ emerged from madressahs. These institutes then need to be looked at very carefully\
  \ and policies adopted to at least offer people more options about where they can\
  \ educate their children rather than keeping them within seminaries simply on the\
  \ basis that there is no other place where they can be given education free of all\
  \ cost and also provided food and shelter.These are all matters we need to pay greater\
  \ heed to. The action taken recently against specific clerics promoting hatred is\
  \ welcome. The fact that the judges who wrote out arrest orders in these cases are\
  \ in need of protection tells us just how difficult the task we face is. But the\
  \ mosque and the pulpit need to play a central role in changing the face of our\
  \ country \u2013 which has grown uglier by the decade. We should hear words of true\
  \ wisdom once spoken from the buildings that symbolise our religion. It is sad this\
  \ is not the case today. The writer is a freelance columnist and former newspaper\

text: "Oil price plunge gives Pakistan breathing space\n                         \
  \   Pakistan has obtained a breathing space in the wake of steep decline in prices\
  \ of petroleum products in the international market, which will ease down fiscal\
  \ woes of the country over the short-term.The windfall gains obtained through reduced\
  \ oil prices will not last long in 2015, if structural bottlenecks of the economy\
  \ such as energy outages, security concerns and revenue mobilisation are not resolved.The\
  \ real concern for the government will be continuous trend of low GDP growth again\
  \ this year, as despite tall claims the real GDP growth will not be able to cross\
  \ four percent of GDP against the envisaged target of 5.1 percent for 2014/15.Last\
  \ year growth of 4.1 percent will be revised downward in accordance with the annual\
  \ revision, but this low base will not help jack up growth figure for the ongoing\
  \ fiscal year up to the desired level of the economic managers mainly because of\
  \ bad performance of agriculture and manufacturing sectors.It clearly indicates\
  \ there will be job opportunities for new entrants in the labour market and prevalence\
  \ of poverty will continue to rise during the calendar year 2015.Another challenge\
  \ for the government during 2015 will be keeping the International Monetary Fund\
  \ (IMF) programme on track after completion of the sixth review, which was scheduled\
  \ to be completed by the end of February or early March, 2015.The IMF had largely\
  \ recovered its previous loans, which it provided to Islamabad under the PPP dispensation.\
  \ Now the net inflows are going to start and the phase of tough conditions will\
  \ also be gauged by the IMF from the second quarter (April-June) period of the ongoing\
  \ fiscal year 2014/15.But experts said the breathing space obtained by Islamabad\
  \ in the aftermath of reduction in POL prices would go a long way in keeping the\
  \ IMF programme on track over the short-term and this incumbent regime would be\
  \ able to manage completion of the next review (sixth review) of the IMF programme\
  \ without facing much difficulty.The fiscal side of the economy is real problematic\
  \ area in the wake of expected shortfall in the revenue collection of the Federal\
  \ Board of Revenue (FBR). The government had envisaged annual tax collection target\
  \ of Rs2,810 billion and the IMF had already projected downward revision from Rs2,810\
  \ billion to Rs2,756 billion. However, economists say the FBR\u2019s tax collection\
  \ will stand at the maximum of around Rs2,550 to Rs2,600 billion.In order to bridge\
  \ the gap, the government has jacked up the general sales tax (GST) rate from 17\
  \ percent to 22 percent on POL products in order to offset the revenue losses because\
  \ of reduction in oil prices in the international market.The subsidy to the power\
  \ sector will also decline because of falling prices of the furnace oil so it will\
  \ help curtail the budget deficit close to the level agreed with the IMF for the\
  \ current fiscal year.The interest rates are on the declining trend in the wake\
  \ of decreasing inflation because of base effect in the same period of the last\
  \ fiscal year, but it will rebound in the second half (January-June) period of the\
  \ current fiscal year because of the possible upsurge in the energy prices. But\
  \ inflation on an average will remain around seven percent so the discount rate\
  \ will also come down.\u201CIn the wake of possible reduction in the interest rates,\
  \ Pakistan\u2019s debt servicing will be scaled down by Rs120 to Rs130 billion during\
  \ the current fiscal year on account of both external, as well as domestic loans,\u201D\

  \ is declining trends in fetching exports of Pakistani made-ups, which would become\
  \ headache for the economic managers on the long-term basis.There is a silver lining\
  \ on the economic front, as well. If Islamabad manages to attract committed Chinese\

text: "Legal experts slam sales tax increase procedure\n                         \
  \   KARACHI: Legal experts appeared skeptical on Wednesday as to whether finance\
  \ mangers followed the proper procedure in imposing an increase in sales tax on\
  \ petroleum products.They objected on the SRO issued by finance ministry, which\
  \ increased sales tax by 29.5 percent on POL products, saying that it should only\
  \ be act of parliament.\u201CThere are clear instructions in the Constitution and\
  \ Supreme Court orders regarding imposition of tax,\u201D Dr. Ikram ul Haq, advocate\
  \ Supreme Court and leading tax consultant said.A day earlier, the revenue division\
  \ of ministry of finance issued SRO 1152(I)/2014 to enhance the sales tax to 22\
  \ percent from 17 percent, effective January 01, 2015 in order to offset the decline\
  \ in revenue collection due to the oil price shocks.The revenue division issued\
  \ the notification exercising powers vested in clause b sub-section 2 of Section\
  \ 3 of Sales Tax Act, 1990, which allows the federal government to impose tax through\
  \ a notification.Dr. Haq, however, said the Supreme Court in Human Rights Case No\
  \ 14392 of 2013 [2014 PTD 243], combining many others, disapproved undue hikes in\
  \ utilities provided to people and in Iqbal Zafar Jhagra v Federation of Pakistan\
  \ (2014) declared levying of taxes through executive orders unconstitutional.The\
  \ government, despite such cases, which are binding under the Constitution, has\
  \ been resorting to infamous SROs for levy of taxes, he said and added: \u201CSuch\
  \ move of the government may be challenged in court of law.\u201DThe government\
  \ increased the sales tax considering sharp fall in prices of petroleum products\
  \ and a threat to revenue collection. The combined contribution of POL products\
  \ on imports and local supplies is about 40 percent towards total sales tax.Munawar\
  \ H. Shaikh, President, Pakistan Tax Bar Association said the government should\
  \ avoid taking such decision and should go to the parliament for appropriate approval.He\
  \ said the finance minister himself on several occasions announced elimination of\
  \ SRO culture.Another senior tax lawyer, requesting anonymity, said the Supreme\
  \ Court in its observation made in the order of 2013 that the parliament/ legislature\
  \ alone and not the government/executive is empowered to levy tax.The apex court\
  \ in the case also observed: \u201CAs far as delegation of such powers to the Government/Executive\
  \ is concerned, the same is for the purpose of implementation of such laws, which\
  \ is to be done by framing rules, or issuing notifications or guidelines, depending\
  \ upon case to case, as we have come across some of the cases noted hereinabove.\
  \ But in no case, authority to levy tax for the Federation is to be delegated to\
  \ the Government/Executive.\u201DThe lawyer, however, said at present different\
  \ sales tax rates are implemented, if considered Supreme Court judgment, all the\
  \ rates should be withdrawn.On the other hand, officials in Federal Board of Revenue\
  \ (FBR), said soft oil prices have dented sales tax revenue. \u201CIn addition,\
  \ the collection of advance income tax also started declining,\u201D said a FBR\
  \ official.Legal experts admitted the current revenue crisis but said the government\
  \ should present the revision in sales tax rate before the parliament, which is\
  \ summoned on January 1, 2015. They also suggested that the FBR should explore other\
  \ avenues such as broadening of tax base and bringing elites into tax net, who are\
  \ already identified by the tax authorities."

text: "Hanged PAF man was close aide of TTP leader\n                            ISLAMABAD:\
  \ Niaz Mohammad, who was executed the other day in Peshawar Central Prison for trying\
  \ to kill General Pervez Musharraf, used to be a former technician of the Pakistan\
  \ Air Force, who was a close aide of Adnan Rasheed, the chief operational commander\
  \ of the TTP-linked Ansarul Aseer (Helpers of the Prisoners) - a lethal jehadi unit\
  \ which was founded to secure freedom for the imprisoned jehadis by conducting jail\
  \ break operations.Of the seven people hanged so far since the lifting of the moratorium\
  \ on executions last month, six had been involved in two abortive attempts to assassinate\
  \ Pervez Musharraf eleven years ago in Rawalpindi in December 2003. The remaining\
  \ one - Aqeel alias Dr Usman - had also tried to target Musharraf\u2019s plane at\
  \ Chaklala Airport in Rawalpindi with a shoulder missile. However, he was handed\
  \ down a death sentence and sent to the gallows for spearheading the October 10,\
  \ 2009 fidayeen attack targeting the General Headquarters of the Pakistan Army in\
  \ Rawalpindi. Of the seven people hanged so far over the past fortnight, four were\
  \ civilians. While Aqeel alias Dr Usman and Arshad Mahmood alias Mehrban, who were\
  \ hanged in Faisalabad on December 22, belonged to the Pakistan Army, Niaz Mohammad,\
  \ who was executed in Peshawar on December 31, was a PAF employee. Niaz, a resident\
  \ of Yar Hussain area in Swabi district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was kept at the Haripur\
  \ Central Prison until December 30 when he was shifted to Peshawar Central Prison\
  \ in a helicopter, before being executed. According to the military circles, in\
  \ the first assassination attempt on Musharraf, which took place near Jhanda Chichi\
  \ bridge in Rawalpindi on December 14, 2003, six PAF personnel were convicted by\
  \ a field general court martial at the PAF Base Chaklala on October 3, 2005. Besides\
  \ Niaz, four more PAF personnel were also sentenced to death that also included\
  \ a former junior technician Adnan Rashid, who later escaped during the 2012 Bannu\
  \ jailbreak and later joined hands with the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. The other\
  \ three PAF personnel included former chief technician Khalid Mahmood, former senior\
  \ technician Karam Din, and former corporal, Nawazish. The sixth convict, Nasrullah,\
  \ a junior technician, was sentenced to life imprisonment. A PAF appellate court\
  \ dismissed the joint appeal of the six accused in February 2006. Almost a month\
  \ later, on March 28, 2006, the Lahore High Court also dismissed their petitions.\
  \ Six months later, a Supreme Court bench headed by then Chief Justice Iftikhar\
  \ Mohammad Chaudhry had rejected their appeals against the high court verdict [on\
  \ September 25, 2006]. The bench held that under Article 199 of the Constitution,\
  \ civil courts had no jurisdiction to issue writ against orders passed by the military\
  \ courts. In petitions, Niaz Mohammad and other five convicts had alleged they had\
  \ falsely been implicated in the case. They claimed they had voted against General\
  \ Musharraf in the 2002 referendum and, therefore, they were picked up by the agencies\
  \ following the 2003 attempts on his life, only to be kept in illegal detention\
  \ during which they were severely tortured.The proximity between Niaz Mohammad and\
  \ Adnan Rasheed can be gauged from the fact that they had spent most of their prison\
  \ term together, unlike the other four PAF personnel. In September 2011, Adnan Rasheed\
  \ and his comrade Niaz Khan were shifted from Haripur central jail to Peshawar prison.\
  \ The transfer was against their wishes and both prisoners went on a hunger strike\
  \ in protest. Adnan used to be the prayer leader in the Haripur Jail and had a strong\
  \ influence over the prisoners. In 2011, Adnan and Niaz ensured that Eid was celebrated\
  \ on two different days in Haripur Jail, as per the custom in Khyber Pakthunkhwa\
  \ province, where majority of the rigid clerics do not celebrate Eid with the government.\
  \ As they refused to end their hunger strike, Adnan and Niaz were shifted to two\
  \ separate jails - Adnan was lodged in the Bannu Jail while Niaz was taken to the\
  \ Mansehra District Jail.Therefore, while Adnan was freed by the Taliban in the\
  \ 2012 Bannu jailbreak operation, Niaz stayed behind bars because of being in another\
  \ jail, only to be executed the other day. Adnan was freed on April 15, 2012 when\
  \ around 200 Taliban militants armed with guns, grenades and rockets attacked the\
  \ high-security Bannu Central Jail and released 384 prisoners. The then TTP spokesman\
  \ Ehsanullah Ehsan had subsequently declared on April 20, 2012 that the operation\
  \ was mainly aimed at freeing Adnan. Ehsanullah had added that the Taliban had been\
  \ working on the jailbreak plan for several months and that they had been in touch\
  \ with Adnan and some other prisoners in the Bannu Central Jail.Interestingly, despite\
  \ being an al-Qaeda linked convicted terrorist, Adnan was allowed to get married\
  \ in the jail in 2010 and become father of a daughter. Adnan Rasheed actually worked\
  \ for Amjad Farooqi, the al-Qaeda-linked Lashkar-e-Jhangvi terrorist who had engineered\
  \ the twin suicide attacks against Musharraf at the behest of al-Qaeda leader Abu\
  \ Faraj al Libi. Coming from Chota Lahore village of the Swabi district, Adnan had\
  \ joined the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in 1997, before being arrested for his role\
  \ in an attempt to kill Musharraf in Rawalpindi on December 14, 2003. He has already\
  \ been elevated as the chief operational commander of a lethal fidayeen unit of\
  \ TTP - Ansarul Aseer whose stated mission is to secure freedom for imprisoned jehadis\
  \ by conducting jailbreak operations. In a video-taped message released on March\
  \ 25, 2013, Adnan had threatened to assassinate Musharraf, adding that he has constituted\
  \ a death squad which would hunt down the former dictator for having ordered the\
  \ 2007 Lal Masjid massacre.Since his release, he has led several guerrilla operations\
  \ - the most significant being the July 30, 2013 Dera Ismail Khan jailbreak raid\
  \ in which 275 most wanted militants were freed. Almost a month before conducting\
  \ DI Khan raid, Adnan had claimed in a rare interview that he was indoctrinated\
  \ by a covert jehadi group which recruits officers from the three military services\
  \ and utilises them to wage jehad along with the Taliban. The interview was published\
  \ in the May 2013 issue of an English-language jehadi magazine \u201CAzan\u201D\
  \ which was launched by the Taliban elements, primarily to cater the educated Muslims.\
  \ Adnan had claimed that his first jehadi inclination emerged when the Indians were\
  \ compelled to release Maulana Masood Azhar after the 2000 hijacking of an Indian\
  \ plane. He said he was about to travel to Germany for higher education when the\
  \ 9/11 terrorist attacks took place and his colleagues in the PAF persuaded him\
  \ to pursue the jehadi path. In a latest development, while refuting the rumours\
  \ of his death in the ongoing military operation in Waziristan, Adnan Rasheed has\
  \ appeared in a video message [released on December 30, 2014], accusing the Pakistani\
  \ establishment of taking a U-turn after using militants in Jammu Kashmir and Afghanistan\
  \ and labeling them as terrorists. Following his trusted aide Niaz Mohammad\u2019\
  s execution the other day, the next PAF personnel to be executed for trying to kill\
  \ Musharraf is a former chief technician of the PAF, Khalid Mehmood who was associated\
  \ with 310 GC Wing and comes from Dunyapur area of the Lodhran district in Punjab."

  \ Punjab government has received overwhelming response to Chief Minister Apna Rozgar\
  \ Scheme as over 150,000 have applicants applied for the pick-up vans after two\
  \ weeks extension in the deadline. The deadline was extended after poor response\
  \ was due to some strict conditions regarding eligibility criteria as majority of\
  \ the applicants were unable to apply under the scheme. Initially, the Punjab government\
  \ had fixed November 28, 2014 last date for the submission of applications under\
  \ Apna Rozgar Scheme for providing pick-up vans to unemployed people in the province\
  \ on five-year long mark-up free payment plan. Realising lacklustre response of\
  \ people due to some conditions the criteria was later amended and last date extended\
  \ to December 15, 2014. For the applicants, age limit was fixed between 21 to 35\
  \ years in the matriculation qualification and valid driving licence issued on or\
  \ before October 31, 2014. The criteria was later amended as majority of the interested\
  \ applicants did not have valid driving licence, required academic certificate and\
  \ age. The government increased the age limit up to 40 years, no minimum education\
  \ and driving licence issued till last date of submission of applications, i.e.\
  \ December 15, 2014. The steering committee of Chief Minister Apna Rozgar Scheme\
  \ held a meeting after receiving applications from across the Punjab which was exceeded\
  \ to 150,000. As per the plan, the government has decided to give 50,000 vehicles.\
  \ However, more than 125,000 applications have been received for Suzuki Bolan against\
  \ the approved 25,000 vehicles and over 25,000 applications for Suzuki Ravi against\
  \ 25,000 vehicles. Out of every five applicants, one will get Suzuki Bolan vehicle\
  \ application while in Suzuki Ravi category, majority of the applicants will succeed\
  \ in getting vehicles even without balloting due to limited number of applications.\
  \ The members of the Steering Committee talking to The News confirmed that more\
  \ than 150,000 applications received under the Chief Minister Apna Rozgar Scheme.\
  \ It was decided that balloting of the applications should be started in the first\
  \ week of January, 2015. The committees would set up at the district and divisional\
  \ levels for the balloting of the applicants which would be completed by the first\
  \ week of January 2015, they said. Under the scheme, quota of the vehicles has been\
  \ divided among the districts on population basis which is further bifurcated to\
  \ 50-50 for each Suzuki Bolan and Suzuki Ravi. In the case of Suzuki Bolan, applications\
  \ received from each district are more than the assigned quota while in Suzuki Ravi\
  \ case, applications from districts of North and Central Punjab, are less than the\
  \ quota. Thus, almost all the applicants of Suzuki Ravi from these districts will\
  \ be successful even without balloting. The balloting will be held for Suzuki Bolan\
  \ across Punjab."

  \ Adulterated food\u2019s unchecked availability across the city has created serious\
  \ health issues for hundreds of thousands of people owing to the poor performance\
  \ of Punjab Food Authority (PFA) during 2014.The Punjab Food Authority (PFA), which\
  \ is the sole authority to enforce food-related laws in the provincial metropolis,\
  \ has completely failed to ensure its presence and protect the people from adulterated\
  \ and unhygienic food and edibles.During the year, the PFA checked 103,099 shops,\
  \ hotels, restaurants, marriage halls, water plants, manufacturing units and etc\
  \ out of which it sealed only 2,181 entrepreneurs putting a question mark on its\
  \ performance.The authority also issued notices to only 24,164 businesses for unhygienic\
  \ conditions and in most of the cases the businesses were back to the same state\
  \ of affairs after some hours or the next day. During the whole year, the authority\
  \ collected only 10,577 samples of various edibles which were far less than the\
  \ perceived targets. Despite a hue and cry over adulterated food especially grains\
  \ and spices not a single sample was taken from Akbari Mandi, the biggest grain\
  \ and spices market in the provincial capital.The action and campaign of the PFA\
  \ against water filtration plants also failed as it only issued licences to 281\
  \ such plants while others continued to operate without any checks and balances.\
  \ It is pertinent to mention that most of these unregistered water filtration plants\
  \ are supplying tap water to the citizens in the name of mineral water and many\
  \ of them are suffering from dangerous diseases especially different types of hepatitis\
  \ due to these water plants.Milk adulteration remained on top of all the food items\
  \ and the PFA again failed to ensure supply of hygienic and nutritious milk to the\
  \ citizens during the year. The authority collected 4,300 milk samples out of which\
  \ 2,604 were rejected due to presence of dangerous chemicals. However, supply of\
  \ milk containing formolime, urea and other hazardous chemicals continued in the\
  \ nook and corner of the city.During the year 2014, the authority also failed to\
  \ check and ensure purity in the Ramazan, Model and Sasta Bazaars. Statistics show\
  \ that during the last Ramazan, the authority closed down only 15 stalls in all\
  \ the Ramazan and Model Bazaars of nine towns during 3,039 raids. During these raids,\
  \ the PFA teams only confiscated 38 kg Baisan, 114 kg Ketchup, 32 liter juice, 18\
  \ kg ghee, 32 kg salt, 3 kg corn floor, 4 kg Chat Masala, 11 kg Bhally, 62 kg pulses\
  \ and 2,353 liter juice.During the year, adulteration in food items from milk to\
  \ beverages, bottled water, fruit and vegetable products, oil and fats, spices,\
  \ tea, sauces, sweetening agents and sweets and backing products went on unchecked\
  \ in the provincial metropolis. Both low and high-priced category edibles were no\
  \ exception and one could easily find adulterated and contaminated items in the\
  \ city."

  \         Karachi The year 2014 did not makes lives better for the people of Sindh\
  \ in terms of healthcare, and the provincial government stuck to merely making announcements\
  \ instead of actually starting new projects and facilitating the masses. Several\
  \ people died in Karachi of infectious diseases including dengue and Congo hemorrhagic\
  \ fever and the brain-eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, also claimed many lives.\
  \ The provincial health authorities, however, took no significant steps to improve\
  \ health facilities and the environmental conditions to control such outbreaks.\
  \ The battle with polio continued to suffer setbacks in the year as over two dozen\
  \ children were diagnosed with the disease, most of them in Karachi. The provincial\
  \ managers of the Expanded Program of Immunisation appeared helpless in eliminating\
  \ the disease. The provincial government\u2019s biggest failure was seen in Tharparkar,\
  \ where hundreds of children died of malnutrition and lack of basic health facilities.\
  \ Many women also lost their lives during childbirth.The government failed to provide\
  \ immediate and relief and avert the loss of lives in the drought-hit district.\
  \ The control of the health department returned to the Pakistan People\u2019s Party\
  \ after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement parted ways with the provincial government\
  \ and Jam Mehtab Dahar was appointed its minister replacing Dr Sagheer Ahmed in\
  \ October. The government announced several projects during the year to provide\
  \ more and better health facilities to the masses including five new medical colleges,\
  \ a rescue ambulance service, four blood transfusion centres with foreign funding\
  \ and seven thalassaemia centres, but none of these projects were started. The government\
  \ also announced that it would set up five new burns centres and an accident and\
  \ trauma centre but these projects could not kick off as well. The provincial budget\
  \ for the fiscal year 2014-15 contained allocations for the rescue ambulance service,\
  \ health call centres, a central diagnostic centre at the Civil hospital, expansion\
  \ of the OPDs at major hospitals in the province, a solar energy cold chain system\
  \ to maintain the efficacy of the vaccines and various other major and minor schemes,\
  \ but the government was unable to start working on them. In fact, the Benazir Bhutto\
  \ trauma and accident centre project, a project announced six years ago, could also\
  \ not be materialised this year. The provincial government had announced setting\
  \ up a major, tertiary-care hospital with 400 beds in Gulshan-e-Iqbal in Karachi.\
  \ But it failed to even perform its ground-breaking. Another area of neglect was\
  \ the promotion of medical education in the province. The previous coalition provincial\
  \ government of the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement had announced that it would\
  \ establish five new medical colleges and also laid their foundation stones. The\
  \ government had earmarked Rs1.14 billion for setting up these medical colleges\
  \ in Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Khairpur, Karachi and Hyderabad and they had to be completed\
  \ by 2014, but no headway was made in this regard too. The state of healthcare deteriorated\
  \ in the province, especially in Karachi, where three major hospitals were transferred\
  \ to provincial control after the 18th Constitutional Amendment. These services\
  \ at these hospitals suffered because of lack of attention, monitoring and funding\
  \ by the provincial government. The provincial government\u2019s inability to run\
  \ these hospitals can be gauged from the fact that it has recently announced privatising\
  \ the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, the National Institute of Child\
  \ Health and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. More than 5,000 patients died\
  \ during treatment at the JPMC alone during the outgoing year."

  \ believe that in the end Pakistan\u2019s success is my success, hence I am proud\
  \ of actors like Fawad Khan who represented the country in a positive manner\u201D\
  , says Faysal Quraishi, GEO TV\u2019s blockbuster \u2018Bashar Momin\u2019s lead\
  \ actor. The year 2014 left us all reeling with shocks and a great sense of loss\
  \ over the greatest human tragedies in Lahore and then in Peshawar this country\
  \ had ever witnessed since its inception. However, for some of the homely citizens,\
  \ especially women, Geo TV did bring a little joy in the otherwise highly disturbed\
  \ general public with its epic family oriented blockbusters like Bashar Momin, Ikraar,\
  \ and many other spellbinding presentations. One of the most inspiring television\
  \ personalities, who outshined many others owning to GEO TV network\u2019s memorable\
  \ plays, remains the brilliant young actor Faysal Quraishi. Having started on a\
  \ high note, 2014 definitely turned out to be an exciting year for Faysal Quraishi.\
  \ His grand project Bashar Momin went on to become one of the most watched serials\
  \ of the year. The lavish sets, gripping storyline and Faysal\u2019s on-screen chemistry\
  \ with actress Ushna Shah, received acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Besides\
  \ doing many other glamorous TV shows, Faysal also starred in a serious TV play\
  \ named Adhuri Aurat which dealt with a sensitive topic of breast cancer. He became\
  \ the first Pakistani celebrity to launch his own smart phone application and remained\
  \ as one of the most popular morning show hosts through his show on a TV channel.\
  \ His show Ikraar, where he stars opposite Resham, is currently being aired on GEO\
  \ TV and receiving a great response. Along with other popular Pakistani TV shows\
  \ that were handpicked to be aired in India, Faysal\u2019s Mano Salwa (renamed Tere\
  \ Ishq Mein) and Meri Zaat Zara-e-Benishaan (renamed Kaisi Yeh Qayamat) were two\
  \ of the most popular viewed shows across the border. After winning accolades in\
  \ Pakistan, the shows were welcomed in India with the same enthusiasm and resulted\
  \ in receiving a lot of fans\u2019 mails and interview requests by faysal from there.\
  \ Speaking about the success of his shows in 2014, Faysal said \u201CI am humbled\
  \ by the love India\u2019s viewers have given not only to my shows, but to all of\
  \ our Pakistani shows. Unfortunately the Peshawar incident left me so shaken that\
  \ all the happiness had paled in comparison. I cannot stop thinking about what has\
  \ happened and cannot focus on any future projects right now, although I have very\
  \ exciting plans for the New Year initially. May God show mercy on our country and\
  \ keep us and our children safe. That\u2019s my only expectation from 2015\u201D\
  . Faysal Quraishi began his acting career at the tender age of six when he first\
  \ appeared in a PTV\u2019s play Emergency Ward. As a child he also appeared in the\
  \ drama, Andhera Ujala. At the age of 18 Faysal starred in a movie Saza. Four short\
  \ years and 19 films later Faysal Quraishi quit the movie industry and pursued a\
  \ career in the television drama acting instead. His first major appearance in the\
  \ TV acting was a role as Boota in Tooba Tek Singh. Faysal began acting in television\
  \ in 1999 following which in 2003 he hosted his first show with Showbiz Pakistan\
  \ after which he also hosted Hero Bannay Ke Tarang and was a judge on Pakistan Next\
  \ Mega Star and Nachle."

text: "PTI regime to follow the Swedish governance model\nLAHORE: Premier Imran Khan-led\
  \ Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is reportedly going to follow the transparent governance\
  \ model of Sweden, which has the lowest levels of national debt, low and stable\
  \ inflation and a relatively healthy banking system among the European Union states,\
  \ research conducted by the \"Jang Group and Geo Television Network\" shows.Few\
  \ vital demographic and economic facts about Sweden: At 450,295 square kilometres,\
  \ Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area. Sweden has\
  \ a total population of 10.2 million, of which 2.4 million has a foreign background.\
  \ According to the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition, only\
  \ 30.7% of Swedes live in urban areas The total nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\
  \ of Sweden is over $601 billion, twice that of Pakistan!The nominal Swedish Per\
  \ Capita GDP is $58,345. Sweden is the 32nd largest export economy in the world.\
  \ In 2016, Sweden exported commodities totaling $133 billion and imported goods\
  \ worth $131 billion, resulting in a positive trade balance of $2.39 billion. In\
  \ 2016, Sweden had a tax-to-GDP ratio of 44.1% compared with the 36-member OECD's\
  \ average of 34.3% and compared to Pakistan's dismal 12.5 %. The enviable Swedish\
  \ road to success:According to Swedish government's official websites, the country's\
  \ economy used to suffer from low growth and high inflation, and the Swedish krona\
  \ was repeatedly devalued. Sweden was also hit by a deep financial crisis in the\
  \ early 1990s. Banks became unstable and two were nationalized, unemployment rose\
  \ rapidly, government spending got out of control, and so did Sweden\u2019s national\
  \ debt. The road back to stability and success was not easy for Sweden. But by pursuing\
  \ inventive and courageous reforms and sticking to them, Sweden has transformed\
  \ its economy and stayed strong in the face of the new global recession. Since the\
  \ crisis of the 1990s, successive Swedish governments have been balancing the budget\
  \ for over a decade, and have continued to do so even in the wake of the 2007\u2013\
  2008 global financial crises. Sweden reinvented its economic governance with a series\
  \ of innovative regulations. First, in 1996 a ceiling for government expenditures\
  \ was introduced. This was accompanied by the addition of the \u2018surplus goal\u2019\
  \ for the government budget. These reforms have met with broad support from across\
  \ the political spectrum in Sweden. They help ensure that high debt doesn\u2019\
  t accumulate and that debt isn\u2019t passed on to future generations.Additionally,\
  \ in 2007 the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council was established. This committee of experts\
  \ audits the government\u2019s policy decisions regarding public finances and aims\
  \ to ensure that they remain consistent with the goals of growth, employment and\
  \ long-term financial sustainability. The Swedish government\u2019s credible management\
  \ of the public finances has meant that Sweden remains in the top league of fiscally\
  \ responsible countries in Europe. While governments with large budget deficits\
  \ carry out austerity measures by increasing taxes and cutting public spending,\
  \ Sweden has avoided these difficulties. In fact, taxes in Sweden have actually\
  \ been lowered since the crisis began. Sweden has also continued to invest in areas\
  \ like healthcare, education and research, instead of having to cut heavily in these\
  \ areas like in some countries. Research shows that the parliamentary democracy\
  \ of Sweden has three levels of government: national, regional and local. Approximately\
  \ seven million people in the country entitled to vote in this Scandinavian nation\
  \ with thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes, along with vast boreal forests\
  \ and glaciated mountains. At parliamentary, municipal and county council elections\
  \ held every four years, voters elect those who are to decide how Sweden is governed\
  \ and administered.National level: At the national level, the Swedish people are\
  \ represented by the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) which has legislative powers.\
  \ Proposals for new laws are presented by the Government which also implements decisions\
  \ taken by the Riksdag. The Government is assisted in its work by the Government\
  \ Offices, comprising a number of ministries, and some 400 central government agencies\
  \ and public administrations. The Government implements the Riksdag's decisions\
  \ and draws up proposals for new laws or law amendments. There are many ways of\
  \ influencing Swedish politics, for example by taking part in referendums, joining\
  \ a political party or sending in your comments on reports presented by the Government.Regional\
  \ level: Sweden is divided into 21 counties. Political tasks at this level are undertaken\
  \ on the one hand by the county councils, whose decision-makers are directly elected\
  \ by the people of the county and, on the other, by the county administrative boards\
  \ which are government bodies in the counties. Some public authorities also operate\
  \ at regional and local levels, for example through county boards.Local level: Sweden\
  \ has 290 municipalities. Each municipality has an elected assembly, the municipal\
  \ council, which takes decisions on municipal matters. The municipal council appoints\
  \ the municipal executive board, which leads and coordinates municipality work.The\
  \ Constitution: Basic provisions defining how Sweden shall be governed are enshrined\
  \ in the Constitution. In these fundamental laws the relationship between decision-making\
  \ and executive power is set out and also the freedoms and rights enjoyed by citizens.\
  \ Among other things, the Instrument of Government guarantees citizens the right\
  \ to freely procure information, hold demonstrations, form political parties and\
  \ practice their religion.The Freedom of the Press Act: In another of the fundamental\
  \ laws, the Freedom of the Press Act, the principle of public access to official\
  \ documents is set out in order to guarantee an open society with access to information\
  \ about the work of the Riksdag, the Government and public agencies. This openness\
  \ entitles the Swedish people to study official documents. Anyone may avail him/herself\
  \ of this possibility whenever they wish.Division of responsibility between levels\
  \ of government: The Swedish Constitution contains provisions defining the relationship\
  \ between decision-making and executive power. The 1992 Swedish Local Government\
  \ Act regulates division into municipalities and the organization and powers of\
  \ the municipalities and county councils. It also contains rules for elected representatives,\
  \ municipal councils, executive boards and committees.The division of tasks between\
  \ central government and municipalities has changed over the years. Activities have\
  \ chiefly been transferred from central government to municipal bodies, inter alia\
  \ for democratic reasons. In municipalities it is easier to maintain continuous\
  \ contact between decision-makers and the private individual The Government has\
  \ appointed a parliamentary committee, the Committee on Public Sector Responsibilities,\
  \ which has been instructed to look into the division of responsibility between\
  \ different levels of government In addition, there is the European level which\
  \ has acquired increasing importance following Sweden's entry into the European\
  \ Union.The European level: On entering the EU in 1995, Sweden acquired a further\
  \ level of government: the European level. As a member of the Union, Sweden takes\
  \ part in the decision-making process when new common rules are drafted and approved.\
  \ Sweden is represented by the Government in the European Council of Ministers,\
  \ which is the EU's principal decision-making body.{C}{C}to assume charge as Governors\
  \ of Punjab. Till date since 1970, most of the Punjab Governors have hailed from\
  \ Pakistan People\u2019s Party and late Salman Taseer remains the only unfortunate\
  \ one to be assassinated in office. The post-1970 Punjab Governors (Acting and permanent)\
  \ include:Lt General Attiqur Rahman, Ghulam Mustafa Khar, Hanif Ramay, Nawab Sadiq\
  \ Hussain Qureshi, Mohammad Abbas Khan Abbasi, Aslam Riaz Hussain, Vice Chief of\
  \ Army Staff Lt. General Sawar Khan, Lt. General Ghulam Jilani Khan, Makhdoom Sajjad\

  \ after Taseer\u2019s assanination, Latif Khosa, Makhdoom Ahmed Mahmood, Chaudhary\
  \ Muhammad Sarwar, Rana Iqbal and Rafique Rajwana.There have been a few occasions\
  \ when Punjab was administratively controlled by Governors only. These were the\
  \ times of the Martial Laws of 1958-1972 and 1977-1985, and Governor Rules of 1999-2002.\
  \ In the case of Punjab, there was direct governor rule in 1949-1951, when the provincial\
  \ chief minister of that time was removed and assemblies were dissolved. Very few\
  \ people would know that covered by lush-green sprawling lawns, the Governor's House\
  \ Lahore was build around the tomb of Mohammed Kasim Khan (died 1635), a cousin\
  \ of the Mughal emperor Akbar. Kasim Khan, as chronicles of history reveal, was\
  \ a great patron of sports, and near his grave is a \"kushtee gumbaz\" or the dome\
  \ of the wrestlers.The famous \"Darbar Hall\" of the Governor's House Lahore found\
  \ its name after the Prince of Wales wanted to hold a darbar (open public court)\
  \ here. Hence, a magnificent room with a high oak ceiling and a balustrade balcony\
  \ running all round was built for the British Prince to hold a court. The balcony\
  \ of the \"Darbar Hall\" at Governor's House Lahore still has painted portraits\
  \ of the British administrators of Lahore."

text: "State and religion\n                            A pressing question facing\
  \ today\u2019s Pakistan is the relationship between religion and the state. Should\
  \ the state be subordinate to religion? Should religion be subordinate to the state?\
  \ Or should the two be separate?Subordinating the state to religion means making\
  \ political as well as economic and cultural institutions primarily an instrument\
  \ of the propagation and enforcement of a particular creed. Such a view makes the\
  \ state an ideological entity existing solely to serve a religious purpose.On the\
  \ contrary, making religion subservient to the state means that religion, like other\
  \ social institutions, is an instrument to protect and advance state interest \u2013\
  \ generally described as national interest. The profession of a creed may be prohibited\
  \ in the interest of the dominant political ideology or narrative.Keeping the state\
  \ and religion separate means that neither would the state prescribe or promote,\
  \ nor would public resources be used, in the service of a particular creed. Neither\
  \ would the followers of a specific faith be accorded preferential treatment nor\
  \ would those professing other creeds be discriminated against. The state would\
  \ be secular \u2013 without an official dogma or religion.Every polity has to answer\
  \ this question one way or another with far-reaching socio-political implications.\
  \ How has our society answered this question? To understand this, let\u2019s go\
  \ back to the genesis of the country.The partition of British India was done on\
  \ the basis of religion; there was no other ground: linguistic, ethnic, racial,\
  \ or geographic. Muslim majority regions made up Pakistan \u2013 the rest went to\
  \ India. But what precisely was the purpose of the creation of Pakistan? Was it\
  \ to put in place an \u2018Islamic\u2019 state in the narrow sense of the term?\
  \ Or was it to safeguard the political, economic and cultural rights of the Muslims\
  \ \u2018endangered\u2019 in a united India?To date, opinion has remained sharply\
  \ divided on such questions. The founders of the country, who on their part were\
  \ liberal and westernised if not secular as well, did from time to time make statements\
  \ on the raison d\u2019\xEAtre of what at that time was the largest Muslim state\
  \ on the map of the world. But they were not always consistent \u2013 and understandably\
  \ so. Even if they were consistent, the controversy might not have been sorted out.The\
  \ first real test came when the Constituent Assembly began to draw up the first\
  \ constitution of the country. One of the causes behind the inordinate delay in\
  \ constitution making was the debate on the place religion would hold in the political\
  \ system. The present constitution of Pakistan, following the previous basic laws\
  \ of the land, has sought to answer the question of the state-religion relationship\
  \ by making Islam the state religion and incorporating some other Islamic provisions.\
  \ For instance: Both the president and prime minister have to be Muslim; principles\
  \ of democracy, tolerance, freedom, equality, and justice, as enunciated by Islam,\
  \ shall be fully observed in the country; Muslims shall be enabled to fashion their\
  \ lives as per Islamic teachings; and no law will be made, or continue to be in\
  \ force, which is in conflict with the canons of Islam.At the same time, the constitution\
  \ guarantees religious freedom by giving every citizen the right to \u2018profess,\
  \ practise and promote his religion\u2019. But has the state-religion relationship\
  \ question been adequately answered?Pakistan remains an overwhelmingly Muslim society.\
  \ So on the face of it, making Islam the state religion seems quite logical. But\
  \ within Muslims there are sects and sub-sects having deep, and at some points irreconcilable,\
  \ doctrinal differences. Not only that, there are progressive and retrogressive,\
  \ liberal and narrow, modern and primitive, forward-looking and reactionary interpretations\
  \ of Islam. So in case religion is given a paramount place in the polity, the first\
  \ question is which creed or interpretation should reign supreme. One may refer\
  \ here to the report authored by the late Justice Munir Ahmed on the 1953 Punjab\
  \ disturbances occasioned by a religious movement, which led to the imposition of\
  \ martial law in the province. The Munir Report, as it is commonly called, on the\
  \ basis of the author\u2019s dialogues with some leading Muslim clerics of different\
  \ sects, notes that they can\u2019t even agree on the definition of a Muslim. Here\
  \ is a passage from the report: \u201CThe net result of all this is that neither\
  \ Shias nor Sunnis nor Deobandis nor Ahl-e-Hadith nor Barelvis are Muslims, and\
  \ any change from one view to the other must be accompanied in an Islamic state\
  \ with the penalty of death, if the government of the state is in the hands of the\
  \ party which considers the other party to be kafirs. And it does not require much\
  \ imagination to judge the consequences of this doctrine, when it is remembered\
  \ that no two ulema have agreed before us as to the definition of a Muslim...\u201D\
  Not surprisingly, a Deobandi is reluctant to offer prayers led by a Barelvi. A Shia\
  \ hesitates to go to a mosque that is run by Sunnis.By the same token, the social\
  \ values of Islam are susceptible to a variety of interpretations. Take, for example,\
  \ justice. Does it consist in expeditious trial of the accused followed by on-the-spot\
  \ punishment in case of conviction, as touted by the exponents of the jirga system\
  \ as well as the Taliban? Or does justice lie in following the lengthy due process\
  \ of law, as represented by the formal judicial system? What is the Islamic concept\
  \ of democracy? We follow essentially the Westminster model of parliamentary democracy\
  \ but our parliament is called \u2018Majlis-e-Shura,\u2019 which is at best a consultative\
  \ forum and not a supreme legislature. On a retrogressive interpretation, parliamentary\
  \ democracy, based on majority vote and party system, is \u2018un-Islamic\u2019\
  . On a liberal interpretation, there is no inherent contradiction between the two.Are\
  \ Islam and pluralism mutually compatible or exclusive? If they are compatible,\
  \ a variety of creeds can co-exist with full religious freedom and reciprocal toleration.\
  \ If they are mutually exclusive, only one creed is entitled to exist and the rest\
  \ should either be converted or wiped out, not simply as a matter of policy but\
  \ as a religious obligation. This is what the Taliban ideology, of which a significant\
  \ section of our society is enamoured, essentially is. The Taliban kill in the name\
  \ of God.By making Islam the official religion, the state has taken upon itself\
  \ the task of making people good Muslims. But who is a good Muslim? Is it he who\
  \ prays five times a day but has no qualms about murdering those who do not measure\
  \ up to his standards of a good Muslim? Is it he who earns his or her living by\
  \ hard work? Or is it he who is compassionate and kind to his fellows irrespective\
  \ of their creed?More than 97 percent of Pakistanis are Muslims; Muslims also occupy\
  \ key slots in government, business and industry. So Islam has never been in danger\
  \ in Pakistan. But religious extremism, coming from Muslims and not non-Muslims\
  \ and feeding on a diabolical ideology, is eating into society. It is time we pondered\
  \ where we went wrong in establishing our state-religion relationship.The writer\

text: "Establishment of military courts challenged\n                            Karachi\
  \ The establishment of the proposed military courts was challenged in the Supreme\
  \ Court on Wednesday by a non-government organisation. Petitioner Altaf Shakoor,\
  \ president of PASBAN, stated in his application that after the Peshawar killings\
  \ the government\u2019s decision to set up military courts when anti-terrorism courts\
  \ were also working for the same purpose. He said the only reason cited by the government\
  \ for setting up military courts was the \u201Cincrease in terrorist activities\u201D\
  \ though police and other law-enforcement agencies had failed to protect the lives\
  \ of citizens and control the law and order situation. The petitioner stated that\
  \ the personnel of police and other law-enforcement agencies were not trained like\
  \ the armed forces in dealing with terrorists. He said it was necessary to train\
  \ law-enforcement personnel effectively so that they act against criminal elements\
  \ send them to courts for punishment. He said the government instead of removing\
  \ deficiencies in the police and law-enforcement agencies had resorted to inducting\
  \ military courts supervised by army personnel and such action was tantamount to\
  \ running a parallel judicial system in the country which was not only a violation\
  \ of the constitution but was also lethal for the democratic system. He said the\
  \ role of law-enforcement agencies in arresting culprits involved in terrorism used\
  \ to criticise unfair treatment and false implication of citizens due to political\

  \     ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghanistan will kickstart negotiations to sign Preferential\
  \ Trade Agreement (PTA) in Islamabad from Thursday, January 1, 2015, in order to\
  \ jack up the bilateral trade up to $5 billion over the next three years, official\

  \ two-day deliberations in which Islamabad will make efforts to maximise its exports\
  \ in cement, agriculture products by seeking reduction in duty and taxes to Afghanistan,\u201D\
  \ the official sources said on Wednesday.Pakistan\u2019s exports of cement to Afghanistan\
  \ are witnessing declining trend in the recent months as Kabul is importing the\
  \ commodity from Iran.There are two factors involved in the decline in cement exports\
  \ to Afghanistan, as construction-related work is decreasing and Iranian brand of\
  \ cement is penetrating in the Afghan market, the sources said.\u201CIn order to\
  \ get our due share, Pakistan will seek waiver in duty and tariff structure on exports\
  \ of cement, as currently there is 10 percent duty on our exports, an official said.The\
  \ Afghan authorities will also demand starting negotiations on the revision of Afghanistan-Pakistan\
  \ Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) within 2015, as this agreement would exhaust after\
  \ five years.In 2003, India and Afghanistan had signed PTA that resulted in boosting\
  \ trade ties between the two countries.Now, Pakistan will also make efforts to sign\
  \ PTA with Afghanistan where Kabul would seek scaling down of the duty structure\
  \ on fresh and dry fruits.Pakistan had already granted such incentive to China and\
  \ other neighbouring countries so there was no harm in granting the same facility\
  \ to Afghanistan, the official added.When contacted, Federal Commerce Secretary\
  \ Muhammad Shehzad Arbab said the Pakistani side would submit its draft PTA to the\
  \ Afghan side and would seek their comments in order to boost trade ties between\
  \ the two countries.He said Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan would hold deliberations\
  \ on signing trilateral transit agreement on January 3 in Islamabad with clear cut\
  \ timeframe to move towards signing this agreement. However, the sources said the\
  \ APTTA will cease to exist after the lapse of five years in the coming few months.\
  \ The existing APTTA agreement states it will remain in force for five years from\
  \ the date it comes into force. The APTTA illustrates this agreement will automatically\
  \ renewed for a further period of five years thereafter subject to such modification\
  \ as may be agreed upon unless terminated by either contracting party.Pakistan desires\
  \ to include Tajikistan in APTTA after the lapse of this existing agreement with\
  \ effect from October 28, 2015.In the aftermath of the signing of APTTA between\
  \ Afghanistan and Pakistan in the last five years, the commercial trade (transit\
  \ and bilateral trade) and noncommercial (NATO-related trade) showed fluctuating\
  \ trends, as in the fiscal year 2009/10 the total trade was recorded at $3.332 billion\
  \ with the share of commercial trade ($2.157 billion) and noncommercial trade ($1.165\
  \ billion). In the fiscal year 2010/11, the commercial trade was recorded at $1.871\
  \ billion and noncommercial trade at $11.65 million. The commercial trade was recorded\
  \ at $1.256 billion in 2011/12 and noncommercial trade at $525 million, $1.319 billion\
  \ commercial trade and noncommercial of $564 million in 2012/13 and $2.202 billion\

text: "A capital storm\n                            A near-perfect storm is now swirling\
  \ around capital punishment in Pakistan where a seven-year old moratorium has recently\
  \ been lifted in the wake of the Peshawar tragedy. The EU is against the decision,\
  \ being an ardent supporter of abolishing capital punishment globally. In accordance\
  \ with a 2008 report, 137 countries had abolished death penalty in law or in practice\
  \ while the US, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan retained it and accounted\
  \ for 88 percent of the world\u2019s executions.In an indirect manner, some political\
  \ parties in the country are also whipping up opposition through objections to the\
  \ government\u2019s current efforts to institute military courts through an amendment\
  \ to the constitution for speedy justice. It is not difficult to see that such resistance\
  \ is not so much out of deference to human rights or any consideration for the constitution\
  \ of Pakistan, but out of fear that a combination of speedy trials and lifting of\
  \ moratorium would adversely affect their politics which so far have had a strong\
  \ streak of violence.The EU position is understandable; it saw Pakistan as a country\
  \ on the \u2018cusp\u2019 of abolishing the death penalty when former president\
  \ Asif Ali Zardari imposed a ban on executions in 2008. Recent developments have\
  \ reversed that status. The EU had invested much effort with the Zardari regime\
  \ through political arm twisting through the European Instrument for Democracy and\
  \ Human Right (EIDHR), matched by its mechanism of funding through the European\
  \ Commission. But Zardari was confused; on the one hand the government was imposing\
  \ a moratorium on capital punishment and at the same time promulgating the Prevention\
  \ of Electronic Crimes Ordinance which included \u2018cyber terrorism\u2019 in the\
  \ list of offences warranting the death penalty.In countries where the death penalty\
  \ situation is still in flux, EU has been striving for adherence to minimum international\
  \ standards \u2013 imposing capital punishment only for the most serious intentional\
  \ and violent crimes, not imposing it on anyone less than eighteen years of age,\
  \ pregnant women, new mothers, or persons with mental disorder. The standard requires\
  \ a fair trial where the defendant benefits from legal assistance and has recourse\
  \ to an appeal process. Also every endeavour is made that there is minimum possible\
  \ suffering while carrying out the punishment. But it has taken centuries for Europe\u2019\
  s civilisation to arrive at a stage where as a society it considers the death sentence\
  \ to be cruel, inhuman and irreversible and would like to abolish it for the sake\
  \ of human dignity and progressive development of human rights. Also historically\
  \ Europe has used a whole range of very painful methods to inflict death on convicted\
  \ prisoners which are too gory to be narrated here.It is audacious to think how\
  \ a punishment that snuffs out life out of an otherwise perfectly healthy body,\
  \ can be termed as causing less suffering than another, but certainly there is a\
  \ difference between hangings as per Pakistan\u2019s jail manuals which bring life\
  \ to a sudden end as opposed to some of the seemingly sophisticated methods in the\
  \ west. Earlier this year, Dennis McGuire, who was administered a lethal injection\
  \ in an Ohio jail writhed in acute and miserable pain for nearly fifteen minutes\
  \ before breathing his last.It is also interesting to note that in the past, most\
  \ of the offences for which the death sentence was awarded in Europe, were minor\
  \ compared to today\u2019s standards. It is only through a process of evolution\
  \ that the public mind in Europe accepts interning a mass killer like the Norwegian\
  \ Anders Breivik on an island for 21 years as punishment for killing 77 innocent\
  \ lives in 2011 \u2013 the highest in Norway for such offences \u2013 just over\
  \ three months for every person killed. Indeed life couldn\u2019t come have cheaper\
  \ in a society where it is otherwise so valued. Pakistan is relatively a nascent\
  \ state on the timeline of global civilisation. It inherited English jurisprudence\
  \ tailored to serve the purposes of erstwhile colonial masters when it came into\
  \ existence. Under the best of circumstances, we are never a very stable society\
  \ and governments of every hue have been found struggling to keep the crime rate\
  \ to a manageable level. Historically, the death sentence has never reduced the\
  \ crime rate to zero but it has helped lower it. Towards that end, capital punishment\
  \ in Pakistan had an element of fear for would-be offenders and acts as deterrence.\
  \ Over time, as societal turbulence increased, the number of offences punishable\
  \ by death has also risen but in spite of the heinous nature of the crime in some\
  \ cases, Pakistan has never violated the minimum international standards. Successive\
  \ governments, except for a brief period during General Ziaul Haq\u2019s rule, have\
  \ also kept capital punishments out of public view despite public pressure as is\
  \ being witnessed these days.The social fabric of today\u2019s Pakistan has been\
  \ ripped apart by a process started decades ago by former President Ronald Reagan\
  \ when he chose to fight the \u2018evil empire\u2019 in Afghanistan by dusting off\
  \ the concept of armed Islamic jihad and employing it as a weapon in the game between\
  \ superpowers. Terrorism refuses to die as was witnessed in Peshawar recently. That\
  \ element of fear which was meant for would-be offenders through the death penalty\
  \ has struck deep into the hearts of our mothers, sisters and children and has made\
  \ normal life impossible. This fear has to be taken out of our people and put back\
  \ into the hearts of those who perpetuate such heinous crimes. The citizens of Pakistan\
  \ deserve some peace of mind and if it is through capital punishments, let it be\
  \ so. A guiding principle for capital punishment enunciated by Prophet Muhammad\
  \ (pbuh) mentions only three offences \u2013 murder, illegal sexual intercourse\
  \ committed by a married person and apostasy. Pakistan\u2019s penal code, however,\
  \ prescribes death sentence for 27 different crimes which can perhaps be reviewed\
  \ downward in deference to global sentiments on the issue especially where crime\
  \ has been checked effectively. But any outright move to abolish capital punishment\
  \ will not only aggravate the law and order situation but also be a breach of the\
  \ country\u2019s constitution which declares that no law shall be enacted against\
  \ Islamic injunctions as stipulated in the Quran and Sunnah.The former chief justice\
  \ was recently asked why the conviction rate in the anti-terrorist courts was so\
  \ low to which he responded by admitting that when evidence falls short, the courts\
  \ have no option but to let the accused go free. This is a perfectly legal approach\
  \ but the question honourable judges should be asking themselves is whether doing\
  \ so always serves the ends of justice. Would justice be better served if in an\
  \ odd case of huge public interest, and where the judge is convinced beyond any\
  \ shadow of doubt that evidence has been intentionally left patchy during investigation\
  \ under pressure from the powerful, the judgements are in response to public expectations\
  \ and not a computerised outcome of the arguments in the courts?That said, the real\
  \ issue we should be looking at is that, as far as possible, no innocent should\
  \ be deprived of his life due to miscarriage of justice. Our existing legal system\
  \ is highly flawed where self-confessed criminals of major crimes roam about freely\
  \ and the innocent get punished. The EU would therefore do well to channel its EIDHR\
  \ support, complemented by European Commission funding, towards bringing about much-needed\
  \ jurisprudence infrastructure reforms in Pakistan rather than focusing on the moratorium\
  \ on the death penalty.The writer is a retired vice admiral. Email: [email\_protected]"

text: "Land record couldn\u2019t be computerised in 2014\n                       \
  \     LAHORETHE dream of completing a historical World Bank funded land record computerisation\
  \ project could not come true in the year 2014 despite tall claims made by Punjab\
  \ Chief Minister Mian Shahbaz Sharif in the said context. The first deadline to\
  \ complete the historical project was set for June 2014 and later December 2014\
  \ by the CM but computerisation of the land record could only be completed in 20\
  \ districts including Kasur, Sheikhupura, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Nankana Sahib,\
  \ Jhang, Jhelum, Lodhran, and Lahore out of total 36 districts of the province.\
  \ Similarly, around 12,500 muzaz out of total 23,000 were computerised in the year\
  \ 2014 in comparison with 2,500 muzaz which were completed in the year 2013. Besides\
  \ this, Arazi Record Centres have also been established in 143 tehsils of the province\
  \ during 2014 to provide further benefit to the masses. Now the project is expected\
  \ to be completed by June 2015. In those districts where the new system has started\
  \ working, any citizen can get the record of his piece of land in just 30 minutes\
  \ while transfer record can be made available within 50 minutes only. The computerisation\
  \ of land record has also made the process of getting \u2018Fard\u2019 more friendly\
  \ and the legal fee of Fard has also been reduced to Rs 150. It is expected that\
  \ when this modern system became fully functional in all the districts of the province,\
  \ the culture of corruption, bribery and forgery in the matters related to land\
  \ would be eliminated and the people would get rid of exploitative system of Patwaris\
  \ and Tehsildars. Due to computerisation of land record, the threat of theft and\
  \ loss of documents in fire or flood will also be minimised. It is pertinent to\
  \ mention here that the project \u2018Land Record Computerisation\u2019 was initiated\
  \ by Ch Pervaiz Elahi as a pilot project. The aim of the project was to get rid\
  \ the province of corrupt practices and irregularities of Patwaris and other revenue\
  \ officers. The project moved ahead very slowly every year. Designed by the Project\
  \ Management Unit, the project was recommended to the World Bank Board for funding\
  \ in 2006 and subsequently the Project Financing Agreement was signed on February\
  \ 28, 2007. During the previous era of incumbent PML-N\u2019s provincial government,\
  \ nothing tangible work could be done on the project and the project was delayed\
  \ further mainly because of delay in the software development and selection process\
  \ which was expected to be completed by the end of 2008. Similarly, implementation\
  \ of the project in four districts of the province, to be initiated in 2009, got\
  \ delayed. After the software development, the work on computerising the land record\
  \ got underway in the Punjab to facilitate more than 20 million land owners of the\
  \ province. To expand the Land Record Management Information Systems project in\
  \ the entire Punjab by CM Shahbaz Sharif was the other reason for the delay in the\
  \ completion of the project as initially the project was to be implemented in only\
  \ half of the districts of the province. Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad\
  \ Shahbaz Sharif presided over a high level meeting on Wednesday which reviewed\
  \ in detail the progress of the Land Record Management Information System. According\
  \ to a handout issued on Wednesday, addressing the meeting, the chief minister said\
  \ that the land record computerisation service centres had been made operational\
  \ in all the 143 tehsils of the province. He said through the computerisation of\
  \ land record issuance of proprietary deed had been ensured within 30 minutes which\
  \ would provide substantial relief to citizens as well as rid them of obsolete Patwar\
  \ Culture. He said the computerisation of land record had been completed in 20 districts\
  \ and online system at 92 service centres had been linked with a consolidated system.\
  \ He further said the process of Google mapping with regard to land had been completed\
  \ in three districts. The CM directed that the programme of Google mapping of the\
  \ land be extended to the whole province and an effective awareness campaign be\
  \ initiated regarding the importance of the project. He appreciated institutions\
  \ and authorities concerned over a speedy progress on the project and said it was\
  \ a public welfare project which would directly benefit the masses. The chief minister\
  \ issued instructions for setting up a steering committee to be headed by Member\
  \ Punjab Assembly Rana Sana Ullah and directed that the committee should submit\
  \ recommendations within seven days after reviewing matters pertaining to the launching\
  \ of the project of computerisation of urban land record, restriction on consolidation,\
  \ setting up of an authority with regard to permanent monitoring of the Land Record\
  \ Management Information System and other matters. The chairman planning and development\
  \ gave a detailed briefing on the pace of the project. Provincial Minister for Law\
  \ Mujtaba Shuja-ur-Rehman, Assembly Members Najaf Abbas Sial, Rana Sana Ullah, Dr.\
  \ Ayesha Ghous Pasha, Mian Tariq Mehmood, Qamar-ul-Islam, chief secretary, senior\
  \ member, board of revenue, chairman planning and development and officers concerned\
  \ were also present."

  \ Division, according to Khawaja Zaheer Ahmed, special assistant to the prime minister.\

  \ for choosing a panel of suitable candidates for heading these institutions. The\

  \ submitting a report in this regard.Khawaja Zaheer Ahmed, head of the committee\
  \ constituted by the government for the appointment of heads of public sector enterprises,\
  \ while talking to The News said that the committee has completed the assigned task.\
  \ \u201CThe committee finalised its task today (Wednesday) and sent the report to\
  \ Establishment Division which would further proceed as per the court\u2019s verdict.\
  \ Out of 53 remaining PSEs only four companies i.e. Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Oil\
  \ and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL)\
  \ and Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) have asked for reviewing their panel\
  \ of candidates and sought some time which the committee granted,\u201D said Khawaja\
  \ Zaheer.The committee comprised former secretary law Barrister Zafrullah Khan,\
  \ Muhammad Zubair, secretary Establishment Division, secretary Cabinet Division\
  \ and the secretary of the relevant ministry.\u201CAfter reviewing the commission\u2019\
  s work and sensitivity of the matter, the committee in its initial report to the\
  \ government recommended that all the state-run enterprises which are being run\
  \ without a regular head should be given free hand to choose a suitable panel of\
  \ candidates to head them. We have told them to bring the panel of names to the\
  \ committee and then the committee would decide about the finalists and recommend\

  \ the ministry used to send three names to the prime minister. However now the departments\
  \ concerned and ministries would bring these names to the committee and committee\
  \ would review them after which it would present its recommendations to the prime\
  \ minister.When asked about the reason for delay in the appointment process as the\
  \ government could appoint only five heads of the institutions so far, he said the\
  \ commission delayed the process as it failed to fulfill its task.\u201CThe commission\
  \ was fully authorised and was given a free hand but it failed as it could not hold\
  \ its meetings regularly. Due to the failure of the commission, the government has\
  \ to face criticism,\u201D he remarked.  He said the committee has made it clear\
  \ to all these institutions that they could re-advertise the positions if they want\
  \ to include eligible candidates in the list. However the final decision would be\
  \ taken by the committee after scrutinising the list of candidates.Five of 58 state-run\

  \ potable water, proper sanitation facilities and healthy environment to Sindh\u2019\
  s people would be implemented in letter and spirit.When asked to comment on Karachi\
  \ Mayor Wasim Akhtar\u2019s demand that the KWSB, the SBCA, the KDA and the master\
  \ plan department should be under the mayor, the LG minister said that such a demand\
  \ can only be met through amendments by the Sindh Assembly in the LG law.He said\
  \ the mayor can demand all he wants, but he has to seek the help of the provincial\
  \ legislature to have them met, adding that before making any demands, the mayor\
  \ should take a look at his performance.Ghani listed the deplorable conditions of\
  \ the city\u2019s parks and hospitals as well as the roads and streets that are\
  \ strewn with garbage as Akhtar\u2019s failings. He said the KMC is unable to generate\
  \ revenue, which shows how poorly the body is performing, so before criticising\
  \ the Sindh government, one should take a look at their own performance. The mayor\
  \ is unable to stop the rampant corruption in the KMC, added the minister.Ghani\
  \ asked what Akhtar and his Muttahida Qaumi Movement had achieved as regards the\
  \ Karachi Building Control Authority and the KWSB when his then party colleague\
  \ Mustafa Kamal was the city mayor.The minister said the provincial government gives\
  \ them Rs500 million a month to disburse salaries and the chief minister has provided\
  \ them with development funds. He asked if the mayor can show any development project\
  \ or other work on which these funds have been spent.Responding to a question regarding\
  \ the mayor\u2019s renewed demand of CM Syed Murad Ali Shah to provide him with\
  \ authority and funds, Ghani said Akhtar already has all the powers under the Sindh\
  \ Local Government Ordinance 2013.The minister said the people keep complaining\
  \ to him about the deplorable conditions of roads and streets across the city where\
  \ heaps of garbage have been dumped.He said that when the KMC had failed to lift\
  \ garbage and sought the help of Bahria Town Chairman Malik Riaz, he had helped\
  \ only because of former Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari, as he had quoted in\
  \ his speech that Zardari is his close friend and had asked him to help lift garbage\
  \ from District Central.A day earlier Ghani had rejected the claim of opposition\
  \ political parties that the provincial government\u2019s figure of offal removal\
  \ was exaggerated, and reiterated that 41,980 tonnes of sacrificial animal remains\
  \ were lifted and disposed of by Karachi\u2019s municipal agencies during the three\
  \ days of Eidul Azha.Addressing a news conference at the media cell of the Pakistan\
  \ Peoples Party, he said that around a million animals were sacrificed this Eidul\
  \ Azha across the metropolis in the areas that do not fall under the jurisdiction\
  \ of the different cantonment boards.Ghani said that according to the results of\
  \ the latest population census, Karachi comprises about three million families.\
  \ \u201CSome 33 per cent of the families living in the city sacrificed animals this\
  \ time, and the number of animals whose offal we lifted corresponds to this estimate.\u201D\
  He said that those with objections over the government\u2019s figure should object\
  \ to similar statistics of other cities. He added that some 44,000 tonnes of remains\
  \ were lifted in Lahore, so it is implausible that around 66 per cent of the families\
  \ living in Pakistan\u2019s second largest city sacrificed animals.The minister\
  \ said that in Peshawar around 9,500 tonnes of remains were allegedly disposed of,\
  \ meaning that up to 97 per cent of the families living in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019\
  s capital sacrificed animals.\u201CAccording to [Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Karachi\
  \ chief] Firdous Shamim Naqvi, the city\u2019s people sacrificed fewer animals than\
  \ the offal lifted. So, instead of questioning our very plausible figure, he should\
  \ challenge the number of Peshawar.\u201DGhani advised the leaders of the opposition\
  \ Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) that instead of embroiling themselves in an undue\
  \ controversy, they should at least check with the Central District Municipal Corporation\
  \ (DMC) chairman, who is affiliated with their own party.The minister said that\
  \ according to the figure provided by the Central DMC, some 437,000 animals were\
  \ sacrificed in District Central alone. He asked MQM leader Khawaja Izharul Hassan\
  \ to inquire about it from his party\u2019s local government representatives.Ghani\
  \ thanked the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar, chairmen\
  \ of the different DMCs, the Karachi District Council, other municipal agencies\
  \ and local government employees for their respective roles in the operation to\
  \ lift and dispose of offal and other remains of sacrificial animals.He claimed\
  \ that barring a few areas, the operation had been completed. He said that there\
  \ were a few complaints regarding the clean-up operation, but the overall sanitary\
  \ situation remained promising and would be improved further."
