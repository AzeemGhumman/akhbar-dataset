text: "London mayor Sadiq questions Imran\u2019s support for Zac Goldsmith\nLONDON:\
  \ Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said that former cricket star and PTI Chairman\
  \ Imran Khan should explain why he openly supported Zac Goldsmith during the recent\
  \ bitter London mayoral election campaign, which saw the former winning the biggest\
  \ ever personal mandate in British political history.\nIn his first exclusive interview\
  \ to any Pakistani and South Asian media outlet on Thursday, Sadiq Khan told Geo\
  \ News that Imran Khan\u2019s open endorsement for Zac Goldsmith came as a surprise\
  \ to him.\nThe London mayor said: \u201CImran Khan should explain why he supported\
  \ Zac Goldsmith. When I was little, Imran Khan was my hero. He used to be one of\
  \ the best all-rounders \u2013 1982 and 1987 series were very good, then the world\
  \ cup in 1992. It is sad [that he supported Zac] but this is for IK to answer and\
  \ not me.\u201D\nSadiq Khan, the Labour victor and former cabinet minister under\
  \ Tony Blair, outstripped Boris Johnson's 2008 record to win a landslide 1,310,143\
  \ votes in his race to be Mayor of London, beating his Tory rival Zac Goldsmith\
  \ by nearly half a million votes.\nThe toxic election campaign saw Zac Goldsmith\
  \ branding Sadiq Khan an \u2018extremist, terrorist sympathiser, unsafe, closet\
  \ radical and a threat to Britain\u2019s national security.\u2019 Zac Goldsmith\u2019\
  s attack on sadiq Khan was so racist and Islamophobic that former Tory cabinet minister\
  \ and party leader Sayeeda Warsi openly condemned Zac Goldsmith.\nSadiq Khan told\
  \ this scribe that it was unfortunate that Zac Goldsmith failed on all policies\
  \ and tried to scare off voters by telling that Sadiq Khan is of Pakistani origin\
  \ and Muslim therefore he shouldn\u2019t be trusted.\nSadiq Khan said that he has\
  \ multiple identities and he\u2019s proud of all his identities including his Pakistani\
  \ origin and Muslim faith.\n\u201CCurrently, Pakistan's reputation is not so good.\
  \ My opponents said to people that I come from Pakistan, that I'm a Muslim. The\
  \ interesting thing is that I admitted all this myself: Yes! I am from Pakistan.\
  \ Yes! I'm a Muslim \u2013 but I have policies, values ideas to be the best mayor.\
  \ And I'll be a mayor for all of London, whether the people are Muslims, Christians,\
  \ Jews, Sikhs or Hindus, Buddhists or atheists, I'll still be your mayor.\u201D\n\
  Sadiq Khan accepted that the fight for the second most important job in Britain\
  \ was very tough. He said that his parents taught him how to fight for values and\
  \ be strong in face of odds. He said he couldn\u2019t be where he is today if it\
  \ was not for the values instilled in him by his parents.\n\u201CMy background and\
  \ my values come from my parents. They originate from Pakistan and they're a source\
  \ of pride for me. I always source back to my religion, Islam. If you can help others,\
  \ you can. Don\u2019t be arrogant, don\u2019t be vain. If you get an opportunity,\
  \ then explain to people what type of a country Pakistan is, and what type of a\
  \ religion Islam is. This was my thinking. I am proud of who I am and I have every\
  \ reason to take pride in my being and my values.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that he\
  \ was supported by people of all faiths and people of no faith. \u201CMy victory\
  \ is everyone's victory. The support I received in the shape of campaigning, finance\
  \ and prayers was absolutely fantastic. And we showed the world that London is the\
  \ best city in the world,\u201D he added.\nSadiq Khan told Geo News that he was\
  \ aware that his victory was celebrated across Pakistan and people prayed for his\
  \ victory and held celebrations when he was declared a victor.\n\u201CI received\
  \ messages from friends and supporters about the pride that was felt in Pakistan.\
  \ My parents, grandparents are from Pakistan, my family is still there so I feel\
  \ proud, I feel humbled, and this is a responsibility to show London that a man\
  \ from an Islamic background and Pakistani heritage can help business, can build\
  \ the homes, can fix the transport.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that Tory election campaign\
  \ was negative and counter-productive and it was clear that the Lonodoners rejected\
  \ their message of division and hatred.\n\u201CThe Conservative campaign was extremely\
  \ negative, divisive and desperate. People were doubted about whether it is possible\
  \ for London to choose a mayor and have security around other issues. The support\
  \ we received was fantastic. The biggest ever turnout in election, the biggest vote\
  \ to the winning candidate and we've shown the world that we're the best city in\
  \ the world. And I thank all your viewers (of Geo News) for the best wishes after\
  \ elections. I received lots of messages after May 5. I am deeply thankful to all\
  \ those people. I am very busy at the moment and I can\u2019t thank everyone in\
  \ person but I know their sentiments and value them.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that\
  \ it was a sad fact that the \u201Creputation of our religion Islam is not good\
  \ these days\u201D. He said many people in the world think that all Muslims are\
  \ terrorists and extremists. \u201CSo if we can show them that we're peaceful, law-abiding\
  \ and that we're capable of keeping everyone safe, then the reputation of Islam\
  \ will improve.\u201D\nKhan has said he is not a Muslim leader, not a spokesperson\
  \ of Islam and not the representative of Muslims but he had made it clear that he\u2019\
  s a practicing Muslim and observes Ramazan.\nHe told Geo News that fasting for 19\
  \ hours a day in the UK is not an easy task especially when there\u2019s a round\
  \ the clock job to do at the City Hall but he said that Islam is all about making\
  \ sacrifices and overcoming the self, for others.\n\u201CIt is difficult to fast\
  \ for 19 hours. I engage in a lot of speeches, media, TV and public debating. Fasting\
  \ is a sacrifice and this is a month of charity. And this is my humility. I know\
  \ a lot of people in London are hungry. 100,000 people last year used a food bank.\
  \ So fasting allows me to have solidarity with these hungry, poor people.\n\u201C\
  There is a reason fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. If you're a Muslim,\
  \ and you can fast, then that's great. Another positive thing is that non-Muslims\
  \ are now learning about Islam, about fasting. They ask me \u201Chow are you doing\
  \ this? How is the fasting going?\" I think this is a good thing that they're beginning\
  \ to understand our religion.\u201D\n\u2018Ignorant Trump needs to understand Islam\u2019\
  \nSadiq Khan condemned US politician Donald Trump for helping extremist groups such\
  \ as Daesh by announcing a ban on all Muslims from entering the United States.\n\
  \u201CExtremists say that western values and Islam is incompatible \u2013 that you\
  \ cannot be a Muslim if you're western. They're both different. Donald Trump is\
  \ saying the same: that you cannot be western if you're a Muslim. He proposed a\
  \ ban on Muslims from entering USA. After my victory, he announced that he'd make\
  \ an exception for Sadiq Khan.\n\u201CMy answer is this: I am not an exception.\
  \ Why are you making an exception for me? There are law-abiding Muslims in England\
  \ and London and Europe and all around the world who want to go America. They're\
  \ peaceful, they're law-abiding. Donald trump is basically doing ISIS' work for\
  \ them by preaching their message of either Westernism or Islam.\u201D\nThe London\
  \ mayor said that Donald Trump was an ignorant man who needed to broaden his horizons\
  \ and understanding of Islam.\n\u201CI say that Trump is an idiot. He doesn\u2019\
  t understand Islam, and it is our duty to make him understand that this is not what\
  \ Muslims or Islam is about. And in America there are Americans who are Muslims\
  \ working and living peacefully.\u201D\nSadiq Khan outlined his plan of dealing\
  \ with extremism by supporting the police and security agencies in effectively tacking\
  \ with this menace and by rooting out hate preaching. He said that the biggest worry\
  \ was that it needed only one terrorist to succeed in his mission of causing mayhem\
  \ and terror. He said the fact that many young Muslims, including many women, went\
  \ to Syria from the UK to join ISIS, was a worry and must be dealt with.\n\u201C\
  It is a big worry. London is a great city. Intervention has to be more resilient\
  \ to this preaching of hate. There is a motive to close down those websites that\
  \ are encouraging people to go astray. There have been moves to closing down certain\
  \ accounts and stopping things which encourage people to join terror groups. So\
  \ we have a responsibility to ensure that young people aren't led down that path.\u201D\
  \nSadiq Khan last week appeared with Prime Minister David Cameron to show support\
  \ for the \u201CIn\u201D campaign which wants UK to stay in the European Union.\
  \ Only weeks ago the PM had called Sadiq Khan an extremist in the parliament. Observes\
  \ said that it was Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory and his vindication that the British\
  \ premier stood next to him and praised him and his election mandate.\nSadiq Khan\
  \ said he believed that it was in Britain\u2019s interest to stay in the European\
  \ Union and not leave it.\n\u201CWe showed on May 5 how hope and fairness can be\
  \ used to defeat division. Jobs, export market, high street, restaurants, fashion...\
  \ market of USA, China, Japan. We need to think of consequences and remind people\
  \ of the downsides. The benefits are huge.\u201D\n\_"
