text: ' LOS ANGELES: Meryl Streep and Judi Dench   two of Hollywood s most respected
  actresses   lashed out at movie producer Harvey Weinstein on Monday but said they
  were unaware of his decades of alleged sexual harassment of women. As Hollywood
  moved to distance itself from Weinstein, Streep said she had been appalled by the
  claims made against the film studio executive she once likened to  God  in a 2012
  awards speech. His  behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,  Streep
  said a statement. Britain s Dench   who won a supporting actress Oscar in 1999 for
  the Weinstein-produced film Shakespeare in Love  said in a statement she was  completely
  unaware of these offences, which are of course horrifying . Stars like Streep and
  Dench, whose movies had been championed by Weinstein, have been under pressure to
  speak out after a New York Times investigation last week detailed claims by multiple
  women of unwanted physical contact by Weinstein over three decades. Weinstein, 65,
  initially apologized but later threatened to sue over the allegations uncovered
  by the newspaper. He has not been charged with any crimes but was fired on Sunday
  as co-chairman of the Weinstein amid fallout from the Times story. In a statement
  to the Huffington Post, Streep said she had been unaware of claims that Weinstein
  undressed in front of actresses and assistants and asked young women to give him
  massages.   The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us
  whose work he championed,  Streep said. Producer and director Kevin Smith said on
  Monday he regretted taking money from Weinstein s production company. He financed
  the first 14 years of my career   and now I know while I was profiting, others were
  in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed. https://t.co/T0hInW7EqJ   KevinSmith

  ashamed,  Smith   who s known for the comedies Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and
  Clerks,   wrote on Twitter. Actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan have said Weinstein
  sexually harassed them and movie director Judd Apatow and producer Megan Ellison
  are among those have spoken out in support of them. Weinstein is the latest US media
  or entertainment industry titan to face sexual harassment accusations. At Fox News,
  late Chief Executive Officer Roger Ailes was forced out in 2016 and anchor Bill
  O Reilly resigned in April after similar claims. More than 50 women have accused
  comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault. Cosby faces a retrial in April on the one

text: 'The dawn of  Naya Pakistan  has set in, but some things in this country remain
  unchanged. Censorship on media and crushing of dissent is in full swing and there
  does not seem to be an end to it (not anytime soon at least) because the new government
  appears to be close to the usual suspects i.e. the establishment. Last week, three
  family members of Sindhi human rights activist Sanaullah Aman were abducted from
  their house by  unidentified  men. Aman is a leading voice against enforced disappearances
  in Sindh and has been campaigning for the release of Sindh s  missing persons. In
  June this year, I interviewed him about the state of human rights in Sindh particularly
  the issue of enforced disappearances. It was shocking to learn that police officials
  refuse to file FIRs in cases involving enforced disappearances saying that the abductors
  are  more powerful  than them. When activists raise their voices against an abduction,
  the abductee is immediately declared criminal or  fugitive  by local police, allegedly
  on orders of agencies. In instances where the missing persons have returned home,
  they discontinued their activism out of fear (and understandably so). After a missing
  person is recovered there is no accountability for those who picked them up in the
  first place, and the vicious cycle continues. While we celebrate the democratic
  transition of power, it is important to be reminded that freedom of speech is one
  of the cornerstones of democracy   without which   the democratic system is in jeopardy
  Mysterious abductions are currently taking place across the country and a significant
  number of the recent victims of enforced disappearances were progressive activists.
  In a report issued in May, the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances
  claimed to have received 5,177 cases of alleged enforced disappearances since its
  inception in 2011. Enforced disappearances were previously limited to conflict-ridden
  areas such as Balochistan and the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas
  (FATA), but the practice has recently expanded to target dissenting voices across
  the country. The purpose of enforced disappearances is clear: silencing of dissent.
  With such hostility and intolerance for criticism being the norm, the space for
  alternative views has considerably shrunk over the past few years. Therefore, it
  is tough being an activist in Pakistan, especially if you are critical of the military
  s policies. Because thanks to the propaganda fed to the nation, an average Pakistani
  thinks those questioning the army s handling of affairs are enemy agents or  anti-state
  , ignoring the fact that there is nothing wrong   legally or constitutionally   with
  criticism of the armed forces. Moreover, there is little understanding among the  patriot  types
  about what the criticism of military entails because instead of understanding the
  argument put forth by the critics, the hyper-patriots are quick to doll out certificates
  of treason. For starters, when progressive activists (who are on the receiving end
  of abuse as well as violence these days) criticise the military, soldiers of Pakistan
  army who risk their lives for the country are not to whom they are referring. Flawed
  policies of generals who consider themselves above the law are the focal point of
  the aforementioned criticism directed at the military. If it weren t for these wrong
  choices, our soldiers wouldn t have needed to sacrifice their lives while fighting
  a home-grown enemy in their own country. Therefore, it is important to keep reminding
  the deep state to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. Furthermore, institutional
  overreaches and infringement of public liberties including freedom of speech are
  among the reasons why the deep state is criticised by democrats. Pakistan recently
  saw second successful transition of power from one democratically-elected government
  to another. While we celebrate this progress, it is important to be reminded that
  freedom of speech is one of the cornerstones of democracy, without which, the democratic
  system is in jeopardy. As things stand, civilians who dare to disagree with the
  military are being sidelined or silenced. What is worse is that there is little
  to no defiance in the face of the aforementioned attempts to clampdown on free speech.
  In the months leading up to the general elections, electronic and print media was
  under pressure from the powers-that-be to give limited coverage to political parties
  that are on the wrong side of the establishment. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif
  s media talks prior to his arrest in July, for instance, were heavily censored on
  electronic media. This censorship on media continues till date. News of a protest
  sit-in against security forces in Miranshah, Waziristan was blacked out by mainstream
  media. The new Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry has lifted  political censorship  from
  state-owned media and vowed to give editorial independence to Pakistan Television
  (PTV) and Radio Pakistan, which is a step in the right direction. But it is about
  time something is done to bring an end to censorship on private media as well. All
  democratic forces including senior journalists should raise their voice against
  the ongoing attacks on free speech, because a fully-controlled system is anything
  but democracy.  The writer is Assistant Editor, Daily Times. She Tweets @AiliaZehra

  saying the Punjab Overseas Pakistanis Commission (POPC) office has been closed for
  some days. The POPC turned out to be very helpful to me, slightly over a year ago.
  I had left Lahore to live in the UK, and had rented my old home to a family. Just
  a few weeks after I had settled in the UK, I found out that the people renting my
  house were refusing to pay their dues. When I called them, they spoke to me in a
  threatening tone, and rather than agreeing to move out or pay what they owed, they
  attempted to extort money from me. Upon the recommendation of a friend, I contacted
  the POPC. Not only did they take note of my problem, they successfully removed the
  family from my home and obtained the money that was owed to me. The Overseas Pakistanis
  Commission (OPC) have proven to be a blessing for Pakistanis living abroad. Sadly,
  our country has a land-grabbing and land-mafia problem, and thus the services provided
  by the OPC are very important. It should be noted that the POPC was a pet-project
  of the senior leadership of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) for the past
  five years. Therefore, considering the political rivalry between the PML-N and Pakistan
  Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), it is possible that the closure of the POPC office is politically
  motivated. I sincerely hope that the new government will not indulge in such unproductive
  actions and that the POPC office will re-open immediately. SHAHID AFZAL Bradford,

text: '  How the Hermit Kingdom Can Be Changed  President Donald Trump has ordered
  the US army to  stand ready  for the fight against North Korea. Harsh words were
  exchanged between Trump and Kim Jong Un during the UN General Assembly session and
  later Trump promised to  totally destroy  North Korea by taking military action.
  Kim Jong Un found Trump a  gangster playing with fire . Trump also criticised China
  that if China is not going to solve the North Korean issue, the United States will
  solve it. Back channels and negotiations were held between Washington and Pyongyang,
  but there was no outcome and the United States suspended secret negations with North
  Korea, calling it a  waste of time . At this stage, China was not taken as an interlocutor
  to negotiate between them. The China-North Korea tale is not as simple as it is
  frequently mentioned by leaders and analysts these days. All the tables in many
  capitals wrongly turned on China to use its leverage in resolving the North Korean
  stalemate. Beijing tries but there are certain constraints and limits and China
  understands its limits. The shadow of the Sino-Vietnamese war of 1979 also lingers
  on China s role in North Korea. Washington often undermines these Chinese limits
  on North Korea and insists on  doing more . China intervened in the Korean War in
  1950 and saved North Korea and signed the treaty of mutual friendship and aid in
  1961. Today there are discussions in Beijing to revoke this treaty. China did not
  side with the north in the Korean War because of the Communist love affair. Chairman
  Mao Zedong considered mountainous Korea as useful ground to fight back the American
  troops and the United Nations  forces on the land than Taiwan divided by sea ruled
  by hostile General Chiang Kai-shek. The end of the Mao era, also ended China-North
  Korea Communist affair. Together, China and Japan can reform North Korea. The United
  States should stay at bay and just watch how things progress on that front China
  s adaptation to economic reforms and opening up of its free-market base economy
  in 1978, was viewed unenthusiastically by North Korea as somewhat harmful and marked
  an end to Socialism.  There was another  Cold War  between Peking and Moscow in
  the 1950s and continued during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.
  North Korea was more aligned with the Soviet Union than with China. At one time,
  Kim Il Sung also doubted his trust on China in unifying the Korean Peninsula. North
  Korea is isolated diplomatically but it was China that accorded it a place. There
  have been frequent high level diplomatic exchanges when Premier Kim Il Sung visited
  China in 1953. Kim Jong Ill visited China eleven times until 1991. His successor
  Kim Jong Il visited twice in 2000 and 2004 respectively. The last high-level exchange
  was made in May 2011 when Kim Jong Il met with Premier Wen Jiabao in Beijing. He
  also visited China in May and August 2010 and July 2006. In October 2005, 2009 and
  2010, Premier Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of
  his uncle Jang Song Thaek, the country s chief interlocutor with China and a relatively
  reform-minded official. The relations are never smooth between the two countries
  since then. China adopts a harder stance and raises its voice with other major powers
  and at the United Nations condemning North Korean provocations. Pyongyang does not
  receive much needed diplomatic and economic support from Beijing any longer. Avoiding
  a fall out on China in case of a military eventuality against North Korea, China
  repeatedly calls for calm, restraint, and a negotiated settlement on the Korean
  Peninsula. From Mao to Xi relations with the DPRK have considerably changed. However,
  unlike both of his predecessors, Kim Jong Un never undertook any visit to China
  after becoming the Supreme Leader of the DPRK. Ever since China distanced itself
  with the DPRK to a large extent. This was major shift in DPRK s relations with China.
  He missed out a chance to visit Beijing in 2015. Kim Jong Un was invited by China
  to participate at the 70th anniversary of the end of World War but he refused to
  make his first out-of-country visit as head of state because President Xi Jinping
  regretted to sit next to him on the reviewing stand at the parade. The relationship
  is not as close as lips and teeth any more. Kim Jong Un also disregards meeting
  important Chinese officials who are sent to Pyongyang for mutual consultations.
  A major irritant after the assassination of Jang Song Thaek, was the mysterious
  murder of Kim Jong Un s half-brother, Kim Jon Nam, at the Kuala Lumpur airport in
  February this year. These events changed the complexion of ties between Beijing
  and Pyongyang. What are the possibilities if the traditional relationship changes
  between China and North Korea? China is a free-market economy. It has an emerging
  global role to play in world s politics. The coming Sino-Japanese normalisation
  could also influence North Korea and it may look for help in trade and investment.
  Together, China and Japan could reform North Korea. The United States should stay
  at bay and just watch how things would move around North Korea.   The writer is

  potential encounter with dharna politics. That it does not come from the main opposition
  but, rather, from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) means that many will see
  this as a case of deserved retribution. For Khadim Rizvi and his cohorts have unveiled
  plans to hold the federal capital hostage once more. And this time around promises
  to be not so different from the last. Back then, of course, when the group effectively
  accused the then PMLN government of blasphemy over a clerical error   Khan, instead
  of calling for calm, chose to insist that the in-house inquiry into the matter be
  made public. And today, he stands on the receiving end. For the TLP has announced
  a long march from Lahore to Islamabad scheduled for this week. Admittedly, the state
  itself is not in the religo-political party s direct line of fire. But, in reality,
  this amounts to little more than mere semantics given that the latter is doing its
  best to push the new set-up into a corner over blasphemy. Indeed, the TLP has said
  that it will stay put unless and until the government cuts all diplomatic ties with
  the Netherlands over a proposed blasphemous cartoon competition organised by leader
  of the opposition, Geert Wilders. To be clear, there is no need for a sit-in at
  this stage. Not when the Senate has adopted a resolution protesting the move and
  has agreed to take the matter to the UNSC. Not when the Foreign Office had already
  registered an official complaint with the Dutch authorities. Not when the controversy
  is all set to be brought up at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council
  of Foreign Ministers powwow next month. All of which begs the question as to what
  the TLP has to gain from the anticipated dharna at this time? The short answer is
  that Rizvi is keen to build on the relative success that this party enjoyed in its
  first-ever general election; which saw it field more candidates than the PPP in
  the Punjab. And while the TLP failed to secure any National Assembly seats it did
  win two in Sindh. Moreover, the party took home more than two million votes in both
  the Lower House and in the provinces. Which of course represents a not unreasonable
  show of strength for a group that came into political being as recently as 2015.
  And as Rizvi has already said: the TLP is in it for the long haul. The litmus test
  for Khan therefore rests in how he handles the situation. Much of which will depend
  on the support he can muster from the joint opposition. It is extremely important
  that the mistakes of last November are not repeated; whereby notions of standing
  with an elected government gave way to opportunism across the board. That vacuum
  was filled by the Army who acted as a broker of peace between the agitators and
  the state. Again, the pressure is on to avoid a similar scenario. It is sincerely
  hoped that vendetta politics does not win so early in the day.  * Published in Daily

text: ' Back in my university life, feminism, as a discourse, used to fascinate me
  a lot as a student of Political Science. The reason for the fascination was twofold:
  One reason was objective in nature and the other was subjective. Knowing the fact
  the way the world had been objectively striving to make the states  economic development
  models gender inclusive in nature through Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with
  respect to which Pakistan had very poor indicators, I wanted to understand what
  were the factors that were impeding Pakistan s progress towards those objectively
  defined goals. On the subjective front, it invoked my interest because its discourse
  was challenging. It challenged my overall way of looking at the world, keeping in
  view I belonged to one of the religiously conservative districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
  Studying its discourse was nothing less than learning, unlearning and relearning
  my approach to understand social dynamics of the society I was part of; that is
  why I even pursued my final thesis about women empowerment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
  After having studied theoretical discourses related to feminism, having discussed
  its various nuances with a diverse spectrum of students from different backgrounds
  in Pakistan and having observed Pakistan s slow pace to catch up with feminist ideals
  being followed at large across the world, I have come to the conclusion that though
  the government has been taking steps to meet the criteria defined for women empowerment
  through comparisons with SDGs by taking steps in legal, economic and political spheres,
  yet it has hardly been making any substantial efforts in making its discourse heard
  among masses; as a result, every time the government tries to portray an outlook
  of pluralist Pakistan to the world, through laws aimed at women empowerment in any
  sphere of life, it has to face a formidable backlash from the masses. This is what
  happened recently with many legislations passed at Punjab Assembly for women empowerment.
  Almost everyone in the academia promotes the idea of women empowerment, but I have
  rarely come across someone who seems seriously concerned about the issue and wants
  to debate its nuances in a critical manner Although a plethora of human rights organisations
  are working for women empowerment in Pakistan- through following the mantra of personal-is-political
  and highlighting case stories of women  woes in order to not only subjectively aware
  the masses so that they understand the severity of the issue but also to push the
  government to take steps for women empowerment through pressure of the global media
  s attention   are working hard to make the discourse related to women empowerment
  perceptible among masses yet it is the sheer responsibility of the government to
  make sure it utilises every platform, especially academia, to educate masses about
  various nuances of women empowerment in which the government seems to have utterly
  failed. The best platform the government can optimise to spread its message of women
  empowerment to wider masses is academia. In academia, the government can sponsor
  research projects related to gender-related issues in the society and can arrange
  conferences over its various facets.  This will help students engage in meaningful
  ways and will help mold their minds about the issue in general. Students equipped
  with nuanced gender discourses will be messengers in their own society. However,
  honestly speaking, as per my observation, making government a punching bag for not
  customising academia for the promotion of pluralist society with reference to gender
  in Pakistan will be a sheer injustice to academia itself. Almost everyone in academia
  promotes the idea of women empowerment, but I have rarely come across someone, very
  few I would say, who are seriously concerned about this issue and want to have debates
  over its nuances in a critical manner. Deep below their superficial disposition
  towards women empowerment is embedded pervasive conservatism that has enveloped
  the society. Pakistan s pursuit of pluralist society through women empowerment in
  actual terms is not possible by taking objective measures in the likes of laws in
  order to meet the criteria of SDGs. Instead, it needs to engage its citizens subjectively
  on this issue. And the only way to do so is to educate the masses about the significance
  of the issue through critical discussions. Incredible things can happen if we start
  talking about this issue to one another. Since my graduation s thesis, I have come
  across students from a vast spectrum. Majority of them were from very conservative
  backgrounds like me. I was amazed to hear in conversations with them that they also
  found discourses related to women empowerment thought-provoking. The point in sharing
  my conversations with students from far-flung areas is that there is curiosity among
  students for counter-narratives. If they are provided with a counter-narrative apart
  from popular social narrative which society feeds them about role of women day,
  they can turn popular paradigms upside down through power of their imagination and
  can turn out to be harbingers for a gender inclusive society in Pakistan in the
  near future. Otherwise, their imaginative power will be used by the society for
  reinforcing its own conservative paradigms. There is a dire need that an inclusive
  effort is made to bring gender-related issues into public sphere so that its discussion
  is not perceived as a taboo anymore. Its discussion is made as normal and as significant
  as any political issue by masses which it does with a lot of interest. Exposing
  its masses to critical debates about women empowerment can help Pakistan achieve
  a pluralist society instead of chasing solely objective measures defined by the
  world which are out of touch with the challenges in Pakistan for gender mainstreaming.   The

  in two years, which left two people dead and 11 wounded in Jacksonville, before
  the gunman killed himself at a video game tournament. Witnesses told local media
  that the gunman, identified by police as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore, was a disgruntled
  gamer, angry because he lost Sunday s tournament. It was not clear if he knew his
  victims. While police have not identified the victims, family members told Jacksonville

  11 other people were wounded by gunfire and at least two others were injured while

  according to the venue s website. The winners of the contest go forward to the video
  game finals in Las Vegas and compete for $165,000. The latest rampage occurred amid
  a debate over US gun laws that was given fresh impetus by the massacre in February
  of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Two years ago a gunman killed
  49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. President Donald Trump has been briefed
  and is monitoring the situation in Jacksonville, the White House said. Game livestreamed
  The bar was livestreaming a football video game competition when the gunfire started,
  according to video shared on social media. In the video, players can be seen reacting
  to the shots and cries can be heard before the footage cuts off. Taylor Poindexter
  and her boyfriend, Marquis Williams, had traveled from Chicago to attend the tournament,
  and they fled when the gunfire erupted. She said she saw Katz take aim at his victims.  We
  did see him, two hands on the gun, walking back, just popping rounds,  Poindexter
  told reporters.  I was scared for my life and my boyfriend s.  Another gamer, Chris  Dubby  McFarland,
  was hospitalized after a bullet grazed his head.  I feel fine, just a scratch on
  my head. Traumatized and devastated,  he wrote on Twitter. The sheriff s office
  said many people were transported to hospital, and its deputies found many others
  hiding in locked areas at The Landing. A spokesman for Jacksonville s Memorial Hospital
  said it was treating three victims, all of whom were in stable condition. The conditions
  of other patients was not available early Monday. Reacting to news of the shooting
  during the tournament involving its game, Madden 19 maker Electronic Arts Inc said
  it was working with authorities to gather facts.  The tragic situation that occurred
  Sunday in Jacksonville was a senseless act of violence that we strongly condemn,  a
  company spokesperson said to Reuters late on Sunday.  Our most heartfelt sympathies
  go out to the families of the victims whose lives were taken today and those who
  were injured.  Published in Daily Times, August 28th 2018.        '

text: 'It has been one year. Since the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown
  on the Rohingya. The ensuing brutality in Rakhine State prompted an exodus of some
  700,00 of this mostly Muslim minority group into neighbouring Bangladesh. Shockingly,
  children account for 55 percent of the total refugee population. Fast-forward to
  the present and the UN has completed a one-and-a-half year-long fact-finding mission
  into the violence. It is one that paints a damning picture of the ruling regime.
  All the more so give that Naypyidaw denied the mission direct access to the country
  while also refusing any cooperation at all levels. Meaning that the latter was forced
  to rely on extensive interviews (875) and documents compiled in numerous field missions
  to Bangladesh as well as other neighbouring countries. Be that as it may, in its
  18-page report, released this week, the world body has recommended that the top
  military leadership be tried for genocide in Rakhine State and crimes against humanity
  in other areas. Either at the International Criminal Court (ICC) or at an ad-hoc
  criminal tribunal; similar to those established in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
  It also holds Aung Sang Suu Kyi and her civilian government responsible for not
  stemming the violence. So, what comes next? Hauling Myanmar to the ICC, however,
  will be problematic. The country is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established
  the Court. This would pass the burden of responsibility to the UNSC to ensure that
  justice is done. But even here, this path will likely not be a smooth one. For bluntly
  put, the major players   those with the power of veto   too, have their vested interests.
  Myanmar is crucial to Beijing s One Road, One Belt (OROB) initiative; promising
  as it does to  link  the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) to the Silk Road Economic Belt.
  There have been Chinese promises to exploit the natural resources of the Buddhist
  majority state. In addition, the near-end of the West s love affair with Suu Kyi,
  just three years after it supported her sweep to power in general elections, serves
  a resurgent Moscow. Both China and Russia have been engaged in training the Myanmar
  military. With the latter also playing the role of arms supplier. That being said,
  the West cannot claim moral authority when it comes to the bigger picture. After
  all, the Rohingya have endured state-sponsored persecution for decades. Such as
  the right to citizenship, which has been withheld since as far back as 1982. Yet
  the West s support for human rights over the years has focused almost exclusively
  on Suu Kyi and her years of house arrest that spanned a total of a decade and a
  half; with scant regard for systematic abuses of the most vulnerable. Thus if countries
  like the US and UK force a showdown over the prosecution question   they will invite
  calls of politically motivated manoeuvring and selective justice. Particularly at
  a time when the West has still to be held to account for military adventurism in
  the Muslim world. It is therefore hoped that the permanent five put aside self-serving
  regional interests before the UN mission presents its full report to the Human Rights
  Council next month. For time is running out.  *  Published in Daily Times, August

text: ' Forget about Ides of March, month of October too has been ominously significant
  for Pakistan. On October 16, 1951 a hired assassin s bullet to subvert democracy
  was fatally pierced into the heart of Pakistan s first Prime Minister Liaquat Ali
  Khan   most trusted lieutenant of the founder Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
  Earlier, he had survived an abortive quasi-military coup led by an army general.
  Ever since then democracy has never had a smooth ride. As per the historic data
  plus circumstantial evidence available, Liaquat was the first victim of cold war
  politics. It was either organized or carried out at the behest of a super power
  since he was adamant not to be part of its sinister scheme of things. He had refused
  to help Americans with Pakistani troops in the Korean War and declined to be part
  of Anglo-American conspiracy to oust popular Iranian Prime Minister Dr Mossadegh
  when he nationalised Anglo-Iranian Oil Company fleecing Iran of its oil wealth.
  Significantly, this year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth (October 17, 1817)
  of the greatest Indian Muslim reformer of the 19th Century   Sir Syed Ahmad Khan.
  Rightly called father of Muslim Renaissance in post 1857 India, only a man of his
  stature, vision, perseverance and determination could pull the Muslims out from
  the mire of decadence and re-launch them as a nation of substance. He picked them
  from the status of  hewers of wood and drawers of water  and ignited in them the
  spirit to seek education, respect, equitable opportunity and fight for their rights.
  He was the first to differentiate between Muslims and Hindus as two separate nations   two
  beautiful eyes of one body. Days of political importance and of seminal consequences
  are quite a few. Pakistan s first martial law was imposed on October 7, 1958 by
  President General Iskander Mirza. He abrogated the 1956 Constitution, dismissed
  Prime Minister Feroze Khan Noon just a few months before he was to announce first
  ever general elections. This illicit sharing of power arrangement could not last
  long and General Ayub showed his true colours by packing up Mirza on October 27,
  1958. So did we see the birth of Doctrine of Necessity for justifying subversion
  of democracy, constitution and rule of law   courtesy Chief Justice of Pakistan,
  Mr Justice Muhammad Munir   to sanctify might of the generals to play roughshod
  with the country s future. Mian Sahib has drawn battle lines. He considers himself
  a master in the art of confrontation. His daughter, too, is following in his footsteps.
  And unlike Punjab s political tradition, his party has stuck together and is rallying
  behind him  It also saw the emergence of a power troika comprising of generals,
  civil bureaucrats and superior judges   that, backed by Punjab s feudal elite created
  by the Raj and theocratic warlords who had opposed Pakistan   got into recognizable
  shape to replace MAJ s idea of a secular social welfare state with that of a garrison
  state. Presidential form of government was introduced and seeds of Pakistan s break
  up sowed, Gen Zia s coup and judicial murder by him of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan
  s first populist Prime Minister   were all sounds of death knell. One cannot encapsulate
  here all that happened in 70 years, one gets over to yet another coup on October
  12, 1999. An overly ambitious Prime Minister seeking to be Ameerul Momineen on the
  footsteps of Mulla Omar of Afghanistan, decided to get rid of his Army chief General
  Pervez Musharraf and then got knocked down by GPM s boomerang. Had his foreign mentors
  namely Saudis and American President Clinton   not intervened to save his neck,
  he would been a foot note in history.  Mian Sahib has drawn battle lines. He considers
  himself past master in the art of confrontation. His daughter too is following his
  footsteps. And surprisingly   unlike Punjab s political traditions   his party is
  still sticking together. Even people like Ch Nisar who pose as the most holy among
  the holiest, do whimper quite often and host an attitude of hostility but refuse
  to bite. Obviously MNS  message of defiance are rightly being considered as offensive
  and due attention is being given by the Establishment. Clash of institutions continues
  to threaten the federation. While the First institution is being obliquely challenged,
  highest judiciary seems to be a clear target as the villain of the piece for unseating
  for him the pleasure of powers that be. MNS and his family members disqualified
  by the Supreme Court, initially seemed reluctant to appear before the Accountability
  Court- is it change of heart, saner advice or adoption of new strategy? One would
  tend to see more of strategy in it in keeping with his overall policy of defiance.
  First hearing of Mian Sahib s appearance in the Accountability Court seemed to be
  a piece of rewind of 1997 when PLM-N goons thoroughly desecrated the Supreme Court
  and forced its Chief Justice to resign. Mian Sahib is both born again democrat and
  an ideologue as he calls himself. His stand is also sound that how long would the
  nation be helpless witness to see elected prime ministers sent home by the establishment.
  However, his claim that he has been disqualified for his revolutionary development
  programme to usher in over all good for the people and that there has been no corruption
  in his government   can only make one laugh at this psycho pathetic state of mind.
  His first dismissal was on charges of corruption, second for more corruption, over
  ambitious aggrandizement of power and attempt to completely obliterate opposition
  and voice of dissent. His overwhelming majority in National Assembly almost got
  him to be Ameerul Momineen but for the PPP dominated Senate that did not let it
  happen. It was his excessive abuse of power, vendetta against opposition leaders
  and illegal massive accumulation of wealth through mega corruption coupled with
  his own Bonapartist ambitions made General Pervez Musharraf take over. Popularly
  it was considered a blessing in disguise   welcomed by people who had been fed up
  by his style of governance. While people distributed sweets, his party beneficiaries
  found safety in their holes. Situation at that, one apprehends that the policy of
  confrontation   though politically romantic it sounds   may not end in repeating
  history.   The writer is former High Commissioner of Pakistan to UK and a veteran
  journalist     Published in Daily Times, October 11th 2017.       12Shares '

text: ' In response to article, Fudging & fraudulence published in Daily Times on
  October 1, 2017], a clarification, issued by Ministry of Finance, which was published
  on October 8, 2017. In the article historical data with evidence was presented to
  show how Shaukat Aziz and Daniyal Aziz accused the sitting Finance Minister of figure
  fudging. He till today has not filed any case of defamation against them. Daniyal
  Aziz is now part of Cabinet of which Dar is also a member! In the article alleged
  fudging of figures and fiscal data during the era of Musharraf-Shaukat and Pakistan
  People Party (2008-2013) was also highlighted. It was not Ishaq Dar specific or
  targeted article. It was to show how our successive governments were manipulating
  data to show rosy picture at fiscal front. The spokesperson of Ministry of Finance
  even did not bother to look at the references and links of stories quoted in the
  article that alleged withholding of refunds personally at the orders of Finance
  Minister and how he twisted the arm of Federal Tax Ombudsman and Chairman Federal
  Board of Revenue (FBR) to disown the report posted on website. In the article, Muhammad
  Zubair, Governor of Sindh was quoted allegedly accusing Ishaq Dar of cheating ousted
  Prime Minister-the clarification is totally silent about it. Governor specifically
  said that  businessmen are facing hardships due to long pending tax refunds . If
  there is no issue of refunds as portrayed in the clarification, Governor Zubair
  should be asked to withdraw or clarify his statement. Spokesperson should ask the
  Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) to issue a Press
  note that businessmen have no issue of pending refunds with FBR. In the clarification,
  the spokesperson took much pain to prove that FBR has issued more refunds than earlier
  years. This is not the issue. The issue is why all the outstanding refunds are not
  paid. Law does not allow withholding of refunds. Refunds should be issued as per
  time limit provided in statutes and not according to schedule of payment decided
  by Finance Minister of anybody else. He is not above law of the land. Who has given
  authority to Finance Minister or Chairman FBR to announce the schedule of payment
  of refunds, mentioned in the clarification as under?  It was announced that refund
  payment orders issued up to April 30, 2017, shall be paid in two stages, i.e. by
  July15, 2017 and August14, 2017, in respect of RPOs up to Rs. 1 million and above
  Rs 1 million, respectively. Total refund amounting to Rs 26,338 million on account
  of sales tax has been paid in the current financial year against 10,579 cases of
  exporters as well as non-exporters. Overall in the CFY 2017-18, a refund of Rs 41
  billion has been paid against Rs 18 billion in PFY 2016-17 recording a substantial
  growth of around 120 percent . The reality is that Ishaq Dar admitted before National
  Assembly s Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics
  and Privatisation on November 26, 2015 that quantum of refunds payable was over
  Rs. 200 billion. Spokesperson before issuance of clarification should have seen
  the record of Parliament. It was own confession of Ishaq Dar and this time not under
  duress!! In the past, the Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and Chairmen FBR have been
  lying before the Standing Committees of Senate and National Assembly about quantum
  of refunds due. On May 13, 2014, the then chairman FBR claimed that  only Rs97 billion
  were payable as refunds . On November 26, 2015, Ishaq Dar and new chairman admitted
  that the actual figure was Rs. 200 billion. The last claim in the clarification

  and reported in the budget documents  is contrary to the facts as per following
  story [ Government shows Rs.212b statistical error to cut budget deficit , The Express
  Tribune, September 8, 2016]:  In an apparent attempt to conceal the worsening fiscal
  position, the government has declared a spending of Rs212 billion as a statistical
  discrepancy aimed at nullifying the impact of lower-than-targeted revenue collection
  and excessive current expenditures. According to a summary of fiscal operations
  for financial year 2015-16 that the Ministry of Finance released on Wednesday, there
  was a statistical discrepancy of Rs212.1 billion in budgetary books. Statistical
  discrepancy means revenues and expenditures whose source and purposes are not known
  for the time being. Receipts from the United States and the State Bank of Pakistan
  (SBP) fell short of targets whereas the government cut its development budget by
  Rs107 billion to make up for the revenue shortfall. There is a clear indication
  that the government has deliberately declared the statistical discrepancy. In table
  one of fiscal operations, total expenditures of federal and provincial governments
  were Rs5.8 trillion. But in table three, the expenses were above Rs6 trillion in
  2015-16 that ended on June 30. It is for the second time that the discrepancy has
  swelled to that extent. Earlier, in 2013-14, it stood at Rs215 billion after $1.5
  billion, declared as a gift from Saudi Arabia, was placed under this head. During
  its first three years in power, the PML-N government has booked Rs605 billion as
  statistical discrepancy, five times more than the statistical errors of Rs117 billion
  shown in last three years of the PPP government. Can spokesperson of Ministry of
  Finance tell the nation about above facts and figures? If the report was false what
  action did the Ministry took against it? The article, fudging & fraudulence, was
  based on published reports and documents. In the clarification, no rebuttal is made
  in respect of these reports and documents. The spokesperson may better take up the
  matter with Governor Muhammad Zubair who openly accused Ishaq Dar of not only keeping
  Nawaz Sharif in dark about refunds but also painting before him wrong picture of
  economy. The issue of non-payment of refunds and taking advances for showing higher
  revenue collection should be probed by Public Accounts Committee with the help of
  an audit firm of international repute. It is high time that this process should
  start immediately. The spokespersons of Ministry of Finance and FBR should come
  forward and offer their accounts for audit. It will be in their own interest to
  prove what they have claimed in clarification issued to this newspaper.   The writer,

text: 'An asylum-seeker boat has reached Australia for the first time in almost four
  years, the government said Monday, with many of those on board the Vietnamese vessel
  fleeing into mangrove rainforest after it ran aground in crocodile-infested waters.
  Locals said passengers from the rickety vessel disappeared into the dense forest
  near the Daintree River, north of popular tourist city Cairns, in the tropical far
  north of Queensland state on Sunday. They will have to avoid crocodiles, venomous
  snakes and giant cassowaries   one of the world s deadliest and aggressive birds   that
  all call the ancient Daintree rainforest home. Queensland Police Minister Mark Ryan
  told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 15 passengers had been found so far.
  The ABC added that two others, including the boat s captain, were still missing.
  The Brisbane Courier Mail reported that up to 20 were unaccounted for. It said those
  detained were well dressed and in good health. State Emergency Service area controller
  Peter Rinaudo said earlier his crews were searching through the mangroves and near
  the mouth of the river, reportedly with dogs.  It ll be a hard slog, it s still
  quite warm in there and it ll be tough conditions for the guys,  he told the ABC.  I
  hope the people, however many there are, get located   it s not a nice area for
  them to be in.   Home affairs minister Peter Dutton said the partially sunk vessel
  had come from Vietnam and was the first boat of asylum-seekers to reach the country
  since 2014.  Australia, we believe, has received the first  people-smuggling venture
  in over 1,400 days,  he told reporters.  We will work with the agencies to make
  sure we can repatriate these people back to their country of origin, once we understand
  the facts of the matter.  Dutton did not confirm how many passengers were on board
  or their nationalities. Illegal fishing Under Canberra s tough immigration policy,
  asylum-seekers who try to reach Australia by boat are either turned back or sent
  to remote Pacific camps where conditions have been widely criticised. They are blocked
  from resettling in Australia. The United Nations and human rights advocates say
  the policy violates the 1951 Refugee Convention of which Australia is a signatory.
  Dutton reaffirmed the government s stance on Monday, saying the boat s arrival was  a
  reminder that people-smugglers have not gone out of business .  We ve had a very
  proud record, over the course of the last few years, and we aren t going to take
  a backward step. The people-smugglers  will not succeed in putting people on to
  boats to get to Australia.  Most asylum-seeker boats that have arrived in Australia
  in recent years embarked from Indonesia, though some originated in Sri Lanka. Former
  Border Force chief Roman Quaedvlieg tweeted Monday that Vietnamese fishing boats  have
  been illegally fishing in fleets  off the far north Queensland coast in the past
  two years due to their own depleted fishing stocks.  Possible the Daintree vessel
  & crew have used this activity as a staging point to make Oz landfall & avoid returning
  to VN (Vietnam),  he added. Published in Daily Times, August 28th 2018.        '

text: ' According to research, man-made political and economic institutions determine
  economic success (or the lack of it). It is important to forge a society that creates
  incentives, rewards innovation, and allows everyone to participate in economic opportunities.
  The economic success thus made possible is sustained because the government becomes
  accountable and responsive to the citizens it governs. What makes a difference is
  the politics that create completely different interrelated sets of norms as well
  as institutions that help make the society dynamic and effective in terms of inputs
  and desired outputs. Historical evidence and case studies give ideas of positive
  and negative factors of growth and development. To address current questions relating
  to poverty, disease, illiteracy, and standard of living of the people as well as
  internal and external threats to the state, we need to build a new theory of political
  economy. Interplay between political and economic institutions is important to understand
  for a way forward. Of utmost importance is the need for maintaining harmony and
  balance within and among the institutions. Specifically checks and balances in the
  triangular relationship between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.
  An effective system of authority, responsibility and accountability is essential
  for good governance and fair play. It is vital for the government to ensure that
  the writ of the state is firmly established and that all three wings of the government
  function in an environment of understanding, cooperation, and uniform national outlook.
  Jihadis were initially created and nourished by the US for its own goals and objectives.
  There is    no justification for them to use blame games after the tremendous sacrifices
  of men and material offered by Pakistan Unnecessary tensions damage the image of
  institutions which reduce their efficacy at achieving their required and desired
  goals and objectives. Politicians should refrain from making unnecessary statements
  and comments that become road-blocks to progress. Statements which negatively impact
  the process of innovation and support required for facilitating the socio-economic
  development. Reflection is necessary for everyone to correct themselves and help
  in nation building efforts. There is no room for  blame games  and uncalled for
  comments which express little but negativity. To put it straight there is a need
  for cordial Civil-Military relations at a stage where the state is facing existential
  threats, both internal and external.  The situation in Afghanistan has not improved
  after 16 years of the War on Terror for which the Bush administration had often
  utilised coercive tactics and threats to make Pakistan part of the coalition force
  under the leadership of the United States and NATO. Despite of the fact which is
  known to all, that peace in Pakistan depends on peace in Afghanistan, the Trump
  administration seems to be employing the same game the Bush administration used
  to pressurise Pakistan. Arm-twisting will not help. It is time for the United States
  (US) to do more. US Defence Secretary Mattis  stance on Xi Jinping s One Belt, One
  Road initiative has many contradictions. The US had supported the project at a forum
  in Beijing earlier this year Jihadis were initially created and nourished by the
  US for its own goals and objectives. There is no justification for them to use blame
  games after the tremendous sacrifices of men and material offered by Pakistan to
  root out terrorism and terrorists of any specification. Pakistan is always open
  to talks and to reason but will not accept any undue strategy and action, especially,
  when Pakistan s arch-rival is a friend of the United States. When business-as-usual
  starts to threaten the state and it s legitimacy, out of box solutions are required.
  We need visionaries who can come up with long term solutions. Inspirational and
  motivational statements are necessary. But the reality of internal and external
  threats cannot be denied. We simply cannot afford to live with the sources of these
  threats. We need to keep our eyes open. Analyse facts, separate them from fiction.
  Politics is an instrument to be used with care.  There are indications which can
  help understand current situations to better predict tomorrow. According to the
  Pakistani Foreign Office, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will benefit
  the Af-Pak region and beyond. The US has been asked to focus on human rights violations
  in Kashmir. US Defence Secretary Mattis  stance on Xi Jinping s One Belt One Road
  (OBOR) initiative has many contradictions. The US itself had supported the project
  at a forum in Beijing this year. Moreover, the Trump administration is enhancing
  trade ties with China. The question is how could the United States ignore Indian
  efforts to create instability in Pakistan? Apparently the current policy employed
  by the US is directly or indirectly supporting the Indian agenda. As a country often
  referred to as  the leader of the free world  the United States has the responsibility
  to stand upright and speak the truth. Peace is possible through joint efforts. It
  takes two to tango. I request President Trump to reintroduce passion into fashion;
  to bring back humanity and positive human values into action. It will be a great
  contribution if Trump delivers on his promise to help reduce tensions between India
  and Pakistan. That is the only road to peace in this region.   The writer is a former

text: ' Is Trump going to survive the media and judicial assault regarding the Travel
  Ban and the US-Mexico Border Wall? Will Modi succeed in transforming secular India
  into an India overshadowed by Hindutva? And how will Brexit will affect European
  politics and the fate of the European Union? Although, these questions sound a bit
  far-fetched, their relevance cannot be denied. The history of the world is witness
  that almost every century contains certain elements of society in a nation rising
  against the prevailing status quo. In the US, Trump s  Make America Great Again  and
  subsequent rise to power was a result of his rightist-nationalistic thoughts and
  fervour. His promises to build the wall, ban on certain Muslim countries and to
  bring jobs and industry back to the American people paved the public opinion in
  his favour. Again, Modi s consolidation of power in India though perceived as a
  surprise by many was the right-wing extremist Hindutva ideology of the Rashtriya
  Swayamsavek Sangh (RSS) and the Sangh Parivar with almost 90 years of conspiracies
  and mischievous plans, which finally paid off. The roughly 53 affiliated organisations
  of RSS have virtually taken over all of India. The book Bharatiya Janata Party and
  the Indian Muslims (2014) by Dr Muhammad Mujeeb Afzal describes that BJP as the
  political wing of the RSS. In Angela Merkel s Germany, the historical injustices
  done to the German nation whether it was the Treaty of Versailles, Lend-Lease Agreement,
  or the occupation and subsequent division of Germany into East and West Germany;
  have cast an indelible mark on the strategic thinking of the German nation. The
  policies of Angela Merkel are not only centred on Germany but the role played by
  German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier (now German President) in the Iranian
  Nuclear Deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action-2015); where the P5+1 was in fact
  dominated by him. To assume that Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall and its
  re-unification in 1991 again rose to the status of a great power in just 20 years  time
  is not entirely incorrect. Seemingly, Brexit happened due to the domination of EU
  by Germany that was unacceptable for US and UK. It is a fact that world politics
  is taking a turn in favour of the right-wing and conservative political parties
  and leaders. Is it due to the inherited anarchic international structure or a backlash
  of politicising liberal values around the globe? The recent statement by Trump that
  Germany owes money to NATO and US is a clear sign that the great powers are again
  terrified by the tremendous progress made by the German nation in almost every walk
  of life. With Francois Fillon or Marine Le Pen or Benoit Hamon as President in Paris,
  it is certain that France will also leave the EU just like Britain. Marine and Hamon
  are more inclined towards the right in comparison with Fillon. France is in a constant
  state of security dilemma due to the growing power and influence of Germany, not
  only in the EU but also internationally. Whoever comes to power in France, it would
  lead the Fifth Republic to the path dominated by conservatism and protectionism.
  Similarly, the Fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 was translated by many as the emergence
  of a unipolar world. But with President Putin, Russia has gained the international
  attention and is determined to preserve the Assad Regime in Syria. This has led
  many to believe that the international system is increasingly becoming multi-polar.
  His concrete determination made Forbes magazine declare him as the most powerful
  man in the world. With Shinzo Abe as the Prime Minster of Japan, the tensions in
  the Pacific are high. His conservative ambitions are further fuelled by his repeated
  visits to Trump. The historic Sino-Japan rivalry is bringing Tokyo and Washington
  much closer and with the blessings of Trump, Abe is increasing its presence in the
  South China Sea. Trump s proposal during his election campaign to arm Japan with
  nuclear arsenal; if materialised would be the beginning of an ugly conflict in the
  Asia-Pacific.   Interestingly in Austria, right-wing Norbert Hofer was defeated
  by Alexander Van der Bellen in the 2016 Elections, but it is fascinating that he
  had 46 percent of the popular vote in his favour. In Turkey with Tayyip Erdogan
  s rightist policies, Ankara has regained its regional and international importance.
  His growing relations with Putin with solid criticism on the West and Israel have
  made him a perfect rightist-conservative. Likewise, Philippines remained a colony
  of democratic America for many decades but with Rodrigo Duterte as President, the
  people of Philippines have given their verdict while breaking the status-quo. It
  is a fact that world politics is taking a turn in favour of the right-wing and conservative
  political parties and leaders. Is it due to the inherited anarchic international
  structure or a backlash of politicising liberal values around the globe? Many analysts
  and political minds contemplate and perhaps are sceptical of the  Rise of the Right  on
  the international level. But provided the changing geopolitical and geostrategic
  environment, it would not be incorrect to conclude that the phenomenon is not only
  real but is rising at a remarkable speed. A dimension can be drawn from the above
  discussion and facts that the  New Cold War  might turn  Red Hot  real soon.   The

text: 'Translating his words to action on conserving public funds, Prime Minister
  (PM) Imran Khan s adoption of a temperate lifestyle with only two supporting staff
  is a clear signal for the political elite around him, as well as the civil bureaucracy.
  Hopefully, this move will bring about some positive change. Though it is clear that
  more than anything else, this is a symbolic gesture. Some meaningful decisions also
  emerged from the new government s first Cabinet meeting. PM Imran Khan and his team
  have shown vigour to take up austerity measures that they expect will save billions
  over the years if implemented in letter and spirit. Abolishing of the discretionary
  funds and taking up the projects to the parliament for their formal approval would
  certainly lead to constitutional supremacy over the whims and wishes of the individuals
  sitting in Parliament and the Cabinet. However, eliminating corruption will be the
  Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government s top priority. The decision to take up
  the forensic audit of the mass-transport projects in Multan, Islamabad, Peshawar
  and Lahore   including the Orange Line Metro Train Project   is highly appreciable
  for the sake of transparency and accountability. When similar projects in Khyber
  Pakhtunkhwa (KP) are omitted from the list, the whole endeavour becomes an exercise
  in political victimisation. Why is auditing mass transport projects more important
  than auditing all civil and military development projects initiated over the past
  ten years? Regardless, the new government s reassurances that it will retrieve money
  stolen from the country has given the nation hope yet again. However, economists
  believe that the expert selected by the new government   who has experience working
  with NAB   has no idea how these funds are to be retrieved under the bilateral or
  multilateral tax treaties signed by Pakistan. This is an observation the government
  should cross-check for the sake of its own credibility. The federal government could
  ask that the Rangers be deployed in the country s northern areas to combat indiscriminate
  deforestation. Illegal timbre must be confiscated. The toothless forest departments
  and district governments simply aren t up to this task The decision to ban the use
  of special aircrafts for foreign tours of top government and state dignitaries could
  save a significant amount for Pakistani taxpayers. Restricting everyone to the club-class
  for their international travel could prove instrumental in changing the social climate.
  The drive will become unbelievably significant and meaningful if the PM, his cabinet
  and parliamentarians travel in the economy-class. The Cabinet has also decided to
  make our cities clean and green through a country-wide urban tree plantation drive
  and new sanitation projects. Malik Amin Aslam, an Advisor on climate change and
  the environment, has yet to come up with details about the tree plantation initiative,
  but we know the government intends to plant 10 billion saplings over the next five
  years. Malik Amin Aslam is perhaps our only politician who is a well-respected environmentalist
  in Pakistan and abroad. He holds the position of global vice president with the
  International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). As such,
  expectations are very high. However, his critics have pointed out many flaws and
  lacunas in his  Billion Tree Green Tsunami , campaign which was said to be marred
  by corruption as well.  Strangely, every government, from the federal to district
  level, is interested in planting millions of saplings twice a year. Still, none
  of them have been able to offer a solution to the indiscriminate deforestation plaguing
  our country. Saving four million trees a year from the timber-mafia will be much
  more effective at combatting climate change than planting billions of new saplings.
  Furthermore, the timber-mafia could not function if it was not supported by the
  political elite and bureaucracy. Good initiatives cannot bring change until criminal
  practices are allowed to continue. The present federal government has been labelled
  the  establishment s baby . This could be an opportunity for the federal government
  to ask that rangers  be deployed in the country s northern areas to combat indiscriminate
  deforestation. Illegal timbre must be confiscated by the government. The toothless
  forest departments and district governments simply aren t up to this task. Only
  the rangers could help in recovering the hundreds of thousands of logs waiting to
  be transported downstream. Immediate action can stop the money from going into the
  pockets of the mafia. Additionally, selling the timber on higher bids in the open
  market could bring good money to the national exchequer. Regarding the sanitation
  projects, the Cabinet decided to form a taskforce to prepare plans for a countrywide
  cleanliness drive. Another taskforce is to review the issue of urban housing, with
  particular attention to matters related to slum settlements across the country.
  These are pertinent decisions indeed. The Cabinet has also vowed to complete all
  projects started under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This must have
  brought a sigh of relief to the Chinese government and Chinese companies. Regardless,
  the Pakistani government needs to safeguard commitments made with China and other
  countries while negotiating with the US delegation due to visit on September 5.
  Pakistan s interests must be given priority over demands from Washington. The writer

text: ' Smear campaign against Saleem Safi is unjustified Saleem Safi reported that
  Mian Nawaz Sharif had paid over Rs 6 million to the state exchequer for his personal
  expenses. This infuriated the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf s (PTI) supporters. They
  initiated a vicious campaign against him, calling him all kinds of names. He was
  described as a stooge of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), who has been
  receiving money from the Sharif family. However, Haroonur Rasheed defended him,
  though he didn t name him. He deplored that the PTI supporters had subjected the
  journalist to a campaign of vituperation. Those who know him will testify to the
  fact that he has never been anyone s stooge. He has never sang the praises of any
  ruler or leader. He has been a critic of Nawaz Sharif for the last four years, and
  earns enough money to not have to depend on PML-N handouts. In fact, he makes more
  money than the Army Chief and the Prime Minister (PM). However, he lives frugally.
  Regardless, those making these allegations did not hesitate for a second. It seems
  this society is going from bad to worse, but nobody is concerned. How the PTI chief
  got rid of Awn Chaudhry Saleem Safi wrote in an Urdu newspaper that Awn Chaudhry
  has been Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi s right-hand man and special confidant for many
  years. He used to be seen everywhere with Imran. I saw many PTI bigwigs kowtow to
  him. However, for some time we had been getting the impression that Imran wanted
  to get rid of him, but he was waiting for the appointment of his ADC. Awn was tasked
  with the drawing up of the guest list for the oath taking ceremony. Many PTI leaders
  were begging Awn to invitation cards until 2 AM. Surprisingly, at the ceremony he
  was conspicuous by his absence. Unexpectedly, instead of Awn Chaudhry, Zulfi Bukhari
  was seen with the First Lady. Upon meeting his military secretary, the new PM issued
  his first order:  Awn Chaudhry should not be seen anywhere near the Aiwan-i-Sadar
  or the PM s House.  Imran is the first person to become PM with people s power On
  August 18 a prominent TV news channel quoted PML-Q leader and former PM, as saying
  that Imran Khan is the first person who became PM with the people s power. He stated
  21 earlier PMs, including himself, were made by other powers. He went on to say
  that he himself  made  two PMs with his own hands. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry
  said that the recent clash with members of the Ahmedi community started over a cockfight
  and that it had no religious dimension Imran Khan worked hard for 22 years to achieve
  his mission. No earlier PM achieved this office through practical struggle. All
  of us should cooperate with him, so that he accomplishes his 22-year-old goal. It
  must be added that in 2002, Imran Khan had complained to the State Bank that Chaudhry
  Shujaat Hussain and Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi had gotten a loan of Rs 240 million written-off.  Ahmadi
  place of worship torched According to a report published in a prominent English
  newspaper on August 24, 31 people were injured and an Ahmadi place of worship was
  set on fire following a verbal spat between two groups of youngsters in Ghaseet
  Pura RB-69, a village near Faisalabad, on August 23. A youngster riding a motorcycle
  ran over a chicken belonging to an Ahmadi family, starting the conflict. Slogans
  were shouted, shots were fired, stones were pelted, and a nearby Ahmadi place of
  worship was damaged and set on fire   all in the presence of police officials. Jasarat,
  Jamaat-i-Islami s mouthpiece, reported on August 25 that as a result of an attack
  perpetrated by Ahmadis , one Muslim had been killed and 22 injured. Khalid Lateef
  Cheema, secretary general, Majlas-i-Ahrar, was quoted as saying that this incident
  was the result of promoting Qadianiyyat. While addressing a press conference, Information
  Minister Fawad Chaudhry said that the conflict started over a cockfight and that
  it had no religious dimension. Fazlur Rahman for breaking-off diplomatic relations
  with the Netherlands Maulana Fazlur Rahman, the chief of the JUI-F and the MMA,
  has said that by announcing the publication of blasphemous cartoons, the rulers
  of the Netherlands are playing with the sentiments of Muslim Ummah. This was published
  in a report in a notable Urdu newspaper. Fazlur Rehman called the competition  open
  terrorism  and demanded that Islamabad break-off diplomatic relations with the Netherlands.
  He went on to say the Islamic world should urge the UN to make laws to ensure that
  sacred personalities and religions are respected. Blasphemy against every prophet
  should be declared a crime and it should be punishable by death. He termed those
  organising this contest the biggest enemies of the Islamic world. Islamic countries
  should break their silence and take a brave stand in this regard. Islamabad, get
  ready for another Tehreek-i-Labbaik sit-in Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik
  Pakistan (TLP) Chief, has announced that his party will hold a long march from Lahore
  to Islamabad over the exhibition of blasphemous cartoons in the Netherlands. This
  was in a report published on August 27. The march will start on August 29 and will
  become a sit-in upon reaching Islamabad. The sit-in will continue until Pakistan
  does not break off all kinds of diplomatic relations with the Netherlands. Rizvi
  has demanded the expulsion of the Netherlands  ambassador and has urged the UN and
  other global institutions to give up their old traditions and play their role in
  get the publication of cartoons stopped. The writer has studied international relations
  in Islamabad and media in London. He has worked for several English-language newspapers.
  He has written a book, Handbook of Functional English, for the benefit of those
  who wish to improve their English skills. He can be reached at shakil.chaudhry@gmail.com

text: ' The National Defence University, where I also go occasionally to waste the
  time of the good folks there, holds an annual National Security Workshop (NSW),
  essentially for parliamentarians. I think this event numbers is close to topping
  my  most useful  list of things to do. This year s NSW is drawing to a close and,
  as part of the grand finale, participants are expected to share their views on some
  aspect of governance. This year it is the turn of the National Action Plan. I have
  the honour of mentoring one or two of the groups this time round. And they have
  chosen as their subject, Military Courts. Attending their discussions, I found myself
  constrained to offer advice. Thus I am writing this piece to share those views here,
  on this forum. To begin with, Military Courts are an anachronism and an aberration
  to the modern concept of justice. Having said that, with some reluctance, I must
  also admit that circumstances sometimes render even aberrations a necessity. Our
  current state, in which injustice rules, judges, investigators, prosecutors, and
  witnesses are all under threat, is perhaps one in which the aberration is a necessity.
  The groups under my mentorship agreed. Nevertheless, they did have some apprehensions.
  Foremost was whether capital punishment falls within the  doctrine of necessity
  ? If it does, how, then, are we to justify this to the international community?
  How can we avoid being ostracised as well as having our Generalised Scheme of Preferences
  (GSP plus) status revoked? The latter point is pertinent given that such a move
  would exacerbate our already precarious economic situation. Since I have no intention
  of debating the ethics or efficacy of capital punishments here, I move beyond. In
  legal parlance there is a term Amicus Curiae, which is Latin for  friend of the
  court . Usually a well reputed judge or lawyer sits not as a member of the court
  but in an advisory capacity, whereby his opining represents a matter of record.
  This could be the way forward for our military courts That we are at war is more
  or less an established fact. This is a war. The enemy is the most insidious one
  there can be,  The Enemy Within . Relentless and cruel to the extreme; we are at
  war. However, in wars, soldiers fight each other on the battlefield. And, those
  operating behind enemy lines are required to declare themselves. Only then do the
  Geneva Conventions apply. Pointing out current American practices as well as the
  socio-legal safeguards the US has emplaced by executing blatant injustice by way
  of military courts, but far from US soil, is a very poor example to quote. Moreover,
  Washington enjoys a unique status, even at the UN; which we don t. However, before
  the world body overtly began to do the US bidding, we have the example of UN-approved
  Military Trials after WW II, notably at Nuremberg.  While the precedent for  War
  Crimes  trials was set at Leipzig after WW I   it was at Nuremberg where concepts
  of War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity, and War of Aggression crystallised into
  international jurisprudence. Consequently, the first step to justify recourse to
  Military Courts and Capital Punishment is to establish that these courts are set
  up to deal with War Crimes. Definitions of War Crimes as set out in UN manuals are:  intentionally
  killing civilians or prisoners, torture, destroying civilian property, taking hostages,
  perfidy, rape, using child soldiers, pillaging, declaring that no quarter will be
  given, and serious violations of the principles of distinction and proportionality
  . Is there anything in this list that our terrorists have overlooked? I see nothing
  missing. They are committing all of the above and then some. Our defensive argument
  has to hinge on proving that:  a) we are at war; and b) that those engaging us in
  this war are guilty of War Crimes. If we can establish these two facts   we need
  not worry about the international community or, indeed, our GSP plus status. However,
  at Nuremberg, the four states which contributed to the trials all provided a judge
  to preside over each hearing. The Russians were the only ones who produced soldiers
  as judges; which posed some difficulties, even at Nuremberg. The film, Judgment
  at Nuremberg deals with precisely this subject. Most non-military personnel hold
  the view that no judicial representation exists within our military court system.
  Actually, this is not strictly true. It is mandatory for every military court to
  grant procedural access to a member of the military judiciary, the Judge Advocate
  General, JAG Branch, where all members must have a law degree. Yet this is not without
  problems. For while these learned folk may know the law   they may not be jurists
  and, consequently, may not comprehend  beyond reasonable doubt    a concept to which,
  I am not sure, should be strictly adhered. As at Nuremberg, one solution might be
  to have a high court judge as a member of each military court bench. Here again
  we are likely to face our psycho-social complexities pertaining to our old friend,
  the ego. In other words, a high court judge may find it below  His Lordship-ly  honour
  to sit on a military court. But, where there is a will, there is a way. In legal
  parlance there is a term Amicus Curiae, which is Latin for  friend of the court
  . Usually a well reputed judge or lawyer who sits not as a member of the court but
  in an advisory capacity, whereby his opining represents a matter of record. Our
  military courts could, while retaining the compulsory member of the court from the
  JAG Branch, have a reputable lawyer as per Amicus Curiae. Any Pakistani advocate
  willing to take on this  challenge  will only have his reputation enhanced. While
  our military courts will enjoy genuine civilian judicial presence and, one hopes,
  also a jurist present.   The writer is a retired brigadier. He is also former vice

text: 'Pope Francis has declined to comment on a claim he personally ignored sexual
  abuse allegations against a senior clergyman, after a visit to Ireland dominated
  by Church scandals. Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, a former Vatican envoy to the
  United States, said he had told Francis of the allegations against prominent US
  cardinal Theodore McCarrick in 2013. But rather than punish McCarrick, who was forced
  to resign last month, Vigano said Francis had lifted sanctions imposed on him by
  his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI. Vigano called on Francis to resign in a letter
  published Saturday in the National Catholic Register. He said the pope  knew from
  at least June 23, 2013, that McCarrick was a serial predator,  adding that  he knew
  that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end . But the pope refused
  to address the brewing scandal on Sunday.  I will not say a word about that. I think
  that the communique speaks for itself,  Francis said on his plane as he flew back
  from Dublin to Rome. He had  begged for God s forgiveness  for past clerical abuse
  scandals during his landmark trip to Ireland, where they have badly damaged the
  image of the Catholic Church.  He said he was demanding  firm and decisive  measures
  to find  truth and justice . Nope to the pope Before 45,000 supporters at the rain-soaked
  Knock shrine in the west of Ireland on Sunday, the pope spoke of the  open wound  of
  the scandals. He later said mass to tens of thousands of flag-waving worshippers
  before heading back to Rome after his two-day visit. He also acknowledged other
  abuses by the Irish church, including at its so-called  mother and baby  homes for
  unwed mothers. In the Irish capital, about 5,000 abuse victims and supporters braved
  the weather to attend a  Stand for Truth  rally. A woman dressed as a nun, with
  fake blood on her hands, and a man handing out homemade placards reading  The church
  protects pederasts  were among those protesting. It was the first papal trip to
  Ireland since John Paul II spoke in front of 1.5 million people during a visit in
  1979.  I think it s obviously causing quite a lot of distress,  abuse victim and
  campaigner William Gorry said of the visit.  Healing is something that s going to
  take a long, long time if it s going to happen at all,  he told AFP. At another  Nope
  to the Pope  demonstration, protesters called for gay and transgender recognition,
  a clearer separation of religion and state in Ireland and the acceptance of contraception
  by the Vatican   as well as action on abuse. The pope went to Ireland to close the
  2018 World Meeting of Families   a global Catholic gathering that addressed issues
  including the treatment of gay people in the Church. On the plane back to Rome,
  the pope recommended parents seek psychiatric help for children who show homosexual
  tendencies.  When it shows itself from childhood, there is a lot that can be done
  through psychiatry, to see how things are. It is something else if it shows itself
  after 20 years,  he said.  Stain  on the Church Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar
  on Saturday urged the pope to take action against abuses and ensure justice for
  abuse victims worldwide.  Holy Father, I ask that you use your office and influence
  to ensure that this is done here in Ireland and across the world,  he said, calling
  the scandals a  stain  on the Church and state. The pope met eight abuse victims
  on Saturday, including a woman assaulted by a priest when she was in hospital aged
  13. On the plane to Rome, Francis said he  suffered a lot  at the meeting. He also
  said he was particularly moved by the plight of unmarried girls forced to give up
  their children for adoption.  I had never heard of it,  he said.  It was painful
  for me, but accompanied by the consolation of being able to help clarify these things.  The
  Church s standing has been badly dented by the abuse scandals and the Irish have
  shed traditional Catholic mores, voting earlier this year to legalise abortion after
  approving same-sex marriage in 2015. Multiple probes in Ireland have found Church
  leaders protected hundreds of predatory priests and former Irish president Mary
  McAleese revealed this month that the Vatican had sought to keep Church documents
  inaccessible to government investigators. The abuse scandals in Ireland are part
  of a worldwide crisis for the Vatican. A devastating report earlier this month accused
  more than 300 priests in the US state of Pennsylvania of abusing more than 1,000
  children since the 1950s. Published in Daily Times, August 28th 2018.        '

text: ' I am a Pakistani-American, one who straddles two distinct cultures. Living
  in both Pakistan and America, my take home lesson about politics in both countries
  is this; the power systems on both sides have the ultimate power over all that matters.
  In July, there was an opinion piece published in the New York Times, which alleges
  that the powerful establishment led by the Army in Pakistan has always created a
  king s party to further their agenda and smash the party the establishment didn
  t like. The author goes on to suggest based on-for lack of a better word-whim, that
  PTI is the King s party today. Most of the noise on social media is made by the
  PTI stalwarts   who obviously deny being the King s party   and those journalists,
  anchors, and book authors who regard the Times article as a Godsend for their ritualistic
  Imran Khan bashing. On social media, they are usually referred to as lifafa journalists.
  The Times article is interesting not for what it says, but for what it doesn t say.
  Conspicuous by its absence from the Times article is the issue of campaign finance
  in American elections. All cultures and races have different versions of the same
  thing. Some are visible to the naked eye, others can only be seen with eyes closed.
  In America, the caucasians smoke Marlboro lights while African-Americans smoke menthol
  cigarettes. Pakistani doctors drive BMWs or Mercedes and so do the Arabs, who smoke
  shisha with their food, while Pakistanis drink black tea with theirs. The point
  is that everyone has a unique manner of doing things. In America, I have worked
  at gas stations and have taught at colleges. I have dealt with people stealing soda
  cans and I have also sat down one on one with Noam Chomsky. Having seen many layers
  of American society, I know that America too has King s parties. The Republican
  and the Democratic parties are King s parties. Their Kings are the rich corporations.
  Having seen many layers of American society, I know that America too has king s
  parties. In fact, both Republican and the Democratic parties are kings  parties.
  Their kings are the rich corporations The role of money is not new in American politics.
  However, in the wake of the US supreme Court decision in the Citizens United v FEC
  case in 2010, it has become legal for unlimited cash to manipulate American elections.
  In the 5-4 court decision, the majority opinion argues that corporations have the
  same First Amendment rights as individuals. Political Action Committees (PACs) existed
  before with some limitations on their donations. But Citizens United case paved
  the way for Super PACs with virtually no limitations on the size of donation to
  a candidate during an election campaign. The new normal is for corporations to drench
  the election campaign with massive amounts of cash using Super PACs to influence
  elections. Positive campaign ads for the blue eyed candidate are aired, while at
  the same time malicious ads are aired targeting the opponent. The candidate with
  more money at his disposal usually wins. The winner then has to put his weight behind
  the kind of legislation that will help the  sugar daddy  corporation. The vicious
  cycle goes on. In the meantime, the biggest losers are the American public and the
  American democracy. The only winner is the King. The people s speech is just words
  while the corporations  speech is cash. Guess who is going to win, cash or words?
  Many Super PACs make hefty donations to election campaigns of the Republicans, the
  party that worships the Second Amendment right: the right to bear arms. The National
  Rifle Association (NRA) spends a stupendous amount of money in creating  awareness  about
  the importance of self-defense and the Second Amendment. The irony is that gun violence
  claims more American lives than terrorism, yet the Super PACs supporting gun rights
  are not deemed dangerous.  The National Rifle Association spends a stupendous amount
  of money in creating  awareness  about the importance of self-defence and the Second
  Amendment. The irony is that gun violence claims more American lives than terrorism
  According to a 2016 study by Alex Nowrasteh at the Cato Institute, about 3,024 Americans
  have died from 1975 through 2015 due to foreign born terrorists. This number includes
  the 2,983 deaths from 9/11. In the same period, guns claimed 1.34 million American
  lives. That s about as many Americans as died in all the wars in American history
  since the American Revolution. Notwithstanding, the mindset is: foreign terrorists
  are more dangerous than the domestic shooter. Similarly, domestic buying of the
  White House, which I will discuss shortly, isn t considered detrimental to American
  democracy. However, foreign (Russian) meddling to influence the election outcome
  is deemed a more sinister plot to harm America and its democracy. Strange logic!
  In 2008, Obama raised roughly $750 million. In 2012, Obama raised $1.123 billion,
  while Romney raised $ 1.019 billion. Every subsequent election is costlier than
  the previous one. The 2008 election spending was $5.3 billion, $6 billion in 2012,
  and $6.6 billion in 2016. American Kings have their free speech and their favorite
  party. The interesting part is that they don t even hide in plain sight. It is deeply
  internalised that money is needed for campaigns and corporations  free speech ought
  to be respected. I would like to point out that Pakistani Kings try their best to
  hide, knowing full well that Pakistanis know what the truth is. American Kings don
  t have to hide because they have blunted the free speech of the American people
  by controlling their minds. That is a more sinister plot than the one that encourages
  a party   called the King s party.   The writer is currently a PhD candidate at

text: 'Human Rights Watch (HRW) has drawn the attention of the newly-elected Prime
  Minister to a wide-ranging agenda that deserves the immediate and full consideration
  of his cabinet. Not least because the global watchdog has outlined a preliminary
  roadmap to redress the historic rights deficit here in Pakistan, covering: freedom
  of expression; freedom of religious belief; violence against women and girls; access
  to education; outlawing the death penalty; and counter-terrorism. Indeed, we would
  like to remind Mr Khan that the country is a signatory to the Universal Declaration
  of Human Rights (UDHR). And that the Pakistan Constitution guarantees a number of
  fundamental citizenry safeguards. To be sure, Kaptaan and his team have some hard
  work ahead of them if they are to realise the dream of Naya Pakistan for all.  The
  starting point of which must be the protection of rights for everyone. Indeed, the
  benchmark for any state with pretensions of being a liberal and tolerant democracy
  is inherently tied up with the treatment of minorities. In the current global climate
  where all eyes are fixed on the potential execution of a woman human rights defender
  in Saudi Arabia   it becomes an inconvenience to recall that Pakistan s Asia Bibi
  risks being the first woman in this country to face the death penalty for alleged
  blasphemy. Towards this end, HRW has urged the Khan government to amend the relevant
  laws as first step towards ultimate repeal; as well as doing away with the ban on
  the Ahmadi right to religious practice. Sadly, the breathing space has been co-opted
  by the violent religious right to such a dangerous extent that even considering
  such moves is to invite bloody and murderous consequences. Yet to maintain the status
  quo is to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Thus the new set-up has the next five years
  to change the narrative and initiate dialogue on both these fronts. What cannot
  be repeated is a situation whereby a sitting MPA launches uninterrupted an anti-Ahmadi
  tirade on the floor of the National Assembly. Linked to this is violence against
  women and girls. Given that those belonging to minority backgrounds are doubly prone
  to abuse; including forced conversion. Yet even when discounting this double burden
  of oppression, it becomes clear that Pakistan is not a safe country for women.  Child
  marriage is a concern. As is domestic abuse and so-called honour killings. What
  is therefore needed is for the entire political leadership to lead by example. This
  must begin with ending unwholesome tendencies to police the clothes and behaviour
  of women supporters belonging to rival parties. Similarly, the pitting of notions
  of western feminism against of those of the East does no one any good; least of
  all women themselves. The point is that the new regime, including the opposition,
  must work hard to help women reclaim the public space in terms of not just the physical
  realm but also when it comes to the law and general red tape. It is not sufficient
  for parties to have separate women s wings. All men lawmakers must prove themselves
  to be worthy allies. For the legacy of Naya Pakistan will be found in a gendered
  approach to rights that is equally cognisant of the burden too long borne by minorities.
  We believe the PTI government  Khan  achieve this if it has the will.  * Published

text: 'The first Muslim Prime Minister (PM) of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)Sheikh Mohammad
  Abdullah viewed the accession of the state to India as a strategic and pragmatic
  necessity, and sought to justify it by deploying the rhetoric of socialism and secularism.
  Regardless, he continued to harbour hopes for the creation of a sovereign Kashmir.
  In October 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India reinforced the stipulation that
  New Delhi s jurisdiction in the state would remain limited to the categories of
  defence, foreign affairs, and communications, as underlined in the Instrument of
  Accession. This stipulation was provisional and its final status would be decided
  upon the resolution of the Kashmir issue. Subsequent to India acquiring the status
  of a Republic in 1950, this constitutional provision enabled the incorporation of
  Article 370 into the Indian Constitution, which ratified the autonomous status of
  J&K within the Indian Union. Article 370 stipulates that New Delhi can legislate
  on the subjects of defence, foreign affairs, and communications only in just and
  equitable consultation with the government of the state of J&K. It can intervene
  on other subjects only with the consent of the J&K Assembly. At this point in time,
  Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah made some controversial observations in an interview with
  the London Observer. He voiced his concern over the increased vulnerability and
  instability of J&K caught between two countries that were hostile towards each other.
  He expressed his solicitude over the political and economic hardships that the location
  of the state would cause its populace. The only viable option, according to him,
  was for J&K to have a neutral status vis- -vis both India and Pakistan. However,
  because of the ruptured politics within the state given its diverse political, religious
  and ethnic affiliations, the sovereign and autonomous status of J&K would need to
  be acknowledged and guaranteed not just by India and Pakistan, but also by the UN
  and other world powers. Abdullah s candid observations created a furore in New Delhi.
  His  politically incorrect  views met with particular objection from India s right-wing
  Deputy Prime Minister, Vallabhbhai Patel. Abdullah withdrew his remarks in an interview
  with The Hindu, a couple of months later (Dasgupta 1968: 194). In 1952, Sheikh Mohammad
  Abdullah voiced his relentless hostility towards Hindutva majoritarianism in the
  stronghold of the right-wing Praja Parishad. He referred to the attempts of the
  Congress Party and the central government to enforce the complete integration of
  J&K into the Indian Union as juvenile, impractical and ludicrous (ibid.: 196). Sheikh
  Mohammad Abdullah came from an unpretentious Muslim background, and was motivated
  to fight the structural inequities and state-sponsored injustices wrought by the
  peripheralisation of Kashmiri Muslims In March 1952, Abdullah stated,  neither the
  Indian Parliament nor any other Parliament outside the state has any jurisdiction
  over our state  No country   neither India nor Pakistan   can put spokes in the
  wheel of our progress  (Delhi Radio, Indian Information Service). He further declared
  that  the existence of Kashmir did not depend on Indian money, trade, or defence
  forces, and he did not expect any strings to be attached to Indian aid. Threats
  and taunts would not intimidate him into servile submission (The Times, 26 April
  1952). Perhaps it was an irony of fate that, soon after Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah
  s talks with Nehru regarding the Kashmir imbroglio, Nehru died on 27 May 1964. Prior
  to the change in Nehru s stance towards Kashmir, the two stalwarts had shared a
  commonality of vision: they were tied by an umbilical cord of anti-despotic, socialist
  political beliefs. Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah came from an unpretentious Muslim background,
  and was motivated to fight the structural inequities and state-sponsored injustices
  wrought by the peripheralisation of Kashmiri Muslims who were quarantined in the
  alleyways of poverty, illiteracy and despondency. Nehru came from an elite background,
  had been groomed in the privileged hallways of Harrow and Cambridge, and was a proud
  personage, often arrogant or condescendingly superior in manner. His intellectual
  grooming exacerbated his patronising tone and manner. Despite the fact that the
  two figures, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and Nehru, occupied different rungs of the
  social and economic hierarchy, the rapport between them was of critical importance
  to the installation of a democratic regime in Kashmir in 1947. Subsequent to his
  talks with the Indian premier, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah travelled to Pakistan with
  Maulana Masoodi and Mirza Afzal Beg, in sanguineness and good cheer, to hold talks
  with the Pakistani President, General Ayub Khan. After a series of hopeful conversations
  with Ayub Khan, Abdullah felt confident that the talks were making headway. He visited
  Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, and was exuberantly
  welcomed by a sea of people (ibid.: 240). During that period, Abdullah did not once
  waver on his demand for self-rule, but he required the cooperation of Pakistan in
  looking for a viable solution to the conflict. The heart-warming response to Abdullah
  and his stance, particularly in the Kashmir Valley, was not well received either
  by New Delhi or its ward at the time, GM Sadiq.  Subsequent to Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah
  s death, even those who had vehemently condemned the political strategies, assessed
  his politics positively. An old associate of his who had migrated to Pakistan, Shahnawaz
  Khan Niazi, describes what he thought Abdullah symbolised:  Sheikh Abdullah was
  a total idealist and his only interest was the best deal he could get for Kashmir
  and Kashmiris. His often repeated statement to me was that destiny had played an
  important role, that circumstances were such that they did not permit him to come
  to an understanding with Pakistan. Every small opportunity he got to make a point
  or establish the separate identity of Kashmiris he took.  (Quoted in Taseer 1986:
  67) Despite the furious opposition of his detractors and the relentless efforts
  of the governments of India and Pakistan to delimit Abdullah s sphere of influence,
  and to dismantle the paradigmatic political and cultural structures built by him,
  his significance as a symbol of Kashmir s unique cultural identity and its stentorian
  demand for self-determination remains indelible. The writer is the author of Fiction

text: 'In 1994, when the Taliban burst upon the scene in Kandahar there was a reluctant
  recognition in Pakistan, that given their astonishing success they could perhaps
  bring peace to Afghanistan at a time when Pakistan s efforts to mediate peace between
  the Afghan factions had failed. This was when the Americans had walked away from
  the region and when other regional powers appeared intent on supporting the factions
  they favoured, caring little for the overall stability of the country. It was also
  when the Mujahideen were busy wreaking greater destruction on Afghanistan than it
  had suffered during the decade long Soviet occupation. We were not alone in this.
  Similar hopes were entertained by the Americans who also sought advantages from
  Afghanistan s location. Our hopes were belied. The Northern Alliance continued to
  hold territory in the North and this rump regime enjoyed recognition and support
  from India, Iran and Russia. The world worried about the Al-Qaeda presence in Afghanistan.
  This was the situation when New York was attacked and a multi flawed US operation
  began The following mistakes   certainly not a comprehensive list   that the Americans
  made in Afghanistan justifiably aroused suspicions and misgivings about their intentions.
  First, in 1996, when Taliban control over a large part of Afghanistan had been consolidated,
  they allowed Bin Laden to fly to Afghanistan from Sudan. In Sudan he was under the
  careful eye of a Sudanese government anxious to keep on the good side of the Americans.
  In Afghanistan, he was revered as a hero of the Jihad in which the Taliban leaders
  had participated as foot soldiers. Second, in their relentless search for Al-Qaeda,
  the US resurrected the warlords, who had gone under cover during the Taliban rule,
  and handed over generous amounts of dollars. They turned a blind eye to the resumption
  of poppy cultivation that had virtually disappeared in the last year of Taliban
  rule. Moreover, they picked up and took to Guantanamo many innocent Afghans fingered
  by these warlords as part of personal vendettas or as part of the struggle for influence
  in their area of operation. Third, they failed to use their own troops to eliminate
  Bin Laden and his followers when they were trapped in Tora Bora. Instead, they relied
  upon Afghan mercenaries with the predictable consequence that either by bribery
  or by devotion, these Afghans permitted Bin Laden to cross into Pakistan and saddled
  us with the problem. Our role in the GWOT was to cleanse our own territory of terrorist
  groups, a task we would have had to undertake eventually Fourth, they convened a
  Bonn Conference from which the Taliban and most Pashtuns were excluded, making intentionally
  or otherwise, the Taliban the representatives of Pashtun nationalism.  Fifth and
  most importantly, they rejected or forced Karzai to reject the Taliban offer to
  return to Afghanistan and live as ordinary citizens in return for amnesty. Sixth,
  they did this as part of a larger scheme to remake the Middle East. They were planning
  a war on Iraq and diverting resources and political attention from Afghanistan.
  Common sense would have dictated that if resources were no longer available for
  Afghanistan, the Taliban should have been granted the amnesty they sought and reduced
  American involvement in Afghanistan to the rebuilding of a country that had been
  more devastated by internecine warfare than by the years of Soviet occupation. Much
  could have been different if the Americans had behaved differently. The important
  point however is that apart from the assistance we provided to the Americans for
  their plans in Afghanistan   our part in the Global War of Terror was to cleanse
  our own areas   a task we would have had to undertake irrespective of what the Americans
  did or did not do in Afghanistan. This was our war and in many ways independent
  of the war waged in Afghanistan. How did our areas become hotbeds of extremism?
  This was at least partly the direct result of the policy of our rulers of the day.
  We had, along with the Americans and then the Saudis and others supported the Afghan  freedom
  fighters  in their struggle against the Soviet occupation. General Ziaul Haq, our
  ruler at that time was anxious to ensure the consolidation of his version of Islam
  in Pakistan. He wanted to use the Afghan Jihad for this purpose. Therefore, he decided
  that the Jihad was to be waged with the slogan of  Islam in Danger  rather than
  the mildly offered American suggestion supported by some of the Mujahideen that
  the deposed King Zahir Shah be brought back from Rome and under his leadership the
  slogan of  Afghan nationalism  be used. The Americans were in this game only to
  impose on the Russians the same humiliation that the Vietnamese had inflicted on
  the Americans. They were prepared to let us determine how this war was to be waged
  and to help us with such things as bringing extremists, among them Osama Bin Laden,
  from all parts of the Muslim world to Peshawar to wage a Jihad against the infidel
  Soviets alongside their Muslim Afghan brothers. We set up this chain of Madaris
  along our border to train Afghans, and unfortunately Pakistanis for the Jihad; and
  entrusted their running to Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the JUI. The Americans then
  helped us devise curricula for the Madaris and this included gems such as an arithmetic
  book which taught addition by saying  One Kalashnikov plus three Kalashnikovs is
  equal to 4 Kalashnikovs . They were prepared to go along with whatever we proposed
  with regard to the many Afghan Mujahideen groups that existed at that time and to
  let us determine the level of assistance each would receive. In one fell stroke,
  we reduced the 29 Afghan parties that existed to seven and decided that of them
  Gulbuddin Hikmatyar s Hizbe Islami (a largely Pashtun Party) rather than Rabbani
  and Ahmad Shah Masood s Jamiate Islami (a largely Tajik party) would be the principal
  recipient of assistance. We were in this Jihad, as the tail that wagged the dog,
  and when the results of our efforts produced not just the Soviet withdrawal from
  Afghanistan but the disintegration of the Soviet Union, there was this heady feeling
  of invincibility in our policy circles. What did we gain? We could complete the
  work needed to ensure a working nuclear weapon capability while the Americans turned
  a not so blind eye towards this development but for the rest we have only loss to
  show for our efforts. This I will dilate on in my next column. Concluded The writer

  \ here and abroad.Perhaps, this solid NPAG background has permitted Shakir Ali Museum\
  \ Director Amna Pataudi to announce classical and folk dance competitions between\
  \ private performers and those from different educational institutions at the museum\
  \ from next month. \u201CThe doors of Shakir Ali Museum are open for the promotion\
  \ of classical and folk dances woven deep into the dance traditions of this region.\
  \ That is why we will like to invite private dance performers and students from\
  \ different institutions to be the part of our competitions to be held after every\
  \ three months gap.\u201D The jury to judge these competitions will be based on\
  \ eminent choreographers, including Zarin Pana from NPAG. Ms Pataudi said the need\
  \ for holding such competitions was felt because there were no first-rate classical\
  \ dancers in line after prominent names such as Naheed Siddiqui, Nighat Chuadhry,\
  \ Beena Jawad and Dr Saga. The director told Dawn on Wednesday NPAG would hold frequent\

  \ in and organising such events abroad. \u201CThe group will perform at the Shakir\
  \ Ali Museum after every two months freshly learnt dances in near future,\u201D\
  \ she said. NPAG, the high-scale dance wing of PNCA established in 2006, has hired\
  \ dancers for training newcomers. The group has inspired choreographers such as\
  \ Roshan Ara Bokhari and Zarin Pana to share their expertise with it. Currently,\
  \ Ms Pana is heading the group as choreographer. Zafar Dilawar who is teacher with\
  \ the group said the performers were being taught six to seven dances every year.\
  \ By now, they have learnt over 100 dances, including Peacock Dance, Candle Dance,\
  \ Cotton Picker\u2019s Dance, Basant Bhar Dance, Jhoomar, Harvest Dance, Dhamal,\
  \ Luddi, and Bhangra, besides Katthak and other forms of classical dance. Though\
  \ the dancers at NPAG were confident that they would change the dance scene in the\
  \ country given the kind of training they had been given all these years, they deplored\
  \ the lack of opportunities to show their skills."

  \ UN assistant secretary for political affairs, Oscar Fernandez Taranco, who wound\
  \ up a visit to Bangladesh on Wednesday confirmed the phone calls by the world\u2019\

  \ League party and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) held one-to-one\
  \ talks for the first time in years in a bid to defuse the row.BNP and its smaller\

  \ clashes since late October when the BNP-led 18-party opposition movement launched\
  \ the protests calling on Hasina to resign and make way for the polls under a neutral\
  \ caretaker government.The opposition, led by Hasina\u2019s rival Khaleda Zia, has\
  \ said it fears the premier will try to rig the vote in a country plagued by coups\
  \ and political upheaval for decades.Hasina has rejected the demands for her resignation\
  \ and is determined to hold the polls as scheduled, insisting it is a constitutional\
  \ requirement.Observers said although the two parties have held two rounds of talks,\
  \ decades of distrust mean it is unlikely a deal is immediately in the cards.UN\
  \ envoy Fernandez-Taranco said a third meeting between the parties has been agreed\
  \ but more must be done to build confidence.\u201CThere are measures that would\
  \ contribute immensely: a call by all sides to end the violence, release of opposition\

  \ election schedule,\u201D he told a press briefing.\u201CThe leaders have shown\
  \ statesmanship. It remains critical to reduce tension and to continue to engage\

  \ plan to go ahead with the polls without the BNP suffered a major blow last week\
  \ when her key ally \u2014 the Jatiya Party, the third-largest political organisation\
  \ in the country, led by ex-military dictator Hussain Muhammad Ershad \u2014 announced\

  ve snapped a photo of himself at a funeral,\u201D commented the right-wing Fox News.\u201C\
  Mr Mandela was a man who forgave others for some of the cruellest acts against mankind.\

  \ dancing, singing and laughing to honour their departed leader. It was more like\
  \ a carnival atmosphere, not at all morbid. The ceremony had already gone on for\
  \ two hours and would last another two. The atmosphere was totally relaxed \u2014\

  \ their livelihood from the industry.According to PSRMA Chairman Asmat Pervaiz Malik,\

text: "ISLAMABAD, Dec 11: On the last day of his eight-year tenure on Wednesday, Chief\
  \ Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry took up the Balochistan missing persons\u2019\
  \ case and handed down an order. The proceedings of the case saw a verbal clash\
  \ between a counsel and the bench. Heading a three-judge Supreme Court bench which\
  \ had issued a contempt notice to Inspector General of Frontier Corps Balochistan\
  \ Maj Gen Ijaz Shahid, the chief justice ordered that the next-in-command in the\
  \ force be immediately appointed in place of the FC chief who was indisposed and\
  \ admitted to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology. When Brigadier Khalid Saleem,\
  \ who is at present heading the force, tried to explain that none of the missing\
  \ persons was in the FC custody, the court said that without a proper notification\
  \ by the interior ministry about his charge he could not be considered to be legally\
  \ holding the command. After the notification, the order said, the acting FC chief\
  \ would ensure that the FC personnel allegedly involved in enforced disappearances\
  \ appeared before DIG of Balochistan Crime Investigation Department Imtiaz Ahmed\
  \ Shah in compliance with the earlier order. It said the new FC chief, along with\
  \ the provincial police and other law-enforcement agencies, would also ensure recovery\
  \ of the missing persons, including Advocate Mir Ahmed Marwani who had been picked\
  \ up from Khuzdar in Balochistan. The new FC chief, the Balochistan chief secretary\
  \ and the inspector general of police are required to appear before the Supreme\
  \ Court on Dec 17 along with reports on progress in recovery of the missing persons.\
  \ The court said that since former FC chief Obaidullah Khattak had earlier given\
  \ an undertaking in the court, all those who had affixed their signatures on the\
  \ commitment to recover the missing persons would also appear before it to explain\
  \ whether they had met the commitment. The court regretted that despite protests\
  \ by relatives of the missing persons, no-one took practical steps to redress their\
  \ grievances. This is evident from the attitude of law-enforcement agencies as well\
  \ as elected representatives who had promised to enforce fundamental rights in their\
  \ election campaigns. \u201CSimilar is the position of the federal government, the\
  \ prime minister and his cabinet as well as the elected representatives, particularly\
  \ from Balochistan, despite the fact that they are aware of the miseries of the\
  \ Baloch people,\u201D the court said. It observed that it was a responsibility\
  \ of the executive authorities discharging functions under the constitution to enforce\
  \ fundamental rights. The court regretted that there had been a hue and cry for\
  \ many years and relatives of the missing persons were continuously holding camps\
  \ in Quetta and even marched to Karachi on foot with their children, women and the\
  \ elderly demanding their recovery. ACRIMONY: At the outset of the proceedings an\
  \ exchange of words took place between the bench and Advocate Irfan Qadir, representing\
  \ FC chief Maj Gen Ijaz Shahid. When Mr Qadir, a former attorney general, insisted\
  \ that he should be heard, the court said that the right of audience could not be\
  \ granted until the FC chief himself appeared to face the contempt charge. He quoted\
  \ a headline in a section of the press that a \u201Cpolitical superstar is born\u201D\
  \ and said that if it was true he would not like to leave his client at the mercy\
  \ of the superstar. And if it was wrong, he said, the court should proceed against\
  \ the media house under Section 8 of the Contempt of the Court Ordinance 2003 so\
  \ that such stories were not published again. The court asked the counsel not to\
  \ force it to take strict action against him. Otherwise, it warned, he could be\
  \ charged for committing contempt at the face of the court under the Supreme Court\
  \ Rules which could entail suspension or permanent cancellation of his licence to\
  \ practice in the Supreme Court. Mr Qadir said he had not committed any contempt\
  \ and all that he wanted was an action against the newspaper. He alleged that the\
  \ bench was sitting with a mindset and getting personal. The court said it was exercising\
  \ restraint and asked the counsel not to be loud in the court. Now it has become\
  \ a question of the dignity of the court. At this Attorney General Muneer A. Malik\
  \ stepped in to request the court to exercise judicial restraint since Mr Qadir\
  \ was his predecessor. The chief justice observed that the power to suspend a licence\
  \ could be exercised by the chief justice straightaway. But the counsel said the\
  \ court could not go ahead or even revoke his licence without hearing him and emphasised\
  \ that the Supreme Court rules were subservient to Article 10-A of the Constitution\
  \ which ensures fair trial. But despite the expectation after intervention by the\
  \ attorney general, Mr Qadir did not offer any remorse or apology, but only demanded\
  \ fair trial from the bench. Detainees\u2019 death: In its Tuesday\u2019s judgment\
  \ in the Adiyala Jail detainees case, the Supreme Court had declared that the death\
  \ of four detainees during custody could not be proved to have been caused by torture,\
  \ thus their death should be considered as natural. The judgment said: \u201CRegarding\
  \ the death of the 4 detainees, the respondents No. 2 to 4 with their reply (CMA\
  \ No. 487 of 2012) have attached their death certificates which show that Syed Abdus\
  \ Saboor expired on 20.01.2011 in LRH due to cardio pulmonary arrest, respiratory\
  \ distress. Tehseenullah expired on 17.12.2011 in LRH due to cardio pulmonary arrest.\
  \ Said Arab expired on 18.12.2011 in LRH due to cardio pulmonary arrest, secondary\
  \ to anaemia and pancyctopaeshia. Muhammad Aamir alias Khalid expired on 13.08.2011\
  \ due to acute renal failure and acute gastroenteritis.\u201D"

  \ nominally in charge of the FSA, and weapons warehouses at the Bab al-Hawa crossing\

  \ US-allied groups. The United States has been concerned the non-lethal aid should\
  \ not reach Islamists.A senior US administration official said that the suspension\
  \ should not be misinterpreted.\u201CThis is absolutely not the beginning of the\

  \ He said the administration was looking for other ways to see how the support can\
  \ be provided to ensure it does not fall into the hands of \u201Cextremists\u201D\

  \ was elected on Wednesday chairman of the Public Accounts Committee of the National\
  \ Assembly.Mr Shah was unanimously chosen as head of the PAC at its meeting held\
  \ at the Parliament House. Bashir Ahmad Virk proposed and Javed Akhlas of the PML-N\
  \ seconded his name.After his election, Mr Shah announced that the committee would\
  \ formally meet on Dec 31.Besides taking up regular audit reports from 1998 onwards,\
  \ the litmus test for Mr Shah-led PAC would be pending audit paras in the Rs2 billion\
  \ NLC scam, lease of railways land to a social club in Lahore and summoning the\
  \ Supreme Court registrar before the committee for scrutiny of SC expenditure.When\
  \ the previous PAC took up the NLC case and held three retired generals responsible\
  \ for losses in the cell, former army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani announced\
  \ that the GHQ would investigate the case. The investigation report is still awaited.Since\
  \ the audit para is still pending before the committee, it would surely be taken\
  \ up by its new members.The lease of railways land to Royal Palm Golf and Country\
  \ Club in Lahore remained under discussion in the previous PAC. Federal auditors\
  \ claimed that the lease of 141 acres of land resulted in over Rs10 billion loss\
  \ to the national exchequer. Although the case is pending before the court, its\
  \ audit para had to be settled by the PAC.The previous PAC had repeatedly asked\
  \ the SC registrar to appear before it for mandatory presentation of accounts, but\
  \ a full court sitting stopped the registrar from doing so.When asked if he will\
  \ summon the SC registrar, Mr Shah said the PAC would follow the constitutional\
  \ provision that a government organisation that received funds from the national\
  \ kitty had to appear before the committee.Audit reports from 2008 to 2011, when\
  \ the PPP was in power, are ready to be taken up by the new PAC. Mr Shah said the\
  \ PAC would work above party lines and that\u2019s how it could carry out across-the-board\
  \ accountability.The PAC chairman said he would not meet principal accounting officers\
  \ of government organisations to ensure transparency in the working of the committee.\
  \ Instead, the additional secretary of the committee will hold meetings.Asked if\
  \ he would use suo motu powers, Mr Shah replied in the negative.Meanwhile, the government\

text: '  MINNEAPOLIS: Two people were killed and nine injured on Wednesday after a
  gas explosion ripped through a Christian private school in Minneapolis, US starting
  a fire and causing a building to collapse, authorities said. The body of a school
  employee was recovered at 8 pm CDT from the rubble at the Minnehaha Academy, about
  10 hours after the explosion, Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel told a news conference.
  Fruetel declined to identify either victim pending notification of next of kin.
  The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that the remains removed earlier in the day
  were those of Ruth Berg, a 47-year-old receptionist at the school who was engaged
  to be married. Family members earlier told local news channel KARE that John Carlson,
  an 81-year-old custodian, was missing and that no one had been able to reach him.
  The nine people who were injured were taken to local hospitals, and one was in critical
  condition, Fruetel said. The school was not in session due to summer break, Fruetel
  said.  It would have been dramatically worse   we were pretty lucky in that sense,  he
  said. Authorities said there were early indications that a ruptured gas line may
  have led to the explosion and that it was caused by contractors working at the school.
  The academy confirmed on Facebook that there had been a gas leak and explosion at
  its Upper School.  This is a day of extraordinary heartbreak in Minneapolis,  Mayor
  Betsy Hodges told the news conference. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
  and Explosives said on Twitter its agents, fire investigators and trained canines
  were at the site of the explosion. Phillip Day, 41, said he, his wife and their
  17-year-old daughter, Chimali, had been meeting a counsellor at the school to discuss
  college options when the explosion occurred. Day said that, as they left a conference
  room, his daughter was blown back through the door by the force of the blast and
  his wife was scraped. Tramon Van Leer, 33, was in the gym at the Minnehaha Academy
  playing basketball with his stepdaughter and four other girls when they heard the
  blast. After they ran outside to safety, Van Leer said he looked back and said:  Wow,
  the whole section of the school is gone.  According to its website, Minnehaha Academy
  was founded in 1913 and teaches more than 800 students from pre-kindergarten through
  12th grade on two campuses.   Related '

  for the hajj, authorities said Thursday, with the annual pilgrimage marked by the
  return of Iranians after Tehran s boycott last year. More than two million people
  are expected to participate in this year s hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable
  Muslims must perform at least once in their lives, which starts next week.  So far
  1,313,946 pilgrims have arrived by air, 79,501 by land, and 12,477 by sea   an increase
  of 33 percent compared with the same period last year,  the state-run Saudi Press
  Agency said, citing passport officials. That includes more than 400 Qatari pilgrims,
  local media reported, despite an intensifying row between Doha and Riyadh over arrangements
  for the religious event. All Qatari pilgrims arrived through the Salwa border crossing
  with Qatar. The hajj has been clouded by the worst political crisis in the Gulf
  in decades, with Saudi Arabia leading a four-state bloc that suspended all ties
  with Doha on June 5 over accusations the emirate backed Islamist extremists. Qatar
  has denied the charge and said this week it was worried pilgrims from the emirate
  would be treated badly. But the Saudi media has repeatedly broadcast images showing
  officials courteously assisting Qatari pilgrims. The hajj ministry has said the
  kingdom, home to Islam s holiest sites, welcomes all pilgrims from different nationalities.
  The ministry added it was equipped to handle the additional crowds after the completion
  of expansion works at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the most revered site in Islam.
  More than 1.8 million faithful took part in last year s hajj. But Iran s 64,000
  pilgrims stayed away for the first time in three decades after tensions between
  Riyadh and Tehran boiled over following a deadly stampede during the 2015 pilgrimage.
  An agreement was reached earlier this year to allow Iranians to take part in the
  hajj. Iran and Saudi Arabia will soon exchange diplomatic visits, Tehran said this
  week, in a possible sign of tensions easing after the archrivals cut ties last year.

  the country, but one thing transcends region, religion, ethnicity, age and political
  affiliation. That thing is cricket. It s the most popular sport in the country,
  with heroes from the game independently going on to inspire generations. It unites
  the whole nation, and makes you forget about any political differences. That s the
  value of cricket to Pakistan. It s an Eid of cricket in Karachi, a city of over
  20 million cricket-mad people that hasn t played host to a game of this magnitude
  for over nine years. Peshawar Zalmi are set to take on Islamabad United in a high-voltage
  PSL final at National Stadium Karachi   a venue set to host its first high-profile
  game since the Pakistan-Sri Lanka Test in February 2009. The game is billed as a
  homecoming, what with Pakistan s biggest city having been deprived of major cricket
  for almost a decade. The focus of the event has been the extraordinary security
  in the city, but there s plenty to focus on as far as the cricket is concerned,
  too. Both teams have one PSL title to their name, with Peshawar being defending
  champions, while Islamabad won the inaugural edition in 2016. Both are presently
  at the top of their game and made their way to the final with some brutal displays
  with the bat. There seems to be no real weak link in either team, as both are laden
  with experienced batsmen from top to middle, and boast powerful bowling attacks.
  The stadium has, over the years, largely been isolated, only hosting domestic cricket,
  but the infrastructure was put back together a few months before the game. The stadium
  is still under renovation, but the facility was prepared enough to make sure it
  was able to get going for the important game. The final is anticipated for its own
  merits as a contest, of course, but an absorbing mini-contest revolves around the
  dazzling form of each side s wicketkeeper-batsman. Kamran Akmal and Luke Ronchi
  are both 36, have both been opening the batting, and presently sit at No. 1 and
  No. 3 on the PSL run charts with 424 and 383 runs respectively. Both are major reasons
  for their respective teams making the final this season. Both have exhibited extraordinary
  skill in power-hitting, and are brimming with the confidence, and will be at the
  forefront of their respective opposition bowling attacks leading into the game.
  Despite safety concerns among foreign players overshadowing the games themselves,
  both teams have managed to retain the services of most of their best overseas players
  for the marquee game. This was in stark contrast to last year, when all of Quetta
  Gladiators  foreign players pulled out while Peshawar Zalmi fielded a full-strength
  side. Misbah ul Haq missed the Qualifier with a hairline fracture in his wrist.
  The 43-year-old has been struggling for fitness, and will miss the final. Islamabad
  are likely to stick to their combination from the Dubai game where they beat Karachi
  Kings by eight wickets with 45 balls to spare. One enforced change will be the absence
  of Alex Hales, who pulled out due to security concerns. Islamabad United (likely):
  1 Luke Ronchi (wk), 2 Sahibzada Farhan, 3 JP Duminy (capt), 4 Hussain Talat, 5 Samit
  Patel, 6 Asif Ali, 7 Chadwick Walton/Samuel Badree, 8 Shadab Khan, 9 Faheem Ashraf,
  10 Mohammad Sami, 11 Amad Butt Kamran Akmal has been playing despite a stiff neck
  and a hamstring niggle but with three days of rest before the game should have had
  enough time to regain his fitness. Peshawar are likely to retain their winning combination.
  Peshawar Zalmi (likely): 1 Kamran Akmal (wk), 2 Andre Fletcher, 3 Mohammad Hafeez,
  4 Saad Nasim, 5 Liam Dawson, 6 Darren Sammy (capt), 7 Chris Jordan, 8 Hasan Ali,
  9 Wahab Riaz, 10 Umaid Asif, 11 Sameen Gul. Related '

  to the Independent Election Commission (IEC) information, the voter registration
  drive would be completed in two phases   first in cities and the second phase in
  districts centers and villages. However, the IEC extended the voter registration
  deadline for another month both in districts and provinces. A IEC list, available
  with Pajhwok Afghan News, shows that till yesterday s afternoon more than two million
  and 300,000 people have registered their names at voter registration centers nationwide.
  Based on the commission s information during the past 36 days, 23,18,040 individuals
  including 1597909 men and 668200 women were enrolled at voter registration centers.
  According to the established list, 51,494 Kuchis and 437 Hindus are among those
  registered so far. As fears were raised about stickers on ID cards, the Presidential
  Palace said those having problem with the sticker can put the sticker on the ID
  card copy, a decision to which the IEC finally agreed.     Related '

text: '  Monitoring Desk KABUL: An estimated 160,000 to 200,000 children under one
  year of age in Afghanistan   one in three   received zero vaccinations last year,
  the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) said in a statement on Wednesday. These gaps
  in routine immunization coverage not only put the lives of under-vaccinated children
  at risk but also everyone around them. Insecurity in parts of the country reduces
  access for health workers to reach children and for families to get to health clinics,
  while displaced populations and those living in remote areas are also more likely
  to miss out on vaccines.  Immunization is the right of every child, we must accelerate
  our efforts to ensure all children in the country are vaccinated and protected from
  preventable diseases,  said H.E. Minister for Public Health, Dr Ferozuddin Feroz.  Through
  immunization we can protect children from diseases, such as measles, polio and pneumonia   a
  major killer of children under 5 years of age,  Dr, Feroz added. The remarks come
  as Afghanistan marks,  World Immunization Week , which is celebrated annually, 24-30
  April, to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination and ensure that people
  take action to receive all required life-saving vaccines. The theme for 2018 is:  Protected
  Together, #VaccinesWork . Efforts to eradicate polio also continue in Afghanistan
  and most of the country remains polio-free. In 2018, there have been 7 polio cases,
  mostly restricted to high-risk areas in the southern and eastern regions.  We are
  seeing improvements in routine immunization coverage and new vaccines have been
  introduced,  said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative in Afghanistan.  But
  the country is still behind schedule on the targets for disease eradication and
  elimination, including polio, measles, rubella, and maternal and neonatal tetanus.
  We must make more concerted efforts to reach all Global Vaccine Action Plan goals
  by 2020,  Dr. Peeperkorn added. The Global Vaccine Action Plan was endorsed by the
  World Health Assembly in 2012 and is a commitment to ensure that no one misses out
  on vital immunization by 2020.  We must all commit to providing every child with
  the lifesaving vaccines they need,  said Stefano Savi, UNICEF s deputy representative
  in Afghanistan.  This includes reaching the most vulnerable children, who are often
  affected by conflict or living in the most remote areas of the country. Children
  in Afghanistan have the right to get the best start in life, to develop and progress
  like any child,  Savi added. Immunization saves millions of lives globally each
  year and is widely recognized as one of the world s most successful and cost-effective
  health interventions. Key facts and progress: The number of health centres providing
  immunization services increased by 12 per cent to 1,767 facilities around the country.
  In 2017, some 1,250,000 children, under one year old, were vaccinated in against
  measles, polio, whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria, pneumonia, meningitis and tuberculosis.
  In 2017, 900,000 pregnant women and children younger than 5 were provided with medicines
  for antenatal care, newborn care, pneumonia, diarrhoea and meningitis. 10 antigens
  are currently included in Afghanistan s routine immunization programme, available
  free of charge. In recent years, Afghanistan has introduced new vaccines, including
  the Pentavalent vaccine protecting people from five deadly diseases and the Pneumococcal
  vaccine to fight pneumonia. This year, the Ministry of Public Health introduced
  the Rota vaccine, it s hoped that this will significantly reduce mortality due to
  diarrhea in the country, From July to September 2018, a nationwide measles immunization
  campaign will target 14 million children, aged 10 months to five years.     Related '

  \ a safe haven for Pakistani bowlers.Had he not been replaced, just imagine the\
  \ mess Akmal would have made off Hashim Amla\u2019s nudge.Like countless sad stories\
  \ of dumping and nepotism in Pakistan Cricket, Sarfaraz is no stranger to hardships\
  \ and baseless criticism. Often sidelined for unexplained reasons, the street fighter\
  \ has the habit of crawling his way back through some stellar performances.Some\
  \ circles scared of his skills and leadership qualities have discouraged and deliberately\
  \ tried to keep him out of the team. During a recent tour, his visa was purposely\
  \ delayed and a fellow keeper kept on telling him that he will be replacing Sarfaraz\
  \ on the tour. Sarfaraz eventually went on the tour, though he was dropped soon\
  \ afterwards without given right opportunities.Right after the 2012 Asia Cup, he\
  \ was dubbed as \u201CNot a good enough batsman\u201D and was dropped from the next\
  \ outing.A further shock came with him not being awarded the Central Contract.Expecting\

text: 'KARACHI: The Federal Government and provinces are neither serious about nor
  taking an interest in holding population and housing census in the country. It s
  a legal obligation imposed on the Federal Government in the Federal Legislative
  list of fourth schedule to the Constitution; nevertheless, hurdles are being created
  to delay or stop the sixth census in Pakistan, as mentioned in Aam log Ittehad Petition
  filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. According to Petitioner Justice (retd) Wajihuddin
  Ahmed, Acting Chairman Aam Loeg Ittehad:  While the first four censuses were more
  or less regularly and duly held in the years 1951, 1961, 1972 and 1981, the fifth
  census was undertaken in 1998 after 17 years, an inordinate delay of 7 years which
  was certainly avoidable. That is not to say that the pervious censuses were problem
  free.  However, we are now in the 21st century and living in the Information Age,
  with little or no scope for such aberrations.  Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed said in
  a separate statement:  None of the governments are serious in the matter, though
  for different reasons. The Federal Government is engaged in a mechanical exercise,
  solely because it has to honor its undertaking before the apex court. The sardars
  and Khans of Balochistan and KP feel threatened that once their impecunious and
  burgeoning populations are quantified, their own lavish and luxurious lifestyles
  would come under scrutiny. The Sindh government, which exclusively represents rural
  Sindh, is determined to inflate the numbers in rural areas and decimate those in
  urban Sindh.  Justice Wajih further said that the census is an activity necessary
  to assess the needs on the basis of population, and this act will be beneficial
  for human rights. The petition points out that the leadership of Punjab is no wiser.
  It is fully aware that the proportion of their population is slowly declining and
  if census is held it would no longer be officially reflected as being 55.63% of
  the population of Pakistan. The estimated Punjab population, as per the 2011 Housing
  Census, is 47.69%. In the previous census of 1998, while a slower per annum growth
  rate of 2.64% in Punjab was recorded, Sindh registered a growth rate of 2.80% per
  annum. The petition further states that if this trend continues, it is bound to
  have a negative impact on the 148 National Assembly seats allocated to the province
  of Punjab under the Constitution. In order to maintain and ensure the numerical
  majority of the province of Punjab in the population census of Pakistan, some functionaries
  of the Punjab government are keen to have the exercise of the forthcoming census
  abandoned. The notables of Punjab need to realise that if the present population
  ratio of their province is unrealistically maintained and reflected to be higher
  than it actually is, history may repeat itself. In similar circumstances, the former
  province of East Pakistan, having a 54% share of the total population, seceded,
  not the least for the reason that the former province of West Pakistan was not in
  favour of the idea of remaining a permanent minority province, says the petition.
  The petition notes that the situation is particularly sensitive in Sindh because
  at this eleventh hour the government is proactively pursuing the issuance of CNICs
  in rural areas. It is no secret that the government of Sindh only and exclusively
  represents rural Sindh, with a predictable tilt in that direction. Its unchecked
  participation in the census exercise, which, as stated in the preceding paragraph,
  is a Federal subject/entry, occurring in Part II of the Federal Legislative List,
  controlled by Articles 153(4) and 154 (1) (6) ), is likely to produce unacceptable
  results. Aam Loeg Ittehad petition states that there is hue and cry in Balochistan
  that if the current census, in the present situation, is carried out the Baloch
  people shall be relegated to being a minority in their own province. Nothing can
  be farther from the truth. The Baloch people, who are purported to have moved to
  Sindh and Punjab, can easily be counted at their present places of residence.  And
  if some Afghan refugees, in Balochistan, now possess Pakistan CNICs, they can always
  be carefully screened and excluded from the head count of the forthcoming population
  census. Thereafter, their illegal Pakistan CNICs can be replaced by other distinctive
  cards of identification. Much the same is the position in KP, where provincial leaders
  have shown apprehension that if some migrants from Afghanistan, who are unlawfully
  holding Pakistan CNICs, are counted, as part of the population, the Pashtuns would
  be converted into a minority. That also is as illogical a position as taken by the
  Baloch sardars. For one thing, an inflated KP population would bring similar benefits,
  as in the case of Balochistan and in any case the electoral process would remain
  unaffected, as in the case of Balochistan, states the petition. It has been requested
  of the Honorable Court to direct the Federal Government to assume full jurisdiction
  in the matter of the forthcoming census and provide directions and guidance to the
  Council of Common Interests, as and when necessary. The Court has also been appealed
  to direct the Federal and Provincial Governments of Pakistan to ensure full, complete
  and absolute compliance of law and the Constitution in the matter of the forthcoming
  census. Census is not just for the head-count of Pakistani citizens (CNIC holders)
  but of all persons in Pakistan who must be counted on the basis of due and verifiable
  particulars and only after securing due clarification of valid CNIC holders. The
  petition has further requested the Court to issue directions to NADRA, through the
  Chair NADRA to cancel all illegal CNICs and, where needed, to issue other cards/insignias
  for identification of persons holding illegal CNICs. And also to prohibit NADRA
  from issuing new CNICs at least one month prior to the start of the first phase
  of the census. It has also been requested that the Court prohibit all Provincial
  Governments from any and all direct or indirect interaction with the census functionaries,
  and to ensure that no census result is announced until the Armed Forces  component
  of the census personnel expressly approves it. '

  so far this year, according to figures collected by AFP as India counts the rising
  toll from floods that have devastated southern Kerala state.  The monsoon, which
  lasts from June to September, causes widespread death and destruction across South
  Asia each year, with the tourist hotspot of Kerala suffering its worst floods in
  nearly 100 years. Kerala has reported 445 deaths with more bodies discovered each
  day as a massive cleanup gets underway. The floods forced more than a million people
  to seek shelter in temporary relief camps and 15 others were reported missing up
  to Monday.  Kerala accounted for nearly half of the more than 1,000 deaths reported
  across India, with over 160 killed in neighbouring Karnataka state, more than 200
  fatalities in Uttar Pradesh state, and 195 in West Bengal, according to official
  figures. The monsoon also battered Nepal, with 87 people killed since June, according
  to the home ministry, including a woman and eight children swept away by a landslide
  in a remote village. But in Sri Lanka, where authorities organised the early evacuation
  of 750,000 people in threatened areas this year, the death toll from monsoon floods
  fell to 24 from 224 killed in May and June last year, official figures showed. In
  Bangladesh, floods and landslides killed at least 29 people, according to official
  figures. In the deadliest monsoon-induced disaster in recent years in South Asia,
  flooding and landslides killed around 5,800 people in India s northern Uttarakhand

text: 'Many European Union member states have failed the migrant victims of torture
  and trauma by not having systems in place to recognise the ordeals they have suffered,
  and support them on arrival. Such trauma if left untreated can scar them and their
  families for life, and may lead to suicide. These are some of the findings from
  the latest summary report of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) on migration-related
  fundamental rights concerns in select EU member states. It examines how victims
  are being handled by national authorities to highlight how to best offer them the
  protection they are entitled to. Many migrants and asylum seekers have fled or experienced
  extreme suffering in their home countries or en route to Europe. This includes physical
  and psychological violence, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. Lengthy bureaucracy,
  uncertainty about the outcome of asylum proceedings and poor reception conditions
  can compound their suffering. In Denmark alone, there were 120 suicide attempts
  and incidents of suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in 2016, of which 29 were
  by children. Despite international and EU laws guarding against such treatment offering
  support to victims, many member states are falling short of their duties, the report
  shows. Some of the report s main findings include:  1. The true extent of suffering
  is hard to gauge as only limited data on the victims of torture and trauma and on
  suicide attempts is collected in the 13 member states studied. Only Greece regularly
  collects information on torture victims.  2.  Recurrent violence or the excessive
  use of force by state officials or those working on their behalf was not found although
  there were cases of individual and localised incidents. However, serious incidents
  are more frequent along EU external border zones.  3.  Identifying victims is problematic
  given the lack of formal screening procedures. Instead countries heavily rely on
  the expertise and knowledge of individual staff, although tools are increasingly
  being developed to facilitate identification by non-experts.   4.  Access to support
  is limited by the number of specialised medical staff who can provide psychological
  or psychiatric help. The lack of staff often leads to long waiting periods; for
  example, in Germany around 5,600 asylum seekers waited over a year to receive treatment.
  It is also a challenge starting therapy when asylum applicants are homeless or live
  in reception facilities that are not adequate to sustain the therapy.   5.  Despite
  training, monitoring bodies and complaints mechanisms in all member states, their
  effectiveness in preventing ill-treatment varies from country to country. Despite
  the lack of attention to torture and trauma victims, the report also identifies
  promising practices that other member states could adopt to identify and support
  victims. The European Commission asked the Agency for Fundamental Rights to collect
  data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in member states,
  particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 member
  states: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy,
  the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. '

text: "To be part of a world cup squad remains the pinnacle in any player\u2019s career,\
  \ but to miss the berth is an agonizing pain that not only hurts deep inside, but\
  \ keeps resurging for times to come. While most of our favorite stars are trying\
  \ to acclimatize with the punishing Down-Under demands, here is a look at the few\
  \ who would be forced to watch the games on television and mediate over missed chances.\
  \ Readers might not be in total agreement with my selection and would chip in alternatives,\
  \ but I have a strong belief that the players mentioned are still match winners\
  \ on their day. If given a chance they would sweat enough to fit in national shirts.1-\
  \ Alastair Cook2014 wasn't a year Cook would keep in his memory; the former England\
  \ skipper could only manage 523 runs in 20 matches at a mediocre average of 27.52.\
  \ To add salt to his wounds, back to back defeats against India and then Sri-Lanka\
  \ cut loose his arm band. This double jolt of form and luck convinced the selectors\
  \ to put faith in the young and charismatic Eoin Morgan.2-Kamran AkmalThe elder\
  \ Akmal is probably the most interesting player of his times. While most teams would\
  \ gladly offer him the opening slot, handing him the keeper\u2019s gloves needs\
  \ a lion\u2019s heart. He has been missing from ODI action since June 2013 but that\
  \ would be of little concern as he carries bundles of experience tasting Australian\
  \ pitches and modern pacers. Initially part of Pakistan\u2019s 30 member Squad,\
  \ Karman lost his place and popularity to the young and fearless Sarfaraz.3-Kevin\
  \ PietersenProbably the most dominating and explosive cricketer of the modern era,\
  \ the past year has been tough for the fire-eating stroke maker. A poor avg of 29.40\
  \ during the Ashes down under made the selector\u2019s job easy. For a high maintenance\
  \ player like him, even a few low scores are enough to raise questions. Last wearing\
  \ the England shirt in September 2013, KP has been creating havoc in cricket leagues\
  \ around the world and specially the Big Bash.4-Yuvraj SinghThe True \u201CRock-Star\u201D\
  \ of International cricket and a heartthrob to millions, 2015 Would Cup will surely\
  \ miss the beloved Yuvi. The Hero of the previous edition failed to appear in any\
  \ ODI in 2014 and had an average stint in IPL. The lowest point came when Yuvi failed\
  \ to cut into initial 30. Regardless of this rusty performance, Yuvi is one player\
  \ who\u2019s spark shines at the highest level, a ticking bomb that can go off exactly\
  \ when needed. Dhoni\u2019s 11 would definitely miss a match winner in their ranks.5-Fawad\
  \ AlamFawad Alam is undoubted Pakistan\u2019s hidden gem and at the same time, their\
  \ Unsolved puzzle. Forced into oblivion for a good 3 years, Fawad burst into match\
  \ winning performances when given a chance at the Asia Cup. His sparkling come back\
  \ was a huge surprise, big enough only to be matched by his omission from the world\
  \ cup. Milking 345 runs from 8 matches at a healthy avg of 43, Fawad suddenly became\
  \ the darling of the nation. His Vadera looking mustache and sticking-in approach\
  \ fetched back the much needed stability in the waggling middle order. In a batting\
  \ line up that\u2019s always ready to choke, one can only hope that Pakistan made\
  \ the right decision by leaving out their Iron-Wall.6-Dwayne BravoA maverick all\
  \ rounder, Bravo is missing the world cup seat for reasons purely beyond the boundary.\
  \ West Indian players have had a long prevailing payment dispute with their board\
  \ and Bravo; along with Kevin Pollard were the latest to feel the heat. Bravo faced\
  \ the music for leading the revolt and was replaced by former skipper Darren Sammy.7-Ryan\
  \ HarrisHave Australia made a blunder by not picking the blue chip Harris? Only\
  \ time will tell. Nicknamed Rhino for his hulking figure and tear-apart approach,\
  \ Harris makes a formidable opening bowling pair with Mitchell Johnson, one many\
  \ openers would least like to face. Despite some impressive performance, Australian\
  \ selectors\u2019 weren\u2019t convinced that the 35 year olds injury prone body\
  \ would survive the toil of the World Cup. They appeared more interested in handing\
  \ him the ball for the upcoming Ashes.8-James NeeshamNew Zealand stirred a storm\
  \ by dropping James Neesham and picking the long forgotten Gant Elliot. The magnitude\
  \ of this jolt could only be matched with Pakistan\u2019s dragging of Sohail Khan\
  \ from international oblivion. The debate against Nasham raised the fact that his\
  \ best performances came in test matches and his replacement Elliot would bring\
  \ solidity to the batting line.9-Ajantha MendisThe maestro that gave us the mystery\
  \ \u201CCarrom Ball\u201D and is remembered best for tormenting the Indian Team.\
  \ He might not be as effective as the time he emerged, but still remains a lethal\
  \ force in the shorter formats where batsmen don\u2019t have much time to adjust\
  \ to his variations. He is one of the 6 players overlooked by the Islanders for\
  \ the Cup. This cut could eventually mean an end to his illustrious but often up\
  \ and down career.10-Saeed AjmalThe story of Ajmal is the saddest of the Cup. Had\
  \ it not been for the suspected arm action, Ajmal would have been the Hercules for\
  \ Pakistan. Baffled with fitness issues, Ajmal\u2019s emission could stretch the\
  \ cup further away from the Green Shirts. Always a lethal force to reckon with,\
  \ Ajmal has been re-structuring his action ever since English umpire Ian Gould brought\
  \ his action under the microscope.11-Umer GulGul, undoubtedly Pakistan\u2019s most\
  \ experience bowler has been battling with a long aggravating knee injury. Operated\
  \ in May, Gul was recalled for the series against Sri-Lanka where the pain resurfaced\
  \ and turned chronic during the New Zealand series. Gul has maintained that he is\
  \ fit for the highest level, but somehow failed to satisfy the selectors. The architect\
  \ of the 2009 T-20 triumph and countless memorable moments, the world\u2019s best\
  \ dearth bowler will surely be missed.Robin Peterson \u2013 12th Man. It would be\

heading: Four questions on Iran's legal challenge to US sanctions
language: en
publisher: Geo News
summary: null
tags:
- world
text: 'Iran s legal challenge against renewed sanctions by the United States goes
  before the UN s International Court of Justice on Monday.  Here are four key questions
  regarding the case: What is the case about? Iran s attempt to block the reinstatement
  of sanctions, announced by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, is the latest
  in a series of court battles that Tehran and Washington are fighting at the ICJ.  Trump
  announced on May 8 that he was pulling out of a landmark deal between Iran and major
  powers aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The deal agreed
  with the UN s five permanent Security Council members and Germany in 2015 limits
  Tehran s stockpile of enriched uranium until 2031 in exchange for sanctions relief.
  Blasting the accord as a "horrible, one-sided deal", Trump reimposed a wave of tough,
  unilateral sanctions. Tehran now accuses Washington of "besieging" its economy and
  wants the Hague-based court   which rules in disputes between countries   to order
  the US to temporarily halt punitive measures, while the judges mull the deeper merits
  of the case. Does Tehran have a case? The case has two elements, said Eric De Brabandere,
  professor of international dispute settlement at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
  Firstly, "Iran genuinely considers the re-imposition of sanctions a violation of
  international law." Secondly, "Iran has the support of many European states on the
  question of sanctions, politically speaking," De Brabandere argued. Iran s representatives
  need to convince the ICJ that its 15 permanent judges indeed have the jurisdiction
  to hear the case. Tehran bases its arguments on a little-known 1955 treaty between
  Iran and the United States. The treaty provides for "friendly relations" between
  the two countries, encourages mutual trade and investment and regulates consular
  relations. However, there have been no formal diplomatic ties between Tehran and
  Washington since the regime of the US-backed Shah was deposed by Iran''s revolution
  in 1979. What will Washington argue? "My guess is that for this case they will argue
  that the court has no jurisdiction, as they did in a separate case launched against
  the US two years ago," said De Brabandere. Washington could invoke two arguments.
  One is that the 1955 treaty is no longer in force, because it is a "treaty of friendship"
  between two nations which have been adversaries for the last four decades. Secondly,
  US representatives could say that the dispute was "not about the treaty, but about
  sanctions and Iran s alleged terrorist activities," De Brabandere said. "The US
  is likely to argue that the dispute is about something much broader than a treaty,"
  for instance Tehran s nuclear ambitions, the expert said. Furthermore, there is
  a clause in the 1955 treaty which allows the states to take "any measures to protect
  essential security interests." Can Iran s case succeed? "I think it s very likely
  that the ICJ will, based on the 1955 treaty, decide to hear the case," said De Brabandere.
  However, whether the case will be successful on its own merits -- in other words
  whether the United States indeed breached its obligations -- is more difficult to
  establish. "For one, the 1955 treaty is relatively narrow in scope. It means that
  the ICJ can only rule whether the US violated its obligations under the specific
  treaty," De Brabandere said. This means that the ICJ s judges will not rule in what
  they may consider any broader dispute between Iran and the United States. The outcome
  of the case   which could still take years before being handed down   "is very difficult
  to predict," said De Brabandere. '

text: 'THE HAGUE: Iran will argue Monday against renewed sanctions imposed by the
  United States, as a bitter legal battle between Tehran and Washington opens before
  the UN s top court. US President Donald Trump reimposed a wave of tough unilateral
  sanctions on Iran three weeks ago, bringing back into effect harsh penalties that
  had been lifted under a landmark 2015 agreement. A second round of measures is to
  come into effect in early November, targeting Iran s valuable oil and energy sector.
  Tehran filed its case before the International Court of Justice in late July, calling
  on the Hague-based tribunal s judges to order the immediate lifting of sanctions,
  which it said would cause "irreparable prejudice." The US had no right to reinstate
  such measures, Tehran added, as it demanded compensation for damages. Iran maintained
  restoring the penalties lifted under the historic 2015 deal, aimed at curbing Tehran
  s nuclear ambitions, violated a decades-old treaty signed between the two nations
  in 1955. The ICJ -- set up in 1946 to rule in disputes between countries -- is expected
  to take a couple of months to decide whether to grant Tehran s request for a provisional
  ruling, while a final decision in the case may actually still take years. Trump
  described the 2015 deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the United
  Nations Security Council, as well as Germany, as a "horrible one-sided deal (that)
  failed to achieve the fundamental objective of blocking all paths to a Iranian nuclear
  bomb." Even though all of the other parties pleaded with him not to abandon the
  pact, Trump pulled out and announced he would reinstate sanctions.  Neither war,
  nor negotiations  Tehran -- which argues that the move violates the little-known
  1955 Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations -- says that the new sanctions are already
  hurting its economy. Iran s currency the rial has lost around half its value since
  April. A raft of international companies -- including France s Total, Peugeot and
  Renault, and Germany s Siemens and Daimler -- have suspended operations in Iran
  in the wake of the move. Both Air France and British Airways announced Thursday
  they were halt flights to Tehran next month, saying they were not commercially viable,
  but the British carrier added the decision was unrelated to the new tranche of sanctions.
  In his executive order, Trump argued that the sanctions would turn up the financial
  pressure on Tehran to come to a "comprehensive and lasting solution" regarding activities
  that the international community regarded as "malign" such as Iran s "ballistic
  missile programme and its support for terrorism." Earlier this month, Iran s supreme
  leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to rule out any immediate prospect of talks,
  saying "there will be neither war, nor negotiations," with the US. Washington s
  lawyers will present their case on Tuesday, with experts believing they are to challenge
  the ICJ s jurisdiction. '

text: 'Nearly half the world s schools lack clean drinking water, toilets and handwashing
  facilities, putting millions of children at risk of disease, experts warned on Monday.
  Almost 900 million children have to contend with a lack of basic hygiene facilities
  during their education, putting their health at risk and meaning some have to miss
  school.  You can t have a quality learning environment without these basics,  said
  Dr Rick Johnston of the World Health Organization, a lead researcher on the project.  Children
  may not come to school at all if there s no toilets ... Then, when they are at school,
  they are not going to at their very best if they not able to use a decent toilet
  or if they are not properly hydrated.  World leaders have signed up to global pledges
  to provide safe water and hygiene facilities for all and ensure every child gets
  a comprehensive education by 2030 under the UN s sustainable development goals.
  A lack of safe water and sanitation facilities can cause dehydration, illness, and
  even death. But many children are forced to risk their health to take part in classes,
  according to the report produced jointly by the United Nations Children s Fund UNICEF
  and the WHO, the first to look specifically at provision in schools. It found nearly
  a third of primary and secondary schools lacked a safe and reliable drinking water
  supply, affecting nearly 570 million children. Nearly 20 per cent of schools had
  no safe drinking water at all. Just over a third of schools lacked adequate toilet
  facilities, affecting more than 620 million children. Almost one in five primary
  schools and one in eight secondary schools were considered to have no sanitation.
  Nearly half lacked proper handwashing facilities, essential for helping prevent
  the spread of infections and disease. Nearly 900 million children were affected,
  the report found. Sub-Saharan Africa, East and Southeast Asia had some of the worst
  facilities.  It s deeply shocking,  Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of charity
  WaterAid, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The consequences are very broad
  in terms of children s access to education, general health and state of nutrition.  Adolescent
  girls in particular are often forced to miss classes when they are on their periods
  if there are no proper cleaning and sanitation facilities, he said. More than a
  third of girls in South Asia miss school during their periods, often because they
  lack access to toilets or pads, according to a WaterAid and UNICEF study earlier
  this year. The World Bank last year warned countries needed to quadruple spending
  to $150 billion a year to deliver universal safe water and sanitation. However,
  experts say they are optimistic the situation can be quickly improved if leaders
  treat water, sanitation and hygiene as a priority.  With political will, it really
  is possible to deliver good quality services,  said Johnston. '

  \ coach Vince Lombardi had famously said, \u201CWinning isn\u2019t everything, it\u2019\

  \ put both hands on the trophy, but also add shine to it.But then there are the\
  \ few who worked their hearts out, but somehow success and luck refused to favour\
  \ them. Here is a look at World Cups 5 captivating individual performances that\
  \ failed to win games.1-Martin Crowe, New Zealand 1992Semi-Final against Pakistan,\
  \ 83 ball 91 runsThe 1992 Cup was a time to restructure the game. Cricket was coming\
  \ to innovative Australasia and the Kerry Packer touch was impacting to revolutionize\
  \ the game on big stage. The traditional red ball and white screens were replaced\
  \ with white and black respectively. Multicolored kits and games under flood lights\
  \ gave cricket and viewers a fresh experience.Led by the maverick Martin Crowe,\
  \ NZ were the team to beat in 92. Crowe was enjoying the form of his life leading\
  \ his team to the semis with 7 straight wins against one defeat. With all his weapons\
  \ and tactics syncing together, Crowe was eyeing to be part of Kiwi folklore. Coming\
  \ in to bat at 39/2, Crowe dominated the spirited Pakistani attack and with 7 fours\
  \ and 3 sixes set Eden Park on fire. Lifting the total to a nerve soothing 262,\
  \ Martin had changed into shorts and was already planning strategies for the final.But\
  \ sadly, few things didn\u2019t go his way, the weather report that had forecasted\
  \ huge downpour resisted till the last ball, while batting he pulled a hamstring,\
  \ his decision not to take the field and letting his deputy John Wright take charge\
  \ and finally little known BIG-INZI hitting a match winning 37 ball 60. His was\
  \ the World Cup\u2019s sparkling performance that fell to some ill-planning, thus\
  \ ending in a national heartbreak.2- Javagal Srinath, India 1996Semi-Final against\
  \ Sri Lanka, 3 for 34Don\u2019t be puzzled by Jaggu Dadas figures, for those who\
  \ knew the mindset and lethality of the Sri Lankan batting line of those days, it\
  \ was equivalent of walking barefooted on burning charcoals. Under Dav Whatmore,\
  \ the Lankans had set a new meaning for early over slogs. Where 60 in first 15 were\
  \ considered a healthy score, Little Romesh Kaluwitharana and Sanath Jayasuriya\
  \ made a mockery of bowling lines by smashing 100\u2019s off 10\u2019s.With this\
  \ slaughtering attitude, Sri Lankans came to face India at Eden Garden, the cricketing\
  \ Heart of the nation. To win their nations heart, Azharuddin\u2019s men had to\
  \ put a courageous display. The Mysore Express did exactly that when he penned the\
  \ unthinkable script, removing both openers in the first over with just ONE run\
  \ on the board. For the 90 thousand plus fanatic Indian fans, it was enough to lay\
  \ their hearts on Srinaths feet.The Mysore Express then puffed more steam to remove\
  \ Asanka Gurusinha, Sri Lanka were bleeding 3 for 35. The dream of a billion was\
  \ about to see light but Aravinda De Silvas fighting fifty and a dramatic Indian\
  \ batting collapse shattered that dream. The riots that followed would be remembered\
  \ as the most humiliating day in Indian Cricket.3- Lance Klusener - The Choke of\
  \ the Century1999 Semi-final against Australia, 16 ball 31 runsBy 1999 the Proteas\
  \ were the leading force in World cricket and arguably the most lethal unit in the\
  \ Cup. They were creating havocs in opponent ranks thanks to one of the most swashbuckling\
  \ hitters of all time. Lance Klusener had the natural ability to tear apart even\
  \ the most balanced and orchestrated bowling attack.The man they call Zulu was in\
  \ magical form, scoring 250 in 8 innings and also pocketing 17 important wickets.\
  \ But his fairytale run had to come to a sorry end, in the most dramatic fashion,\
  \ against the most worthy opponents, in one of the most thrilling matches ever contested.In\
  \ a fluctuating match that never seemed to have a clear winner, Klusener walked\
  \ in with South Africa needing 39 runs in 5 over\u2019s, Steve Waugh\u2019s men\
  \ were smelling victory, but to tease their nostrils Zulu was the last man standing.What\
  \ seemed like a daunting task, Klusener make it look like a walk in the park. With\
  \ 9 required from the last over, the hero of 96 semis Damien Fleming was trusted\
  \ to deliver once again. Klusener on the other hand showed no respect and hammered\
  \ the first 2 balls for consecutive boundaries. With the scores level only one was\
  \ required off 4 balls. That\u2019s where the panic happened and the term \u201C\
  Chokers\u201D gained substance. Klusener pushed the ball to mid-off for the winning\
  \ run, but he and his partner Allan Donald blundered with the basic principle of\
  \ running between the wickets. Australia moved to the finals while Klusener would\
  \ be remembered for this infamous comic, tragic and chock run out. 4- Wahab Riaz\
  \ \u2013 Viki\u2019s biggest yet saddest day2011 Semi-final against India, 5 for\
  \ 4630th March was a big day for 2011 World Cup, yet it turned out to be a day Wahab\
  \ Riaz would remember for his topsy turvy fortunes. Called in to replace knee nursing\
  \ Shoaib Akhtar, the lively Mohali pitch was ready for Wahab to bang in hard. Having\
  \ spent three sleepless nights cooking his strategy against Dhoni\u2019s men, both\
  \ Wahab and his luck were itching to shine.While the more experienced Umar Gul received\
  \ hammering, Wahab dried runs and kept picking big names. The highlight was dismissing\
  \ India\u2019s darling Yuvi on the first ball full toss, a ball enough to make Shoaib\
  \ himself jump in the dressing room. Wahab would then ignition the airplane celebration,\
  \ a trade mark registered by Shoaib himself. Wahab\u2019s first 5 wicket haul would\
  \ restrict India to a challenging 260 to defend, a job only to be made easy by yet\
  \ another Pakistani batting collapse.5- Mahela Jayawardene \u2013 The Big Match\
  \ Performer2011 World Cup final against India, 88 ball 103Mahela Jayawardene's high-classic\
  \ 100 at Wankhede did not deserve to be the only one of six in World Cup finals\
  \ to not have been good enough to earn the maker's side the trophy. Majestic Mahela\
  \ had played the 2007 final as a captain and this time he was Sangakkara\u2019s\
  \ main hope.Coming in at 2 for 60, The Islanders needed a partnership going to get\
  \ the cup. It was time for Mahela to bring out his years of experience and construct\
  \ an empire brick by brick. In-font of an incredibly hostile Mumbaians, his signature\
  \ strokes not only imposed a graveyard silence but reverted the pressure right back\
  \ on the Indian bowlers.Like a true spirited fighter, he helped build up a healthy\
  \ 62 runs partnership with Sanga and made sure he survived the full 50 over\u2019\

  the suspended players, Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif, admitted in their official

  Mushahidullah, said Islamabad United players Sharjeel Khan, Khalid Latif and Mohammad
  Irfan met the bookie named Yousuf during the Pakistan Super League but did not inform
  the PCB s Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU). According to Shahryar Khan, the evidence gathered
  by the ACU shows that Sharjeel followed through on his agreement with the bookie
  in Islamabad United s opening match in PSL. Latif was willing to do the same but
  he did not play that match. Mohammad Irfan, however, did not pay attention to the
  bookie s instructions but he still did not notify the board, due to which the pacer
  is still under investigation, Khan elaborated. Nasir Jamshed arranged meeting with
  bookie The PCB chairman informed the committee that bookies do not approach players
  directly. They either make contacts with the players  relatives or former players
  who can get them in touch with their intended targets.  The bookie Yousuf met Nasir
  Jamshed, and both of them came to Dubai from London. Nasir Jamshed said to the players
  that a man wants to meet them, and arranged meeting of Sharjeel, Latif and Irfan
  with the bookie,  Khan explained. The PCB s ACU, however, was alert throughout and
  knew such an incident could happen, which is why such swift action was taken against
  the players, the chairman added.  Match fixing is universal. Bookies come to wherever
  T20 matches are played. They also come to India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The first
  edition of PSL was successful, hence the bookies came to the second edition of the
  league,  Khan noted.   '

  Mustehsan, seems to be all in favour of women empowerment. The Coke Studio singer
  is of the opinion that there should be a separate PSL held for female cricketers.
  The Islamabad United ambassador was speaking to Geo.TV, where she was asked if there
  should be a PSL for women cricketers to go along with the theme of women empowerment.
  Momina said that it s an important theme that should be highlighted. Giving an example
  of her team s fellow female ambassadors, who happen to be female cricketers too,
  the singer said that the sport should be promoted at the same level for both genders.
  Girls should also excel in this field, she said. When asked that if other teams
  should also take a leaf out of Islamabad United s book as far as the addition of
  female cricket ambassadors goes, Momina said that not only franchises, the entire
  nation should be promoting this initiative.  We need to set a precedent so we get
  more Bismas and Javerias,  she said while referring to fellow team ambassadors and
  female cricketers. Equality should be for everyone and everywhere, said the Coke
  Studio singer. When the subject turned to the national anthem of Islamabad United  Cricket
  Joray Pakistan  Mustehsan was asked about the concept behind the song. The song
  is about bringing the nation together as a lot of Pakistanis are here to watch the
  sport, no matter what team they support, cricket unifies them in the end, she commented.  Cricket
  always does bring us together,  she added. At the end of the interview, when asked
  to chant a few lines from the song she sang for her team, Momina politely declined.   '

text: 'ISLAMABAD: Members of opposition parties lambasted the Pakistan Peoples Party
  on Monday for their failure to nominate a joint candidate for the upcoming presidential
  election.  The grand alliance of opposition parties had initially resolved to field
  a joint candidate for the country s presidency. The PPP, however, stuck to Aitzaz
  Ahsan as its choice for the presidential nomination despite the Pakistan Muslim
  League-Nawaz s objections. The rest of the opposition eventually fielded Maulana
  Fazlur Rahman for the slot earlier today. Dr Arif Alvi is the presidential candidate
  nominated by the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Addressing a joint press
  conference, PML-N leader and former interior minister Ahsan Iqbal criticised the
  PPP for failing to end the deadlock and expressed hope that the party will review
  its decision and prevent the opposition s vote from splitting.  Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal
  (MMA) leader Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri thanked the opposition alliance for nominating
  Maulana Fazl for the post, while regretting the PPP s lack of support to the opposition
  s cause.  Haideri further said that as per the opposition s calculations, Fazl looked
  in a position to win the presidential polls.  Arif Alvi, Aitzaz Ahsan and Maulana
  Fazl submit nomination papers for presidency  Opposition parties except PPP decided
  to field the JUI-F chief for the post of the country''s president Terming the PPP
  s decision as  shocking , National Party leader Hasil Khan Bizenjo lamented the
  failure of the grand alliance to put up a strong front on the matter.   The way
  PPP backed out was shocking,  he said.  All the parties had asked PPP to propose
  another name.  It was not possible for PML-N to vote for Aitzaz Ahsan, Bizenjo added.  The
  deadline for candidates to submit their nomination papers for the upcoming presidential
  election ended at noon today. Polling for the presidential election will be held
  on September 4.  '

  tomorrow to hold talks over the matter. The Pakistani delegation is headed by Pakistan
  Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Meher Ali Shah.  Following meetings between the
  two parties, a joint notification would be issued.  The projects by India have been
  started on Chenab River, which violate the Indus Waters Treaty signed between the
  two countries, sources said.  Officials have confirmed that India wanted to place
  spillway of 1,000 megawatts of Pakal Dul Dam on Chenab River in Indian-occupied
  Kashmir, about 15 metres down against the permissible limit, which will give the
  country undue leverage of holding 11,000 acres of feet water in addition to allowed
  volume of water storage, The News reported.  India wanted to establish water storage
  capacity of 88,000 acre feet on Chenab River with the setting up of Pakal Dul Dam.
  Pakal Dul Dam is a reservoir-based scheme currently under construction on river
  Marusudar, the main right bank tributary of Chenab River in Kishtwar tehsil of Doda
  district in Jammu and Kashmir, while lower Kalnai project is of 48 megawatts on

  prison on Saturday, she announced in a note posted on her husband s Facebook page.
  Sotoudeh said she was launching her protest over the recent arrest of a prominent
  civil rights activist and the harassment of his, and her own, family by security
  forces. Sotoudeh served about half of a six-year jail sentence imposed in 2010 for
  spreading propaganda and conspiring to harm state security   charges she denied   before
  being freed in 2013. She was arrested again in June and her husband, Reza Khandan,
  told Iranian media she is facing security charges. "Since none of my correspondence
  with the authorities has produced a result, I have no choice but to start a hunger
  strike as of [August 25, 2018] in protest against the judicial arrests and pressure
  against my family, relatives and friends," Sotoudeh wrote on Khandan s Facebook
  page. She added the words: "With the hope of the establishment of law and justice
  in our dear country Iran." Sotoudeh, who has represented Iranian opposition activists,
  embarked on an earlier 50-day hunger strike in 2012 against a travel ban on her
  daughter. Her case then caused an international outcry in which the United States
  and the human rights group Amnesty International criticised Iran and she was freed
  in September 2013 ahead of a visit to the United Nations by President Hassan Rouhani,
  soon after he was swept into office in part on promises of liberal reforms. Sotoudeh

heading: Investors to get their say after Musk scuttles Tesla buyout
language: en
publisher: Geo News
summary: null

text: 'Investors on Monday will render their verdict on Tesla Chief Executive Elon
  Musk s decision to abandon a proposed $72 billion buyout to take the luxury electric
  car maker private.  Musk said in a blog post late on Friday that his decision to
  scuttle the proposed deal was motivated in part by existing Tesla shareholders who
  said they wanted the company to remain publicly-traded. The trading on Monday will
  be a test of how investors are taking the demise of the buyout plan, and their views
  on whether Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, can avoid going back to capital
  markets to raise more cash. Tesla s shares already had fallen nearly 10 percent
  below their level on Aug. 7, just before Musk tweeted that he had  funding secured  for
  a buyout at $420 a share. Investors in Tesla s bonds and convertible debt also had
  shown skepticism that the buyout would materialize during the days after that tweet,
  and a subsequent blog post in which Musk made a case for going private. With Musk
  s idea of a buyout backed by Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund off the table,
  investors will focus on Tesla s efforts to become profitable, the company s cash
  reserves and what steps Musk could take to raise fresh capital. Musk and Tesla also
  face a series of investor lawsuits and a US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation
  into the factual accuracy of Musk s tweet that funding for the buyout deal was  secured.  Tesla
  had $2.78 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, after a record $718
  million loss. In early August, before the buyout plan was made public, Tesla reiterated
  a forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, under
  normal accounting rules, and Musk said the company would not need to raise more
  cash. A Tesla spokesman on Sunday referred to those previous comments. One of Tesla
  s biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3,
  which is critical to its profitability goals. Tapping capital markets Analysts have
  suggested a capital raise may be required soon to boost investor confidence. Musk
  and Tesla could hold off on any fundraising plans for the time being, in part tapping
  capital markets would contradict Musk s comments about Tesla being adequately funded,
  investment bankers who are not working for the company said over the weekend. This
  week would also be an inopportune time for a capital raising, given that many bankers
  and investors are away ahead of the Sept. 3 Labour Day holiday.  The high price
  investors have put on Tesla s shares has allowed Musk to expand US production, invest
  in building out a vehicle charging network and start work on new models including
  a small sport utility vehicle, a new Roadster and a semi-truck even as the company
  burned cash. Tesla earlier this year announced plans to build a battery and vehicle
  assembly complex in China. Musk said earlier this month the company s  default plan  would
  be to fund that expansion by borrowing money from Chinese banks. '

  Irfan met the bookie named Yousuf during the Pakistan Super League but did not inform
  the PCB s Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU). According to Shahryar Khan, the evidence gathered
  by the ACU shows that Sharjeel followed through on his agreement with the bookie
  in Islamabad United s opening match in PSL. Latif was willing to do the same but
  he did not play that match. Mohammad Irfan, however, did not pay attention to the
  bookie s instructions but he still did not notify the board, due to which the pacer
  is still under investigation, Khan elaborated. Nasir Jamshed arranged meeting with
  bookie The PCB chairman informed the committee that bookies do not approach players
  directly. They either make contacts with the players  relatives or former players
  who can get them in touch with their intended targets.  The bookie Yousuf met Nasir
  Jamshed, and both of them came to Dubai from London. Nasir Jamshed said to the players
  that a man wants to meet them, and arranged meeting of Sharjeel, Latif and Irfan
  with the bookie,  Khan explained. The PCB s ACU, however, was alert throughout and
  knew such an incident could happen, which is why such swift action was taken against
  the players, the chairman added.  Match fixing is universal. Bookies come to wherever
  T20 matches are played. They also come to India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The first
  edition of PSL was successful, hence the bookies came to the second edition of the

  \ as we discuss that fateful day of March 17, 2007. Painfully remembered as the\
  \ darkest day in Pakistan Cricket, it was the same day that brought down the curtains\
  \ on Azhar\u2019s otherwise celebrated career.Ironically, it was Azhar\u2019s slower\
  \ ball that was picked early by Irish skipper Trent Johnston and he hit the ball\
  \ high and handsome to foster some of the craziest celebrations in Irish Cricket\
  \ history.No wonder, this is one game Azhar never feels comfortable discussing.Meanwhile,\
  \ Mohammad Yousuf is quick to point out the grudge ICC had towards Pakistan as they\
  \ did their part in assisting Ireland, \u201CGreen top wicket was deliberately prepared\
  \ for our match\u201D.He was also cynical about the media trial that followed, \u201C\
  We can\u2019t forget how media bashed us after that match, India lost to Bangladesh\
  \ in the same World Cup but their media didn't give them the same treatment\u201D\
  .Background2007 was probably the darkest year in Pakistan cricket. To start off\
  \ with, they never had the ideal preparations walking into the Mega Event. A 3-1\
  \ drubbing against the Protease on their home ground did little to boost their confidence.\
  \ That defeat was followed by another scratchy performance against the West-Indies\
  \ in the tournament opener where Lara\u2019s men handed them a 54 run defeat.On\
  \ the other side, a splendid century by Jeremy Bray helped Ireland fight out a thrilling\
  \ tie against the much experienced Zimbabweans. Don\u2019t forget, this was their\
  \ first ever World Cup.From there on, the stage was set for the Irish to step up\
  \ and lock arms with the big boys. Their next obstruction was the Sub-continent\
  \ giants, Pakistan. With a reputation of always being ready for self destruction,\
  \ they were just the kind of opponents the Irish needed to engineer the greatest\
  \ upset in modern cricket. Iceberg, right ahead!!!This was not going to be Pakistan\u2019\
  s day, and that was evident with the first proceeding of the day when Johnston called\
  \ correctly at the toss and sent Pakistan to bat on a grass top wicket.It was also\
  \ the Irish National holiday known as St. Patrick's Day and somehow the grass on\
  \ the pitch matched the Irish shade of green, perhaps setting the right ingredients\
  \ for a National Feast later in the day.Years later, Irish Off spinner Kyle McCallan\
  \ admitted he was shocked to see the green top wicket,\u201CThe pitch was absolutely\
  \ green and that played into our hands as Irish players are used to such pitches\
  \ whereas there are not many such wickets in Pakistan, so when Johnston won the\
  \ Toss we could see an opportunity to exploit\u201D. The Pakistani camp knew it\
  \ was not going to be an easy outing either. Their coach; the Late Bob Woolmer described\
  \ the game as a \u201CSerious banana skin fixture\u201D.The Irish had done their\
  \ homework; it took Langford- Smith just six balls to find flaws in Hafiz\u2019\
  s technique when he made him edge an away swinger to the keeper.That top order jolt\
  \ was too much for the incoming batsmen and they kept leaving the field in haste,\
  \ as if hot chicken biryani was being served in the dressing room.Such was the accuracy\
  \ in the Irish bowling and juice in the wicket that seven Pakistani batsmen failed\
  \ to reach double figures. Imran Nazir did little to stabilise things with 24 while\
  \ Kamran Akmal resisted with a hard fought 27 to stretch the score to a miserable\
  \ 132.That done, Ireland had done half the job, but their smiles were cautious as\
  \ they knew a treacherous ride awaited them ahead.Captain Inspirational 132 was\
  \ a small total, but suddenly started to look huge for the newcomers, it was their\
  \ first such situation and no surprises that nervousness started trickling in. The\
  \ innings break was a tricky time and someone needed to spark their self belief.\
  \ It was time for Trent Johnston to give the Irish version of the Cornered Tigers\
  \ speech, \u201CGuys, we have a massive chance to make it to the super 8, you have\
  \ a chance to stay in the West-Indies for another four weeks. I promise you it\u2019\

  \ everything, because if we lost, our WC was over, and the only way to do that was\
  \ to take early wickets\u201D, recalls Azhar Mehmood.And strike well they did with\
  \ M. Sami generating lightening pace to get rid of Jeremy Bray and the current English\
  \ Captain Eoin Morgan as Irish were licking their wounds at 15 for 2.Ireland needed\
  \ a hero to steady their ship and Niall O\u2019Brian decided to place himself in\
  \ the modern Irish folklore. In the tense chase his hard fought 72 took the game\
  \ out of Pakistan\u2019s hands.Shoaib Malik did eventually get rid of him but the\
  \ damage had been done. Rao Iftikhar then struck twice in quick succession to put\
  \ the Irish fans in doubt, but Kevin O Brian and ultimately Skipper Johnston made\
  \ sure the fairly-tale ride doesn\u2019t come to an abrupt end.Things get uglier\
  \ for PakistanIreland became the story of the Cup; they went out to beat Bangladesh,\
  \ proving to the world that the win against Pakistan was not just a fluke.For Pakistan,\

  \ mafia fearing he might spill beans for them, the official word cited natural causes.However,\
  \ his death is shrouded in mystery till today. Pakistan were forced out of the Cup\

  \ were a better team on that day, they played well and read the conditions. We fought\

  .That was eight years ago, on Sunday things would be favoring Pakistan as the wicket\

  Musk s decision to abandon a proposed $72 billion buyout to take the luxury electric
  car maker private.  Musk said in a blog post late on Friday that his decision to
  scuttle the proposed deal was motivated in part by existing Tesla shareholders who
  said they wanted the company to remain publicly-traded. The trading on Monday will
  be a test of how investors are taking the demise of the buyout plan, and their views
  on whether Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, can avoid going back to capital
  markets to raise more cash. Tesla s shares already had fallen nearly 10 percent
  below their level on Aug. 7, just before Musk tweeted that he had  funding secured  for
  a buyout at $420 a share. Investors in Tesla s bonds and convertible debt also had
  shown skepticism that the buyout would materialize during the days after that tweet,
  and a subsequent blog post in which Musk made a case for going private. With Musk
  s idea of a buyout backed by Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund off the table,
  investors will focus on Tesla s efforts to become profitable, the company s cash
  reserves and what steps Musk could take to raise fresh capital. Musk and Tesla also
  face a series of investor lawsuits and a US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation
  into the factual accuracy of Musk s tweet that funding for the buyout deal was  secured.  Tesla
  had $2.78 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, after a record $718
  million loss. In early August, before the buyout plan was made public, Tesla reiterated
  a forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, under
  normal accounting rules, and Musk said the company would not need to raise more
  cash. A Tesla spokesman on Sunday referred to those previous comments. One of Tesla
  s biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3,
  which is critical to its profitability goals. Tapping capital markets Analysts have
  suggested a capital raise may be required soon to boost investor confidence. Musk
  and Tesla could hold off on any fundraising plans for the time being, in part tapping
  capital markets would contradict Musk s comments about Tesla being adequately funded,
  investment bankers who are not working for the company said over the weekend. This
  week would also be an inopportune time for a capital raising, given that many bankers

  \ security forces\u201D, said a counter terrorism official while commenting on the\
  \ killing of Saifullah Kurd on Sunday in Quetta.Mohammad Usman alias Saifullah Kurd\
  \ was chief of the banned LeJ\u2019s Balochistan chapter and was the most wanted\
  \ terrorist in the province. The provincial government had announced a reward or\
  \ \u2018head money\u2019 of Rs. 2.5 million. Speaking to Geo News the Quetta Police\
  \ Chief Abdul Razzaq Cheema confirmed his death. A top security source disclosed\
  \ that, Kurd\u2019s aide was also neutralized during the operation. \u201CAn identity\
  \ card was recovered from his pocket bearing the name Ghulam Sarwar, but his identity\
  \ is yet to be confirmed\u201D told the source. On an intelligence tip-off, a special\
  \ unit of the Frontier Corps Balochistan raided a hotel in Shaal Kot, Karachi Road\
  \ area of Saryab. In the exchange of fire that followed between terrorists and the\
  \ law enforcers Saifullah Kurd was gunned down along with his accomplice. One law\
  \ enforcer embraced martyrdom while 4 others were injured. Weapons and mobile phones\
  \ were also recovered from Kurd\u2019s possession. Intelligence sources revealed,\
  \ that Kurd was a known terrorist and the mastermind of all major sectarian attacks\
  \ in Balochistan specially in the provincial capital, Quetta. \u201CWhether it was\
  \ an assault on busses carrying pilgrims or the genocide of hundreds of Shia Hazara\
  \ in the Alamdar Road and Hazara Town blasts; being a planner he had become a symbol\
  \ of the reign of terror in the province\u201D, the intelligence source revealed.\
  \ Kurd was apprehended once before, but managed to escape from a high security prison.\
  \ He was apprehended by an intelligence agency along with the Sindh CID in December\
  \ 2005 from Cattle colony in Karachi. After his arrest from the metropolis, he was\
  \ shifted to Quetta where he was kept at the Anti Terrorist Force\u2019s high security\
  \ prison inside Quetta Cantonment. Astonishingly in 2008, he escaped from the fortified\
  \ prison and remained at large till Sunday, when he was killed.According to his\
  \ interrogation report, seen by this scribe, Kurd was one of 8 siblings born to\
  \ Noor Mohammad who hailed from a poor background. At the young age of 15, he began\
  \ driving an oil tanker and later joined Dawood Badini another oil tanker driver.\
  \ Badini\u2019s father was Mulana Ameer Hamza Badini, the leader of the proscribed\
  \ Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan \u2013 renamed as Ahle Sunnat Wal Jammat (ASWJ). Badini\
  \ is the nephew of al-Qaeda\u2019s former operational commander and No. 3, Khalid\
  \ Sheikh Mohammad. He is also the brother-in-law of Ramzi Yousaf, who executed the\
  \ first terror attack in the United States in 1993 at the World Trade Center in\
  \ New York. Saifullah Kurd began visiting gatherings hosted by Badini\u2019s father,\
  \ Ameer Hamza and under his influence joined the proscribed Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan.\
  \ In 1998, Saifullah Kurd first met with Riaz Basra, the founder of banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi\
  \ in Kabul, Afghanistan. A recently executed terrorist Shabbir aka Doctor was also\
  \ present during the meeting. It was in Afghanistan that Kurd received 20-days of\
  \ training at the Khalid Bin Waleed training camp run by banned Harkat-ul-Mujahideen,\
  \ where he was trained on how to use pistols and AK-47 assault rifles by his trainer,\
  \ Ustad Usama.Kurd stayed in Afghanistan for a month and returned to Quetta via\
  \ Kabul, Khandhar and Chaman. He carried out his first sectarian assault in October\
  \ 6, 1999 on Zarghoon Road in Quetta. Along with two aides, Saifullah ambushed the\
  \ vehicle of the then head of the Hazara tribe and provincial minister for education,\
  \ Sardar Nisar Hazara. The minister and his bodyguard were injured while his driver\
  \ lost his life in the attack. For their direct involvement in terrorist attacks,\
  \ both Kurd and Badini were sentenced to death by an Anti-Terrorist Court in Quetta\
  \ back in 2003. Saifullah Kurd was considered the closest and trust worthy lieutenant\

  have been stranded due to administration negligence. All of these students come
  from distant cities and areas in the province, while some hail from outside Punjab.
  Geo News has learnt that police had given a notice to hostel administration a week
  ago. They said that they had repeatedly asked the administration to improve security,
  before finally getting the hostels vacated tonight upon non-compliance of orders
  by admin staff. Reached for comment, hostel administration declined the request.
  Police said the hostels will not be reopened until adequate security arrangements
  are made. The situation also perplexed the parents of the students, who questioned
  where would their children go at this hour of night. The students, outside the hostels,
  were found calling their relatives and friends in Lahore in search of a temporary
  place to stay at. No institute asked to get hostels vacated: DIG On the other hand,
  DIG Operations Lahore Haider Ashraf denied that the police asked NCA administration

  \ put both hands on the trophy, but also add shine to it.But then there are the\
  \ few who worked their hearts out, but somehow success and luck refused to favour\
  \ them. Here is a look at World Cups 5 captivating individual performances that\
  \ failed to win games.1-Martin Crowe, New Zealand 1992Semi-Final against Pakistan,\
  \ 83 ball 91 runsThe 1992 Cup was a time to restructure the game. Cricket was coming\
  \ to innovative Australasia and the Kerry Packer touch was impacting to revolutionize\
  \ the game on big stage. The traditional red ball and white screens were replaced\
  \ with white and black respectively. Multicolored kits and games under flood lights\
  \ gave cricket and viewers a fresh experience.Led by the maverick Martin Crowe,\
  \ NZ were the team to beat in 92. Crowe was enjoying the form of his life leading\
  \ his team to the semis with 7 straight wins against one defeat. With all his weapons\
  \ and tactics syncing together, Crowe was eyeing to be part of Kiwi folklore. Coming\
  \ in to bat at 39/2, Crowe dominated the spirited Pakistani attack and with 7 fours\
  \ and 3 sixes set Eden Park on fire. Lifting the total to a nerve soothing 262,\
  \ Martin had changed into shorts and was already planning strategies for the final.But\
  \ sadly, few things didn\u2019t go his way, the weather report that had forecasted\
  \ huge downpour resisted till the last ball, while batting he pulled a hamstring,\
  \ his decision not to take the field and letting his deputy John Wright take charge\
  \ and finally little known BIG-INZI hitting a match winning 37 ball 60. His was\
  \ the World Cup\u2019s sparkling performance that fell to some ill-planning, thus\
  \ ending in a national heartbreak.2- Javagal Srinath, India 1996Semi-Final against\
  \ Sri Lanka, 3 for 34Don\u2019t be puzzled by Jaggu Dadas figures, for those who\
  \ knew the mindset and lethality of the Sri Lankan batting line of those days, it\
  \ was equivalent of walking barefooted on burning charcoals. Under Dav Whatmore,\
  \ the Lankans had set a new meaning for early over slogs. Where 60 in first 15 were\
  \ considered a healthy score, Little Romesh Kaluwitharana and Sanath Jayasuriya\
  \ made a mockery of bowling lines by smashing 100\u2019s off 10\u2019s.With this\
  \ slaughtering attitude, Sri Lankans came to face India at Eden Garden, the cricketing\
  \ Heart of the nation. To win their nations heart, Azharuddin\u2019s men had to\
  \ put a courageous display. The Mysore Express did exactly that when he penned the\
  \ unthinkable script, removing both openers in the first over with just ONE run\
  \ on the board. For the 90 thousand plus fanatic Indian fans, it was enough to lay\
  \ their hearts on Srinaths feet.The Mysore Express then puffed more steam to remove\
  \ Asanka Gurusinha, Sri Lanka were bleeding 3 for 35. The dream of a billion was\
  \ about to see light but Aravinda De Silvas fighting fifty and a dramatic Indian\
  \ batting collapse shattered that dream. The riots that followed would be remembered\
  \ as the most humiliating day in Indian Cricket.3- Lance Klusener - The Choke of\
  \ the Century1999 Semi-final against Australia, 16 ball 31 runsBy 1999 the Proteas\
  \ were the leading force in World cricket and arguably the most lethal unit in the\
  \ Cup. They were creating havocs in opponent ranks thanks to one of the most swashbuckling\
  \ hitters of all time. Lance Klusener had the natural ability to tear apart even\
  \ the most balanced and orchestrated bowling attack.The man they call Zulu was in\
  \ magical form, scoring 250 in 8 innings and also pocketing 17 important wickets.\
  \ But his fairytale run had to come to a sorry end, in the most dramatic fashion,\
  \ against the most worthy opponents, in one of the most thrilling matches ever contested.In\
  \ a fluctuating match that never seemed to have a clear winner, Klusener walked\
  \ in with South Africa needing 39 runs in 5 over\u2019s, Steve Waugh\u2019s men\
  \ were smelling victory, but to tease their nostrils Zulu was the last man standing.What\
  \ seemed like a daunting task, Klusener make it look like a walk in the park. With\
  \ 9 required from the last over, the hero of 96 semis Damien Fleming was trusted\
  \ to deliver once again. Klusener on the other hand showed no respect and hammered\
  \ the first 2 balls for consecutive boundaries. With the scores level only one was\
  \ required off 4 balls. That\u2019s where the panic happened and the term \u201C\
  Chokers\u201D gained substance. Klusener pushed the ball to mid-off for the winning\
  \ run, but he and his partner Allan Donald blundered with the basic principle of\
  \ running between the wickets. Australia moved to the finals while Klusener would\
  \ be remembered for this infamous comic, tragic and chock run out. 4- Wahab Riaz\
  \ \u2013 Viki\u2019s biggest yet saddest day2011 Semi-final against India, 5 for\
  \ 4630th March was a big day for 2011 World Cup, yet it turned out to be a day Wahab\
  \ Riaz would remember for his topsy turvy fortunes. Called in to replace knee nursing\
  \ Shoaib Akhtar, the lively Mohali pitch was ready for Wahab to bang in hard. Having\
  \ spent three sleepless nights cooking his strategy against Dhoni\u2019s men, both\
  \ Wahab and his luck were itching to shine.While the more experienced Umar Gul received\
  \ hammering, Wahab dried runs and kept picking big names. The highlight was dismissing\
  \ India\u2019s darling Yuvi on the first ball full toss, a ball enough to make Shoaib\
  \ himself jump in the dressing room. Wahab would then ignition the airplane celebration,\
  \ a trade mark registered by Shoaib himself. Wahab\u2019s first 5 wicket haul would\
  \ restrict India to a challenging 260 to defend, a job only to be made easy by yet\
  \ another Pakistani batting collapse.5- Mahela Jayawardene \u2013 The Big Match\

  \ 62 runs partnership with Sanga and made sure he survived the full 50 over\u2019\

  so far this year, according to figures collected by AFP as India counts the rising
  toll from floods that have devastated southern Kerala state.  The monsoon, which
  lasts from June to September, causes widespread death and destruction across South
  Asia each year, with the tourist hotspot of Kerala suffering its worst floods in
  nearly 100 years. Kerala has reported 445 deaths with more bodies discovered each

  to seek shelter in temporary relief camps and 15 others were reported missing up
  to Monday.  Kerala accounted for nearly half of the more than 1,000 deaths reported
  across India, with over 160 killed in neighbouring Karnataka state, more than 200
  fatalities in Uttar Pradesh state, and 195 in West Bengal, according to official
  figures. The monsoon also battered Nepal, with 87 people killed since June, according
  to the home ministry, including a woman and eight children swept away by a landslide
  in a remote village. But in Sri Lanka, where authorities organised the early evacuation
  of 750,000 people in threatened areas this year, the death toll from monsoon floods
  fell to 24 from 224 killed in May and June last year, official figures showed. In
  Bangladesh, floods and landslides killed at least 29 people, according to official
  figures. In the deadliest monsoon-induced disaster in recent years in South Asia,
  flooding and landslides killed around 5,800 people in India s northern Uttarakhand

  Momina said that it s an important theme that should be highlighted. Giving an example
  of her team s fellow female ambassadors, who happen to be female cricketers too,

  Girls should also excel in this field, she said. When asked that if other teams
  should also take a leaf out of Islamabad United s book as far as the addition of
  female cricket ambassadors goes, Momina said that not only franchises, the entire

text: 'United Nations investigators on Monday called for an international probe and
  prosecution of Myanmar''s army chief and five other top military commanders for
  genocide against the country''s Rohingya minority.  "Myanmar''s top military generals,
  including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated
  and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes
  against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States," a UN-backed
  fact-finding mission said. Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled northern Rakhine state
  to Bangladesh after Myanmar launched a brutal crackdown last August on insurgents
  amid accounts of arson, murder and rape at the hands of soldiers and vigilante mobs
  in the mainly Buddhist country. Myanmar has vehemently denied allegations of ethnic
  cleansing, insisting it was responding to attacks by Rohingya rebels.  But in Monday
  s report, the UN mission insisted the army tactics had been "consistently and grossly
  disproportionate to actual security threats." The mission, which was created by
  the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017, concluded in a report that "there is
  sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials
  in the Tatmadaw (Myanmar army) chain of command." "The crimes in Rakhine State,
  and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and
  scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,"
  the report said. The investigators named Min Aung Hlaing and five other top military
  commanders, adding that a longer list of names could be shared with "any competent
  and credible body pursuing accountability in line with international norms and standards."
  Criticism was also directed at Myanmar s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel
  Peace Prize laureate who has been the target of global vitriol for a perceived failure
  to stand up for the stateless minority. The report found that she had "not used
  her de facto position as head of government, nor her moral authority, to stem or
  prevent the unfolding events."  While acknowledging that she and other civilian
  authorities had little influence on military actions, it said that they "through
  their acts and omissions... have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes."
  The investigators called on the UN Security Council to refer the Myanmar situation
  to the International Criminal Court, or for an ad hoc international criminal tribunal
  to be created. They also recommended an arms embargo and "targeted individual sanctions
  against those who appear to be most responsible." '

text: 'Nearly half the world s schools lack clean drinking water, toilets and handwashing
  facilities, putting millions of children at risk of disease, experts warned on Monday.
  Almost 900 million children have to contend with a lack of basic hygiene facilities
  during their education, putting their health at risk and meaning some have to miss
  school.  You can t have a quality learning environment without these basics,  said
  Dr Rick Johnston of the World Health Organization, a lead researcher on the project.  Children
  may not come to school at all if there s no toilets ... Then, when they are at school,
  they are not going to at their very best if they not able to use a decent toilet
  or if they are not properly hydrated.  World leaders have signed up to global pledges
  to provide safe water and hygiene facilities for all and ensure every child gets
  a comprehensive education by 2030 under the UN s sustainable development goals.
  A lack of safe water and sanitation facilities can cause dehydration, illness, and
  even death. But many children are forced to risk their health to take part in classes,
  according to the report produced jointly by the United Nations Children s Fund UNICEF
  and the WHO, the first to look specifically at provision in schools. It found nearly
  a third of primary and secondary schools lacked a safe and reliable drinking water
  supply, affecting nearly 570 million children. Nearly 20 per cent of schools had
  no safe drinking water at all. Just over a third of schools lacked adequate toilet
  facilities, affecting more than 620 million children. Almost one in five primary
  schools and one in eight secondary schools were considered to have no sanitation.
  Nearly half lacked proper handwashing facilities, essential for helping prevent
  the spread of infections and disease. Nearly 900 million children were affected,
  the report found. Sub-Saharan Africa, East and Southeast Asia had some of the worst
  facilities.  It s deeply shocking,  Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of charity
  WaterAid, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The consequences are very broad
  in terms of children s access to education, general health and state of nutrition.  Adolescent
  girls in particular are often forced to miss classes when they are on their periods
  if there are no proper cleaning and sanitation facilities, he said. More than a
  third of girls in South Asia miss school during their periods, often because they
  lack access to toilets or pads, according to a WaterAid and UNICEF study earlier
  this year. The World Bank last year warned countries needed to quadruple spending
  to $150 billion a year to deliver universal safe water and sanitation. However,
  experts say they are optimistic the situation can be quickly improved if leaders
  treat water, sanitation and hygiene as a priority.  With political will, it really
  is possible to deliver good quality services,  said Johnston. '

  names in the team. Akram had to resign and Salim Malik was installed as the compromise
  captain.From then onwards, the breach could never be healed and the Demon of Mistrust
  kept rising its ugly face time to time. Friendship amongst the two was all but buried
  and the desire for revenge brewed with every possible opportunity.           Big
  year   Big Fights1999 was the eventful year when differences between the two were
  elevated to the next level. They were hardly at talking terms during the short tour
  of India and poor Inzi had to run around playing the courier guy. But it was the
  World Cup in England where Wasim actually got to test Waqar s nerves.Despite all
  of Wasim s tactics, Waqar somehow did find a place in the touring squad but remained
  mostly on the bench. The fire spitting Shoaib Akthar was at his fiercely best and
  that gave Wasim a good reason to curb his role to a water boy. Waqar only featured
  in the fateful game against Bangladesh while Wasim s dream of walking high like
  Imran Khan were shattered by Kangaroos in the finals.The rivalry resurfaced again
  in the later part of the year when Pakistan faced Australians in their backyard.
  Waqar was made to sit out the first test and Pakistan were hammed with a 10 wicket
  defeat. Waqar by now had passed his boiling point and decided to speak out in the
  press against Wasim, arguing that Akram s long-term grudge was ruining his career
  and the best place to settle that bitterness was inside a room and not on the ground.This
  outburst resulted in Waqar putting on his spikes in the Hobart test. His impact
  was felt immediately when he trapped Mark Waugh, next to follow was his trademark
  in-swinger that removed Rickey Ponting for a duck. The jubilation in Waqar s follow-through
  was a clear reminder for Wasim that he could keep Waqar out of cricket, but certainly
  not cricket out of Waqar. Sadly Waqar faced an ankle injury and sat out the last
  test.Wasim lost the captaincy after the 3-0 drubbing and Waqar got the armband during
  the 2001 England tour. Around this time the whistle blowing Justice Qayyum report
  came out highlighting the Evil of Match Fixing and greed in Pakistan cricket. Apart
  from other suggestions, one was never to let Wasim captain his country again. Wasim
  kept playing under Waqar s captaincy for the next year and a half, but these once
  good friends kept their fiercest revelries saved for the World Cup, neither having
  a heart big enough to let the other capture a permanent place in the countries folklore.2003
  World Cup, tempering the Bad-BloodWasim had a rocking World Cup where he bagged
  3 against Australia in the opening match, and then took 3 against Netherlands to
  reach the magical 500 haul. He couldn t kill any Indian batsmen in the all important
  Centurion game and this was perhaps convinced Waqar of deliberate underperformance.In
  the next game against Zimbabwe, rain sealed Pakistan s early exit from the tournament.
  While the nation was in shock, TV screens showed a relaxed and somewhat content
  looking Wasim standing outside the dressing room and warmly greeting the Zimbabwean
  players, this only added more wood to the already blazing fire.The bitter rivalry
  had cracked yet another cup and the curtain fell simultaneously on the careers of
  two most illustrious fast bowlers of modern times.In April 2004, while India was
  touring Pakistan, Waqar announced his retirement. During a packed News conference
  in an Islamabad hotel, Waqar minced no words in disclosing that he mistrusted a
  Few Friends during the 2003 Cup. His book would reveal the true story and characters.
  Both have maintained that age and maturity has over taken the bitter taste and good
  sense prevails, sadly that s only true till and before the World Cup.For the mega
  event the expectations from Pakistani bowlers were always high, but Waqar s boys
  have so far failed to impact mattering opponents. Wasim is in Australia and has
  repeatedly shown his willingness to shoulder the falling apart bowling line and
  put the spark in their plugs, but perhaps his help is as un-welcoming as his presence
  in the Pakistani dressing room. While Waqar was made to keep towers dry and bottles
  filled during the 99 Cup, he must have kept repeating to himself the basic coaching
  tip,  Wait for the bad ball . It s his time now and he is solely calling the shots
  like the powerful before him did. By keeping Wasim out, his shattered Ego would
  definitely see satisfaction, but it might come at the cost of another broken Cup.                                   '

language: en
publisher: Geo News
summary: null
tags:
- world
text: 'Iran s legal challenge against renewed sanctions by the United States goes
  before the UN s International Court of Justice on Monday.  Here are four key questions
  regarding the case: What is the case about? Iran s attempt to block the reinstatement
  of sanctions, announced by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, is the latest
  in a series of court battles that Tehran and Washington are fighting at the ICJ.  Trump
  announced on May 8 that he was pulling out of a landmark deal between Iran and major
  powers aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The deal agreed
  with the UN s five permanent Security Council members and Germany in 2015 limits
  Tehran s stockpile of enriched uranium until 2031 in exchange for sanctions relief.
  Blasting the accord as a "horrible, one-sided deal", Trump reimposed a wave of tough,
  unilateral sanctions. Tehran now accuses Washington of "besieging" its economy and
  wants the Hague-based court   which rules in disputes between countries   to order
  the US to temporarily halt punitive measures, while the judges mull the deeper merits
  of the case. Does Tehran have a case? The case has two elements, said Eric De Brabandere,
  professor of international dispute settlement at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
  Firstly, "Iran genuinely considers the re-imposition of sanctions a violation of
  international law." Secondly, "Iran has the support of many European states on the
  question of sanctions, politically speaking," De Brabandere argued. Iran s representatives
  need to convince the ICJ that its 15 permanent judges indeed have the jurisdiction
  to hear the case. Tehran bases its arguments on a little-known 1955 treaty between
  Iran and the United States. The treaty provides for "friendly relations" between
  the two countries, encourages mutual trade and investment and regulates consular
  relations. However, there have been no formal diplomatic ties between Tehran and
  Washington since the regime of the US-backed Shah was deposed by Iran''s revolution
  in 1979. What will Washington argue? "My guess is that for this case they will argue
  that the court has no jurisdiction, as they did in a separate case launched against
  the US two years ago," said De Brabandere. Washington could invoke two arguments.
  One is that the 1955 treaty is no longer in force, because it is a "treaty of friendship"
  between two nations which have been adversaries for the last four decades. Secondly,
  US representatives could say that the dispute was "not about the treaty, but about
  sanctions and Iran s alleged terrorist activities," De Brabandere said. "The US
  is likely to argue that the dispute is about something much broader than a treaty,"
  for instance Tehran s nuclear ambitions, the expert said. Furthermore, there is
  a clause in the 1955 treaty which allows the states to take "any measures to protect
  essential security interests." Can Iran s case succeed? "I think it s very likely
  that the ICJ will, based on the 1955 treaty, decide to hear the case," said De Brabandere.
  However, whether the case will be successful on its own merits -- in other words
  whether the United States indeed breached its obligations -- is more difficult to
  establish. "For one, the 1955 treaty is relatively narrow in scope. It means that
  the ICJ can only rule whether the US violated its obligations under the specific
  treaty," De Brabandere said. This means that the ICJ s judges will not rule in what
  they may consider any broader dispute between Iran and the United States. The outcome
  of the case   which could still take years before being handed down   "is very difficult
  to predict," said De Brabandere. '

text: 'THE HAGUE: Iran will argue Monday against renewed sanctions imposed by the
  United States, as a bitter legal battle between Tehran and Washington opens before
  the UN s top court. US President Donald Trump reimposed a wave of tough unilateral
  sanctions on Iran three weeks ago, bringing back into effect harsh penalties that
  had been lifted under a landmark 2015 agreement. A second round of measures is to
  come into effect in early November, targeting Iran s valuable oil and energy sector.
  Tehran filed its case before the International Court of Justice in late July, calling
  on the Hague-based tribunal s judges to order the immediate lifting of sanctions,
  which it said would cause "irreparable prejudice." The US had no right to reinstate
  such measures, Tehran added, as it demanded compensation for damages. Iran maintained
  restoring the penalties lifted under the historic 2015 deal, aimed at curbing Tehran
  s nuclear ambitions, violated a decades-old treaty signed between the two nations
  in 1955. The ICJ -- set up in 1946 to rule in disputes between countries -- is expected
  to take a couple of months to decide whether to grant Tehran s request for a provisional
  ruling, while a final decision in the case may actually still take years. Trump
  described the 2015 deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the United
  Nations Security Council, as well as Germany, as a "horrible one-sided deal (that)
  failed to achieve the fundamental objective of blocking all paths to a Iranian nuclear
  bomb." Even though all of the other parties pleaded with him not to abandon the
  pact, Trump pulled out and announced he would reinstate sanctions.  Neither war,
  nor negotiations  Tehran -- which argues that the move violates the little-known
  1955 Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations -- says that the new sanctions are already
  hurting its economy. Iran s currency the rial has lost around half its value since
  April. A raft of international companies -- including France s Total, Peugeot and
  Renault, and Germany s Siemens and Daimler -- have suspended operations in Iran
  in the wake of the move. Both Air France and British Airways announced Thursday
  they were halt flights to Tehran next month, saying they were not commercially viable,
  but the British carrier added the decision was unrelated to the new tranche of sanctions.
  In his executive order, Trump argued that the sanctions would turn up the financial
  pressure on Tehran to come to a "comprehensive and lasting solution" regarding activities
  that the international community regarded as "malign" such as Iran s "ballistic
  missile programme and its support for terrorism." Earlier this month, Iran s supreme
  leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to rule out any immediate prospect of talks,
  saying "there will be neither war, nor negotiations," with the US. Washington s
  lawyers will present their case on Tuesday, with experts believing they are to challenge
  the ICJ s jurisdiction. '

  not cricket out of Waqar. Sadly Waqar faced an ankle injury and sat out the last
  test.Wasim lost the captaincy after the 3-0 drubbing and Waqar got the armband during
  the 2001 England tour. Around this time the whistle blowing Justice Qayyum report
  came out highlighting the Evil of Match Fixing and greed in Pakistan cricket. Apart
  from other suggestions, one was never to let Wasim captain his country again. Wasim
  kept playing under Waqar s captaincy for the next year and a half, but these once
  good friends kept their fiercest revelries saved for the World Cup, neither having
  a heart big enough to let the other capture a permanent place in the countries folklore.2003
  World Cup, tempering the Bad-BloodWasim had a rocking World Cup where he bagged
  3 against Australia in the opening match, and then took 3 against Netherlands to
  reach the magical 500 haul. He couldn t kill any Indian batsmen in the all important
  Centurion game and this was perhaps convinced Waqar of deliberate underperformance.In
  the next game against Zimbabwe, rain sealed Pakistan s early exit from the tournament.
  While the nation was in shock, TV screens showed a relaxed and somewhat content
  looking Wasim standing outside the dressing room and warmly greeting the Zimbabwean
  players, this only added more wood to the already blazing fire.The bitter rivalry
  had cracked yet another cup and the curtain fell simultaneously on the careers of
  two most illustrious fast bowlers of modern times.In April 2004, while India was
  touring Pakistan, Waqar announced his retirement. During a packed News conference
  in an Islamabad hotel, Waqar minced no words in disclosing that he mistrusted a
  Few Friends during the 2003 Cup. His book would reveal the true story and characters.
  Both have maintained that age and maturity has over taken the bitter taste and good
  sense prevails, sadly that s only true till and before the World Cup.For the mega
  event the expectations from Pakistani bowlers were always high, but Waqar s boys
  have so far failed to impact mattering opponents. Wasim is in Australia and has
  repeatedly shown his willingness to shoulder the falling apart bowling line and
  put the spark in their plugs, but perhaps his help is as un-welcoming as his presence
  in the Pakistani dressing room. While Waqar was made to keep towers dry and bottles
  filled during the 99 Cup, he must have kept repeating to himself the basic coaching
  tip,  Wait for the bad ball . It s his time now and he is solely calling the shots
  like the powerful before him did. By keeping Wasim out, his shattered Ego would
  definitely see satisfaction, but it might come at the cost of another broken Cup.                                   '

text: 'Many European Union member states have failed the migrant victims of torture
  and trauma by not having systems in place to recognise the ordeals they have suffered,
  and support them on arrival. Such trauma if left untreated can scar them and their
  families for life, and may lead to suicide. These are some of the findings from
  the latest summary report of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) on migration-related
  fundamental rights concerns in select EU member states. It examines how victims
  are being handled by national authorities to highlight how to best offer them the
  protection they are entitled to. Many migrants and asylum seekers have fled or experienced
  extreme suffering in their home countries or en route to Europe. This includes physical
  and psychological violence, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. Lengthy bureaucracy,
  uncertainty about the outcome of asylum proceedings and poor reception conditions
  can compound their suffering. In Denmark alone, there were 120 suicide attempts
  and incidents of suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in 2016, of which 29 were
  by children. Despite international and EU laws guarding against such treatment offering
  support to victims, many member states are falling short of their duties, the report
  shows. Some of the report s main findings include:  1. The true extent of suffering
  is hard to gauge as only limited data on the victims of torture and trauma and on
  suicide attempts is collected in the 13 member states studied. Only Greece regularly
  collects information on torture victims.  2.  Recurrent violence or the excessive
  use of force by state officials or those working on their behalf was not found although
  there were cases of individual and localised incidents. However, serious incidents
  are more frequent along EU external border zones.  3.  Identifying victims is problematic
  given the lack of formal screening procedures. Instead countries heavily rely on
  the expertise and knowledge of individual staff, although tools are increasingly
  being developed to facilitate identification by non-experts.   4.  Access to support
  is limited by the number of specialised medical staff who can provide psychological
  or psychiatric help. The lack of staff often leads to long waiting periods; for
  example, in Germany around 5,600 asylum seekers waited over a year to receive treatment.
  It is also a challenge starting therapy when asylum applicants are homeless or live
  in reception facilities that are not adequate to sustain the therapy.   5.  Despite
  training, monitoring bodies and complaints mechanisms in all member states, their
  effectiveness in preventing ill-treatment varies from country to country. Despite
  the lack of attention to torture and trauma victims, the report also identifies
  promising practices that other member states could adopt to identify and support
  victims. The European Commission asked the Agency for Fundamental Rights to collect
  data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in member states,
  particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 member
  states: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy,
  the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. '

text: 'KARACHI: The Federal Government and provinces are neither serious about nor
  taking an interest in holding population and housing census in the country. It s
  a legal obligation imposed on the Federal Government in the Federal Legislative
  list of fourth schedule to the Constitution; nevertheless, hurdles are being created
  to delay or stop the sixth census in Pakistan, as mentioned in Aam log Ittehad Petition
  filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. According to Petitioner Justice (retd) Wajihuddin
  Ahmed, Acting Chairman Aam Loeg Ittehad:  While the first four censuses were more
  or less regularly and duly held in the years 1951, 1961, 1972 and 1981, the fifth
  census was undertaken in 1998 after 17 years, an inordinate delay of 7 years which
  was certainly avoidable. That is not to say that the pervious censuses were problem
  free.  However, we are now in the 21st century and living in the Information Age,
  with little or no scope for such aberrations.  Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed said in
  a separate statement:  None of the governments are serious in the matter, though
  for different reasons. The Federal Government is engaged in a mechanical exercise,
  solely because it has to honor its undertaking before the apex court. The sardars
  and Khans of Balochistan and KP feel threatened that once their impecunious and
  burgeoning populations are quantified, their own lavish and luxurious lifestyles
  would come under scrutiny. The Sindh government, which exclusively represents rural
  Sindh, is determined to inflate the numbers in rural areas and decimate those in
  urban Sindh.  Justice Wajih further said that the census is an activity necessary
  to assess the needs on the basis of population, and this act will be beneficial
  for human rights. The petition points out that the leadership of Punjab is no wiser.
  It is fully aware that the proportion of their population is slowly declining and
  if census is held it would no longer be officially reflected as being 55.63% of
  the population of Pakistan. The estimated Punjab population, as per the 2011 Housing
  Census, is 47.69%. In the previous census of 1998, while a slower per annum growth
  rate of 2.64% in Punjab was recorded, Sindh registered a growth rate of 2.80% per
  annum. The petition further states that if this trend continues, it is bound to
  have a negative impact on the 148 National Assembly seats allocated to the province
  of Punjab under the Constitution. In order to maintain and ensure the numerical
  majority of the province of Punjab in the population census of Pakistan, some functionaries
  of the Punjab government are keen to have the exercise of the forthcoming census
  abandoned. The notables of Punjab need to realise that if the present population
  ratio of their province is unrealistically maintained and reflected to be higher
  than it actually is, history may repeat itself. In similar circumstances, the former
  province of East Pakistan, having a 54% share of the total population, seceded,
  not the least for the reason that the former province of West Pakistan was not in
  favour of the idea of remaining a permanent minority province, says the petition.
  The petition notes that the situation is particularly sensitive in Sindh because
  at this eleventh hour the government is proactively pursuing the issuance of CNICs
  in rural areas. It is no secret that the government of Sindh only and exclusively
  represents rural Sindh, with a predictable tilt in that direction. Its unchecked
  participation in the census exercise, which, as stated in the preceding paragraph,
  is a Federal subject/entry, occurring in Part II of the Federal Legislative List,
  controlled by Articles 153(4) and 154 (1) (6) ), is likely to produce unacceptable
  results. Aam Loeg Ittehad petition states that there is hue and cry in Balochistan
  that if the current census, in the present situation, is carried out the Baloch
  people shall be relegated to being a minority in their own province. Nothing can
  be farther from the truth. The Baloch people, who are purported to have moved to
  Sindh and Punjab, can easily be counted at their present places of residence.  And
  if some Afghan refugees, in Balochistan, now possess Pakistan CNICs, they can always
  be carefully screened and excluded from the head count of the forthcoming population
  census. Thereafter, their illegal Pakistan CNICs can be replaced by other distinctive
  cards of identification. Much the same is the position in KP, where provincial leaders
  have shown apprehension that if some migrants from Afghanistan, who are unlawfully
  holding Pakistan CNICs, are counted, as part of the population, the Pashtuns would
  be converted into a minority. That also is as illogical a position as taken by the
  Baloch sardars. For one thing, an inflated KP population would bring similar benefits,
  as in the case of Balochistan and in any case the electoral process would remain
  unaffected, as in the case of Balochistan, states the petition. It has been requested
  of the Honorable Court to direct the Federal Government to assume full jurisdiction
  in the matter of the forthcoming census and provide directions and guidance to the
  Council of Common Interests, as and when necessary. The Court has also been appealed
  to direct the Federal and Provincial Governments of Pakistan to ensure full, complete
  and absolute compliance of law and the Constitution in the matter of the forthcoming
  census. Census is not just for the head-count of Pakistani citizens (CNIC holders)
  but of all persons in Pakistan who must be counted on the basis of due and verifiable
  particulars and only after securing due clarification of valid CNIC holders. The
  petition has further requested the Court to issue directions to NADRA, through the
  Chair NADRA to cancel all illegal CNICs and, where needed, to issue other cards/insignias
  for identification of persons holding illegal CNICs. And also to prohibit NADRA
  from issuing new CNICs at least one month prior to the start of the first phase
  of the census. It has also been requested that the Court prohibit all Provincial
  Governments from any and all direct or indirect interaction with the census functionaries,
  and to ensure that no census result is announced until the Armed Forces  component
  of the census personnel expressly approves it. '

text: 'United Nations investigators on Monday called for an international probe and
  prosecution of Myanmar''s army chief and five other top military commanders for
  genocide against the country''s Rohingya minority.  "Myanmar''s top military generals,
  including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated
  and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes
  against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States," a UN-backed
  fact-finding mission said. Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled northern Rakhine state
  to Bangladesh after Myanmar launched a brutal crackdown last August on insurgents
  amid accounts of arson, murder and rape at the hands of soldiers and vigilante mobs
  in the mainly Buddhist country. Myanmar has vehemently denied allegations of ethnic
  cleansing, insisting it was responding to attacks by Rohingya rebels.  But in Monday
  s report, the UN mission insisted the army tactics had been "consistently and grossly
  disproportionate to actual security threats." The mission, which was created by
  the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017, concluded in a report that "there is
  sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials
  in the Tatmadaw (Myanmar army) chain of command." "The crimes in Rakhine State,
  and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and
  scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,"
  the report said. The investigators named Min Aung Hlaing and five other top military
  commanders, adding that a longer list of names could be shared with "any competent
  and credible body pursuing accountability in line with international norms and standards."
  Criticism was also directed at Myanmar s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel
  Peace Prize laureate who has been the target of global vitriol for a perceived failure
  to stand up for the stateless minority. The report found that she had "not used
  her de facto position as head of government, nor her moral authority, to stem or
  prevent the unfolding events."  While acknowledging that she and other civilian
  authorities had little influence on military actions, it said that they "through
  their acts and omissions... have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes."
  The investigators called on the UN Security Council to refer the Myanmar situation
  to the International Criminal Court, or for an ad hoc international criminal tribunal
  to be created. They also recommended an arms embargo and "targeted individual sanctions
  against those who appear to be most responsible." '

text: "LONDON: Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) branch of the\
  \ Pakistan Army, Major General Asim Bajwa addressed the Royal United Services Institute\
  \ (RUSI), a leading think tank in London on Thursday. The DG ISPR, spoke on the\
  \ role of the Pakistan Army in countering terrorism, rendering great sacrifices.\
  \ He explained how the army freed areas from Taliban control adding that the strategic\
  \ objective was to deny them use of Pakistan\u2019s territory to achieve lasting\
  \ peace.Bajwa told the think tank in his address, that with the aim of eliminating\
  \ terrorism and ending militant links in the area to establish the writ of the state\
  \ and to improve governance in the area, the army began its operation from the North\
  \ in Bajaur agency and made its way down. He recalled how Swat was taken over by\
  \ terrorists and how the army went in to eliminate them after the Tehrik-e-Taliban\
  \ Pakistan (TTP) began flogging people meting out their brand of justice. The operation\
  \ was lauded by the United Nations as the most successful operation. Zarb-e-AzbBajwa\
  \ shared, that the government made efforts to negotiate with the terrorists to address\
  \ the matter through dialogue, but that didn't help. Then the terrorists attacked\
  \ one of the country\u2019s major airports in Karachi which was a defining point\
  \ to launch Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Prior to the launch of operation Zarb-e-Azb, Bajwa\
  \ added, the Army Chief issued clear instructions that the operation will be against\
  \ terrorists of all hues and colour without any discrimination. That collateral\
  \ damage must be avoided even at the cost of delayed progress in the operation and\
  \ that no human rights violations should take place. He explained that Operation\
  \ Zarb-e-Azb is not an end in itself, it is a national effort involving all segments\
  \ of Pakistani society determined to root out terrorism from Pakistan and it aims\
  \ at restoring the writ of the government through use of military intervention,\
  \ destroying safe-havens and terrorist hideouts, eliminating all kinds of terrorists.Bajwa\
  \ shared, that Operation Zarb-e-Azb is continuing successfully. As a result over\
  \ 2000 terrorists have been killed in North Waziristan and elsewhere, he added that\
  \ the price being paid is also high, over 200 soldiers have laid down their lives\
  \ and nearly 800 have been injured. Bajwa added, that the Army has dismantled the\
  \ terror economy, their funding sources need to be choked he added that their finances\
  \ must be choked to end the reign of terror. Situation in North WaziristanBajwa\
  \ explained that the Taliban were using safe havens in North Waziristan to operate,\
  \ they had communication systems, were manufacturing bombs and explosive material\
  \ for their nefarious terror objectives. Border CrossingDue to Pakistan\u2019s porous\
  \ borders, Bajwa said, the Taliban were able to cross over to Afghanistan due to\
  \ their existing links. He added, that ISAF and the Afghan security forces were\
  \ informed well before the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb about the border-crossing\
  \ and in some cases they met with success while in others they are still struggling.\
  \ Khyber AgencyThe DG ISPR explains that the Army went into Khyber Agency to clear\
  \ the area and to sever links that the terrorists were trying to reestablish, adding\
  \ that they met with success due to good cooperation with the Afghan and ISAF forces.\
  \ Bajwa added, that when forces went in, they discovered that the terrorists were\
  \ very well equipped and would have been able to cause great damage. Rehabilitation\
  \ InitiativesBajwa told the think tank, that Pakistan has started various social\
  \ economic development projects within the tribal areas to bring dividends to the\
  \ locals through trade and economic development, adding that a general trade corridor\
  \ has been created to expedite trade.Pakistan is addressing the root causes of the\
  \ problem and is initiating projects in fields of education, rehabilitating schools,\
  \ reviewing the curriculum and enabling young girls to attend schools.Bajwa said,\
  \ Pakistan is grateful to its friends from across the world, the donors who are\
  \ helping our efforts, their help is much appreciated, adding that a comprehensive\
  \ plan is in place to look after the IDP\u2019s and rehabilitate them as soon as\
  \ possible which includes cooperation with all relevant civilian agencies.  Border\
  \ IssuesOn the issue of Pakistan\u2019s porous border, Bajwa explained, that it\
  \ was difficult to seal the Eastern border with Afghanistan and the border with\
  \ Iran, adding that was a big challenge. He added that Pakistan has a 3000 km Eastern\
  \ border with India and others. He shared that Pakistan\u2019s neighbours keep hurling\
  \ allegations. He said border violations from India are distracting Pakistan from\
  \ the task we have on the western side, we have shown lots of restraint. Pakistan\
  \ has been offering peace while India has shown arrogance. They cancelled secretary\
  \ level talks, accused Pakistan wrongly adding that there is a method to their madness.\
  \ They are trying to distract our attention, while we want peace and we have offered\
  \ it many times. He said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has gone to great lengths.\
  \ He met Narendra Modi and our foreign office went out of the way, we offered DG\
  \ level talks. It helped to some extent, but what do you do when there is military\
  \ violation and then they blame Pakistan instead \u2013 that doesn\u2019t help,\
  \ he added. Bajwa said, things are right there for everyone to see adding that Pakistan\
  \ expects everyone to play their role to bring peace. India needs to understand,\
  \ that Pakistan is not oblivious to what is happening in India. There is the festering\
  \ wound of the unresolved issue of Kashmir, it is one of the major issues n the\
  \ way of peace between India and Pakistan. BalochistanOn the issue of Balochistan,\
  \ the DG ISPR explained that it is a national problem and that Pakistan has been\
  \ raising the issue of external interference at every level. He said, the porous\
  \ nature of the border hinders full control of the state adding that Baloch militants\
  \ have links and bases inside Afghanistan where Ferrari camps are present. He explained\
  \ that militancy of this nature cannot sustain without external influence for long\
  \ without financing from abroad and that much of it was taking place as a result\
  \ of foreign help but said he did not want to name any country. Military CourtsOn\
  \ the issue of military courts, Bajwa said, that the entire justice system has not\
  \ come under military domain, explaining that military courts are a stop gap arrangement\
  \ due to the existing capacity issue of Pakistan\u2019s judicial system. He clarified\
  \ that military courts will only deal with terrorists. Madrasa ReformsThe decision\
  \ to reform madrasa\u2019s has been taken against those seminaries that abet and\
  \ facilitate terrorists or those who sympathize with terrorists. He added, that\
  \ warrants against Maulana Aziz (the Lal Masjid cleric) have been issued and that\
  \ it was only a matter of execution now. He said, the government has taken its decision\
  \ against terrorism adding that everything does not happen overnight. The government\
  \ is serious about dealing with anyone who sympathizes with or promotes terrorism\
  \ in any form, he added."

text: 'JAKARTA: China s Su Bingtian was crowned Asia s fastest man on Sunday, justifying
  the hype surrounding him by winning the blue riband 100 metres sprint gold in an
  Asian Games record time.  Su became the first Asian-born sprinter to run the distance
  in under 10 seconds in June when he clocked 9.91 twice in the space of eight days,
  matching the Asian record held by Qatar s Nigerian-born Femi Ogunode. On Sunday,
  he held off his opponents with a late burst of speed to win the event in 9.92 seconds,
  ahead of Nigerian-born Qatari Tosin Ogunode, who clocked 10.00, on a hot and humid
  night in the Indonesian capital.  It wasn t about the time, it was about getting
  the win,  Su, 28, told reporters.  I knew that if I got a good start then I can
  t be beaten.  Japan s Ryota Yamagata was credited with the same time as Ogunode
  and won bronze. Indonesian teenager Lalu Muhammad Zohri ran a personal best of 10.20
  but it was good enough for only seventh spot. The crowd at the Gelora Bung Karno
  Stadium was in for a surprise in the women s 100m final when Nigerian-born Edidiong
  Odiong of Bahrain was adjudged the winner in a photo-finish over India s Dutee Chand,
  who lost her lead in the last few metres. The 21-year-old Odiong clocked 11.30 to
  be crowned Asia s fastest woman. Chand was cleared to race in 2015 following a Court
  of Arbitration for Sport ruling on gender testing guidelines. The Lausanne-based
  court suspended the governing International Association of Athletics Federations  regulations
  regarding hyperandrogenism, a condition which produces high testosterone levels
  allowing Chand to compete again after a year sat out. Pre-race favourite Wei Yongli
  of China, who recently became the first Asian woman to break the 11-second barrier,
  had topped the timings in Saturday s heats and also the semi-finals but had to be
  satisfied with a bronze. Sudan-born Abdalelah Hassan gave Qatar its first gold medal
  at the 18th Asian Games in the men s 400m, finishing ahead of India s Muhammed Anas
  in 44.89 seconds. Ali Khamis won the bronze for Bahrain. Salwa Naser maintained
  Bahrain s hold on the women s 400m, following in the footsteps of Kemi Adekoya,
  who won the event in Incheon, South Korea, four years ago. The Nigerian-born Naser,
  who won silver at the world championships last year, comfortably won in an Asian
  Games record time of 50.09. India s Hima Das, the under-20 world champion, won silver
  while Elina Mikhina claimed bronze for Kazakhstan. Women s shot put world champion
  Gong Lijiao and Gao Yang made it a one-two for China although Gong s distance of
  19.66m was over two metres more than her compatriot. China has now won gold in the
  women s shot put at each of the last 11 Asian Games, dating back to 1978. China
  also took the top two positions in the men s long jump when Wang Jianan and Zhang
  Yaoguang won the gold and silver medals respectively. Bahrain also had their one-two
  moment on the night when Moroccan-born Hassan Chani and Kenyan-born Abraham Cheroben
  won the gold and silver respectively in the men s 10,000m. India s Govindan Lakshmanan
  won the bronze but was later disqualified for stepping off the track during the
  race. Jung Hye-lim won the women s 100m hurdles to give South Korea their first
  Asiad gold in athletics in eight years. Silver medallist Emilia Nova became the
  first Indonesian woman to win a track medal since Supriati Sutono s 5000m gold in
  1998.  This silver medal means a lot. Two weeks ago my hip flexor hurt but the past
  week I managed the pain. Because of the Asian Games, I just ignored the pain,  Nova
  said. '

text: 'LAHORE: The National College of Arts in Lahore on Friday announced a week''s
  holiday, after which the hostel administration ordered students to immediately vacate
  their dormitories. The NCA administration ordered students to vacate three hostels;
  two for boys and a girls'' dormitory. With this, around 300 students, male and female,
  have been stranded due to administration negligence. All of these students come
  from distant cities and areas in the province, while some hail from outside Punjab.
  Geo News has learnt that police had given a notice to hostel administration a week
  ago. They said that they had repeatedly asked the administration to improve security,
  before finally getting the hostels vacated tonight upon non-compliance of orders
  by admin staff. Reached for comment, hostel administration declined the request.
  Police said the hostels will not be reopened until adequate security arrangements
  are made. The situation also perplexed the parents of the students, who questioned
  where would their children go at this hour of night. The students, outside the hostels,
  were found calling their relatives and friends in Lahore in search of a temporary
  place to stay at. No institute asked to get hostels vacated: DIG On the other hand,
  DIG Operations Lahore Haider Ashraf denied that the police asked NCA administration
  to get the hostels vacated. "We have not asked administration of any educational
  institution to get its hostels vacated," Ashraf said, adding that police were providing
  foolproof security to all institutes. '

text: 'The equation for Pakistan is crystal clear, defeat the South Africans or go
  pack your bags. As the World Cup pool stage approaches its pointy end, both teams
  would look to pocket the all important 2 points, but for different reasons. South
  Africa, for a jab at the top slot, for Pakistan it s a question of survival.While
  fans would love to watch leather bang hard on willow, there are good chances that
  mother nature might step in at Auckland and spoil the fun with possible thundering
  showers.As the big hitters from both sides adjust their grips and the quickies tighten
  their spikes for the cut-through fixture, how about getting a bit nostalgic and
  re-collect some golden moments from days gone by?The Protease and Green shirts have
  fought their battles hard and given fans some memorable treats to cherish. From
  the first time they locked horns at the 92 Cup till the last arm-lock in Centurion,
  it s been all about pure passion, challenge and hunger for success. Keeping such
  history in mind, both teams are expected to produce a lot of bang and smoke on Saturday.Let
  s revisit some moments that refuse to leave our collections.1. Jhonty steals Inzi
  and the three Stumps   Crickets Superman hits the groundWe have all seen it hundreds
  of times and still never get tired of it, probably the most spectacular moment from
  a cricket field. The iconic image of the airborne Jhonty, horizontal to the last
  limb, flying through the air and defying laws of gravity to demolish all three stumps.
  A mind boggling stunt that would make even the legendary Christopher Reeve bite
  his fingers.The magical moment was captured by famed cricket photographer Patrick
  Eager and became a part of the games folklore. Jhonty recognition before the run
  out was limited to that of a struggling middle order batsman who wasn t contributing
  enough runs but would save 20 odd runs in fielding. But that one picture changed
  his existence.Ask him today and Jhonty is still unsure if it was his leap against
  gravity or the click of the camera that made him the poster boy of World Cricket.2.
  Waqar Younis 4-62 at Sharjah Cup Final   The return of the wounded TigerWhat a match
  for fans, what a match for Pakistan and what a match for Waqar Younis it was. Being
  thrashed by Australia in the tour Down under, Wasim Akram was dethroned from Captaincy
  and Pakistan came to play the Sharjah Cup under a new leader, Moin Khan.Waqar was
  kept on the side lines by Wasim and it was his time to hit back. Although he had
  a rocking tournament, but the Burewala Express kept his best for the finals against
  the mighty South Africans. Defending a total of 263, Waqar s middle order burst
  kept a check on the Protease and gave Moin Khan his first tournament win as a captain.And
  not to forget from the same match was Inzaman s cracking off drive that nearly blew
  Nantie Haywards head.3. Afridi s Flying Kiss to Jacque Kallis   Kallis Chaumma DedeAs
  the old saying goes, you can expect anything from Shahid Afridi, but here was an
  act as bizarre as it can get. It was the Semifinal of the T-20 WC at Nottingham,
  Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat. The last ball of the 4th over, Afridi
  wacked a short one from Kallis over wide midwicket for four.It was one of the hundreds
  of boundaries Afridi struck in his career, but what he did next caught every one
  off guard and astonished Kallis. Out of the blue, Afridi blew him a kiss but Kallis
  wasn t thrilled. This was tempting food for TV channels who did not miss a chance
  to milk out ratings. The foot tapping Amitabh hit  Jumma Chaumma Dede  blended perfectly
  and also generated thousand of hits on YouTube.4. Abdul Razzaq s rampant century
  at Abu DhabiPakistan had lost the first match and badly needed a win to bounce back
  in the series. Same was the case with Razzaq who was ping ponged in and out of the
  team. Chasing a target of 286, Pakistan were bruised at 5-136 when Razzaq took guard.
  It was the perfect setting for Razzaq who grabbed the opportunity with both hands
  and showered a 72 ball 109 that included 10 sixes and 7 fours. In his own words,
  this was the most memorable and fighting innings he ever played.5.Fanie de Villiers
  Cycling joy and Hansie Cronje s Tanga jockey funWe have all seem them; we have all
  lived through them. Pakistan has seen much better days then the ones currently flashed
  to the world. Foreign teams used to visit Pakistan multiple times every year, they
  used to play hard and rubbishing aside the cultural shock syndrome, used to merge
  and enjoy the tastes of Pakistan s rich and colorful culture. Every time Pakistan
  play their home series in UAE, the images of Fanie de Villiers enjoying his cycle
  ride in Faisalabad s Famous  Ghanta Ghar Chowk , or the Late Hansie Cronje hacking
  the Tanga at Rawalpindi s  Raja Bazar , remind of the golden days of Pakistan Cricket.
  The smile of their faces tells the complete story, how secure and welcomed they
  felt in the land of pure.Only South Africa can fell Pakistan s pain, they themselves
  suffered international isolation for 27 years and went through the painful apartheid
  segregation. Only they can realize the agony behind empty stands and dusty grounds.
  They have helped us before, they could again stretch their hands and allow Pakistani
  fans to make some noise in those empty stands.                                                         '

  \ was chief of the banned LeJ\u2019s Balochistan chapter and was the most wanted\
  \ terrorist in the province. The provincial government had announced a reward or\
  \ \u2018head money\u2019 of Rs. 2.5 million. Speaking to Geo News the Quetta Police\

  \ card was recovered from his pocket bearing the name Ghulam Sarwar, but his identity\
  \ is yet to be confirmed\u201D told the source. On an intelligence tip-off, a special\
  \ unit of the Frontier Corps Balochistan raided a hotel in Shaal Kot, Karachi Road\
  \ area of Saryab. In the exchange of fire that followed between terrorists and the\
  \ law enforcers Saifullah Kurd was gunned down along with his accomplice. One law\
  \ enforcer embraced martyrdom while 4 others were injured. Weapons and mobile phones\
  \ were also recovered from Kurd\u2019s possession. Intelligence sources revealed,\
  \ that Kurd was a known terrorist and the mastermind of all major sectarian attacks\
  \ in Balochistan specially in the provincial capital, Quetta. \u201CWhether it was\

  \ in the Alamdar Road and Hazara Town blasts; being a planner he had become a symbol\

  \ Kurd was apprehended once before, but managed to escape from a high security prison.\
  \ He was apprehended by an intelligence agency along with the Sindh CID in December\
  \ 2005 from Cattle colony in Karachi. After his arrest from the metropolis, he was\
  \ shifted to Quetta where he was kept at the Anti Terrorist Force\u2019s high security\
  \ prison inside Quetta Cantonment. Astonishingly in 2008, he escaped from the fortified\
  \ prison and remained at large till Sunday, when he was killed.According to his\
  \ interrogation report, seen by this scribe, Kurd was one of 8 siblings born to\
  \ Noor Mohammad who hailed from a poor background. At the young age of 15, he began\
  \ driving an oil tanker and later joined Dawood Badini another oil tanker driver.\
  \ Badini\u2019s father was Mulana Ameer Hamza Badini, the leader of the proscribed\
  \ Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan \u2013 renamed as Ahle Sunnat Wal Jammat (ASWJ). Badini\
  \ is the nephew of al-Qaeda\u2019s former operational commander and No. 3, Khalid\
  \ Sheikh Mohammad. He is also the brother-in-law of Ramzi Yousaf, who executed the\
  \ first terror attack in the United States in 1993 at the World Trade Center in\
  \ New York. Saifullah Kurd began visiting gatherings hosted by Badini\u2019s father,\
  \ Ameer Hamza and under his influence joined the proscribed Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan.\
  \ In 1998, Saifullah Kurd first met with Riaz Basra, the founder of banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi\
  \ in Kabul, Afghanistan. A recently executed terrorist Shabbir aka Doctor was also\
  \ present during the meeting. It was in Afghanistan that Kurd received 20-days of\
  \ training at the Khalid Bin Waleed training camp run by banned Harkat-ul-Mujahideen,\
  \ where he was trained on how to use pistols and AK-47 assault rifles by his trainer,\
  \ Ustad Usama.Kurd stayed in Afghanistan for a month and returned to Quetta via\

  \ lost his life in the attack. For their direct involvement in terrorist attacks,\

  \ must be choked to end the reign of terror. Situation in North WaziristanBajwa\
  \ explained that the Taliban were using safe havens in North Waziristan to operate,\
  \ they had communication systems, were manufacturing bombs and explosive material\
  \ for their nefarious terror objectives. Border CrossingDue to Pakistan\u2019s porous\
  \ borders, Bajwa said, the Taliban were able to cross over to Afghanistan due to\
  \ their existing links. He added, that ISAF and the Afghan security forces were\
  \ informed well before the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb about the border-crossing\
  \ and in some cases they met with success while in others they are still struggling.\
  \ Khyber AgencyThe DG ISPR explains that the Army went into Khyber Agency to clear\
  \ the area and to sever links that the terrorists were trying to reestablish, adding\
  \ that they met with success due to good cooperation with the Afghan and ISAF forces.\
  \ Bajwa added, that when forces went in, they discovered that the terrorists were\
  \ very well equipped and would have been able to cause great damage. Rehabilitation\
  \ InitiativesBajwa told the think tank, that Pakistan has started various social\
  \ economic development projects within the tribal areas to bring dividends to the\
  \ locals through trade and economic development, adding that a general trade corridor\
  \ has been created to expedite trade.Pakistan is addressing the root causes of the\
  \ problem and is initiating projects in fields of education, rehabilitating schools,\
  \ reviewing the curriculum and enabling young girls to attend schools.Bajwa said,\
  \ Pakistan is grateful to its friends from across the world, the donors who are\
  \ helping our efforts, their help is much appreciated, adding that a comprehensive\
  \ plan is in place to look after the IDP\u2019s and rehabilitate them as soon as\
  \ possible which includes cooperation with all relevant civilian agencies.  Border\
  \ IssuesOn the issue of Pakistan\u2019s porous border, Bajwa explained, that it\
  \ was difficult to seal the Eastern border with Afghanistan and the border with\
  \ Iran, adding that was a big challenge. He added that Pakistan has a 3000 km Eastern\
  \ border with India and others. He shared that Pakistan\u2019s neighbours keep hurling\
  \ allegations. He said border violations from India are distracting Pakistan from\
  \ the task we have on the western side, we have shown lots of restraint. Pakistan\
  \ has been offering peace while India has shown arrogance. They cancelled secretary\
  \ level talks, accused Pakistan wrongly adding that there is a method to their madness.\
  \ They are trying to distract our attention, while we want peace and we have offered\
  \ it many times. He said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has gone to great lengths.\
  \ He met Narendra Modi and our foreign office went out of the way, we offered DG\
  \ level talks. It helped to some extent, but what do you do when there is military\
  \ violation and then they blame Pakistan instead \u2013 that doesn\u2019t help,\
  \ he added. Bajwa said, things are right there for everyone to see adding that Pakistan\
  \ expects everyone to play their role to bring peace. India needs to understand,\
  \ that Pakistan is not oblivious to what is happening in India. There is the festering\
  \ wound of the unresolved issue of Kashmir, it is one of the major issues n the\
  \ way of peace between India and Pakistan. BalochistanOn the issue of Balochistan,\
  \ the DG ISPR explained that it is a national problem and that Pakistan has been\
  \ raising the issue of external interference at every level. He said, the porous\
  \ nature of the border hinders full control of the state adding that Baloch militants\
  \ have links and bases inside Afghanistan where Ferrari camps are present. He explained\
  \ that militancy of this nature cannot sustain without external influence for long\
  \ without financing from abroad and that much of it was taking place as a result\
  \ of foreign help but said he did not want to name any country. Military CourtsOn\
  \ the issue of military courts, Bajwa said, that the entire justice system has not\
  \ come under military domain, explaining that military courts are a stop gap arrangement\
  \ due to the existing capacity issue of Pakistan\u2019s judicial system. He clarified\
  \ that military courts will only deal with terrorists. Madrasa ReformsThe decision\
  \ to reform madrasa\u2019s has been taken against those seminaries that abet and\
  \ facilitate terrorists or those who sympathize with terrorists. He added, that\
  \ warrants against Maulana Aziz (the Lal Masjid cleric) have been issued and that\
  \ it was only a matter of execution now. He said, the government has taken its decision\
  \ against terrorism adding that everything does not happen overnight. The government\
  \ is serious about dealing with anyone who sympathizes with or promotes terrorism\
  \ in any form, he added."

text: "To be part of a world cup squad remains the pinnacle in any player\u2019s career,\
  \ but to miss the berth is an agonizing pain that not only hurts deep inside, but\
  \ keeps resurging for times to come. While most of our favorite stars are trying\
  \ to acclimatize with the punishing Down-Under demands, here is a look at the few\
  \ who would be forced to watch the games on television and mediate over missed chances.\
  \ Readers might not be in total agreement with my selection and would chip in alternatives,\
  \ but I have a strong belief that the players mentioned are still match winners\
  \ on their day. If given a chance they would sweat enough to fit in national shirts.1-\
  \ Alastair Cook2014 wasn't a year Cook would keep in his memory; the former England\
  \ skipper could only manage 523 runs in 20 matches at a mediocre average of 27.52.\
  \ To add salt to his wounds, back to back defeats against India and then Sri-Lanka\
  \ cut loose his arm band. This double jolt of form and luck convinced the selectors\
  \ to put faith in the young and charismatic Eoin Morgan.2-Kamran AkmalThe elder\
  \ Akmal is probably the most interesting player of his times. While most teams would\
  \ gladly offer him the opening slot, handing him the keeper\u2019s gloves needs\
  \ a lion\u2019s heart. He has been missing from ODI action since June 2013 but that\
  \ would be of little concern as he carries bundles of experience tasting Australian\
  \ pitches and modern pacers. Initially part of Pakistan\u2019s 30 member Squad,\
  \ Karman lost his place and popularity to the young and fearless Sarfaraz.3-Kevin\
  \ PietersenProbably the most dominating and explosive cricketer of the modern era,\
  \ the past year has been tough for the fire-eating stroke maker. A poor avg of 29.40\
  \ during the Ashes down under made the selector\u2019s job easy. For a high maintenance\
  \ player like him, even a few low scores are enough to raise questions. Last wearing\
  \ the England shirt in September 2013, KP has been creating havoc in cricket leagues\
  \ around the world and specially the Big Bash.4-Yuvraj SinghThe True \u201CRock-Star\u201D\
  \ of International cricket and a heartthrob to millions, 2015 Would Cup will surely\
  \ miss the beloved Yuvi. The Hero of the previous edition failed to appear in any\
  \ ODI in 2014 and had an average stint in IPL. The lowest point came when Yuvi failed\
  \ to cut into initial 30. Regardless of this rusty performance, Yuvi is one player\
  \ who\u2019s spark shines at the highest level, a ticking bomb that can go off exactly\
  \ when needed. Dhoni\u2019s 11 would definitely miss a match winner in their ranks.5-Fawad\
  \ AlamFawad Alam is undoubted Pakistan\u2019s hidden gem and at the same time, their\
  \ Unsolved puzzle. Forced into oblivion for a good 3 years, Fawad burst into match\
  \ winning performances when given a chance at the Asia Cup. His sparkling come back\
  \ was a huge surprise, big enough only to be matched by his omission from the world\
  \ cup. Milking 345 runs from 8 matches at a healthy avg of 43, Fawad suddenly became\
  \ the darling of the nation. His Vadera looking mustache and sticking-in approach\
  \ fetched back the much needed stability in the waggling middle order. In a batting\
  \ line up that\u2019s always ready to choke, one can only hope that Pakistan made\
  \ the right decision by leaving out their Iron-Wall.6-Dwayne BravoA maverick all\
  \ rounder, Bravo is missing the world cup seat for reasons purely beyond the boundary.\
  \ West Indian players have had a long prevailing payment dispute with their board\
  \ and Bravo; along with Kevin Pollard were the latest to feel the heat. Bravo faced\
  \ the music for leading the revolt and was replaced by former skipper Darren Sammy.7-Ryan\
  \ HarrisHave Australia made a blunder by not picking the blue chip Harris? Only\
  \ time will tell. Nicknamed Rhino for his hulking figure and tear-apart approach,\
  \ Harris makes a formidable opening bowling pair with Mitchell Johnson, one many\
  \ openers would least like to face. Despite some impressive performance, Australian\
  \ selectors\u2019 weren\u2019t convinced that the 35 year olds injury prone body\
  \ would survive the toil of the World Cup. They appeared more interested in handing\
  \ him the ball for the upcoming Ashes.8-James NeeshamNew Zealand stirred a storm\
  \ by dropping James Neesham and picking the long forgotten Gant Elliot. The magnitude\
  \ of this jolt could only be matched with Pakistan\u2019s dragging of Sohail Khan\
  \ from international oblivion. The debate against Nasham raised the fact that his\
  \ best performances came in test matches and his replacement Elliot would bring\
  \ solidity to the batting line.9-Ajantha MendisThe maestro that gave us the mystery\
  \ \u201CCarrom Ball\u201D and is remembered best for tormenting the Indian Team.\
  \ He might not be as effective as the time he emerged, but still remains a lethal\
  \ force in the shorter formats where batsmen don\u2019t have much time to adjust\
  \ to his variations. He is one of the 6 players overlooked by the Islanders for\
  \ the Cup. This cut could eventually mean an end to his illustrious but often up\
  \ and down career.10-Saeed AjmalThe story of Ajmal is the saddest of the Cup. Had\
  \ it not been for the suspected arm action, Ajmal would have been the Hercules for\
  \ Pakistan. Baffled with fitness issues, Ajmal\u2019s emission could stretch the\
  \ cup further away from the Green Shirts. Always a lethal force to reckon with,\
  \ Ajmal has been re-structuring his action ever since English umpire Ian Gould brought\
  \ his action under the microscope.11-Umer GulGul, undoubtedly Pakistan\u2019s most\
  \ experience bowler has been battling with a long aggravating knee injury. Operated\
  \ in May, Gul was recalled for the series against Sri-Lanka where the pain resurfaced\
  \ and turned chronic during the New Zealand series. Gul has maintained that he is\
  \ fit for the highest level, but somehow failed to satisfy the selectors. The architect\
  \ of the 2009 T-20 triumph and countless memorable moments, the world\u2019s best\
  \ dearth bowler will surely be missed.Robin Peterson \u2013 12th Man. It would be\
  \ difficult for Robin Peterson to sit back and watch the happenings from back home,\
  \ having played three world cups, the handy spinner lost his place to Aron Phangiso."

  forms of malnutrition that include under five stunting and anaemia among women during
  the child bearing years.The first ever Global Nutrition Report that tracks the progress
  of 193 member countries of the United Nations in improving their nutrition status
  also identified Pakistan beginning to encounter the problem of adult obesity and
  related matters. The authors of the report launched at the 2nd International Conference
  on Nutrition (ICN2) have also assessed the progress against the six global World
  Health Assembly nutrition targets that include reducing child stunting and wasting
  anaemia in women of reproductive age and low birth weight preventing a worsening
  of child overweight and increasing exclusive breastfeeding of infants.With urban
  transition and changing lifestyles Pakistan is now facing a mixed pattern of malnutrition
  with high rates of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies among poor women
  and children as well as increasing rates of overweight and obesity among adults
  said Dr Zulfiqar Bhutta.The senior pediatrician and one of the authors of the report
  along with his colleagues had examined the impact on stunting and wasting in Bangladesh
  Ethiopia and Pakistan of scaling up coverage of key nutrition specific programmes
  plus interventions related to optimising birth intervals and improving water sanitation
  and hygiene. The results showed that by scaling up key interventions the model estimates
  reductions in the prevalence of stunting of 17 per cent 21 percent and 18 percent
  from 2013 to 2025 in Bangladesh Ethiopia and Pakistan respectively. Predicted reductions
  in the prevalence of severe wasting were estimated at 65 percent 62 percent and
  58 percent respectively.The impacts on severe wasting are particularly noteworthy
  whereas the estimated declines in stunting are modest and signal the need to increase
  both the coverage and quality of these interventions.Prof Zulfiqar Bhutta also the
  founding director of the Centre for Excellence in Women and Child Health at Aga
  Khan University said scientists and public health specialists at AKU are engaged
  in testing and implementing innovations and low cost solutions to address the problems
  of stunting and wasting among infants and children as well as adolescent girls in

  \ anything going in his favour? Absolutely nothing! It was his first World Cup match\

  \ missing the first four matches. Coach Waqar Younis infected more dents by questioning\
  \ his technique and above all, the match was played in the over cast conditions\

  \ out invictus, reliving the true spirit of Imran Khan\u2019s Cornered Tiger, never\
  \ giving up, refusing to go down and fighting till the last breath.This is how we\
  \ know Sarfaraz Ahmed, the Cricket Warrior born and sharpened on the tough and rugged\
  \ streets of Karachi. A proud graduate of Rashid Latif\u2019s School of wicket-keeping\
  \ techniques and mental strength.But for anyone arguing that his performance was\
  \ just a one off spectacular, needs to revisit his battle-hardened attitude in whatever\
  \ little chances that came his way. At the 2012 Asia Cup final in Mirpur, he top\
  \ scored with a commanding 69 ball 46, including the crucial 13 in the final over\
  \ that helped Pakistan overcome a spirited fight from Bangladesh.Being dumped in\
  \ and out like an extra luggage piece, it was the year 2014 that gave Sarfaraz a\
  \ decent run and the Braveheart responded by maturing into a genuine match-winner.\
  \ He is the first Pakistani wicketkeeper to score three hundreds in one year.But\
  \ let\u2019s not forget that he is first a keeper and then anything else. In an\
  \ era when Pakistan Cricket has been hostage to the slips and misses of the Umar\
  \ Akmal Trilogy, its Sarfaraz\u2019s dependable glove work that has proved to be\
  \ a safe haven for Pakistani bowlers.Had he not been replaced, just imagine the\
  \ mess Akmal would have made off Hashim Amla\u2019s nudge.Like countless sad stories\
  \ of dumping and nepotism in Pakistan Cricket, Sarfaraz is no stranger to hardships\
  \ and baseless criticism. Often sidelined for unexplained reasons, the street fighter\
  \ has the habit of crawling his way back through some stellar performances.Some\
  \ circles scared of his skills and leadership qualities have discouraged and deliberately\
  \ tried to keep him out of the team. During a recent tour, his visa was purposely\
  \ delayed and a fellow keeper kept on telling him that he will be replacing Sarfaraz\
  \ on the tour. Sarfaraz eventually went on the tour, though he was dropped soon\
  \ afterwards without given right opportunities.Right after the 2012 Asia Cup, he\
  \ was dubbed as \u201CNot a good enough batsman\u201D and was dropped from the next\
  \ outing.A further shock came with him not being awarded the Central Contract.Expecting\
  \ Better from a CoachLet\u2019s admit it, Sarfaraz proved the Think Tank completely\
  \ wrong. In another setting, the Coach or captain would have erupted with joy and\
  \ shower laurels on his young gun, but remember this is Team Pakistan, where personal\
  \ egos have always been much larger than the game.There was no point in Waqar walking\
  \ alone for the press conference; honestly, he hadn\u2019t done much to deserve\
  \ a chat with the media about this feat (he puts Misbah to the cannons whenever\
  \ the team loses). His only right move was to let Sarfaraz play, but only after\
  \ facing ruthless criticism and shouldering some scratchy performances from his\
  \ beloveds.Rather, it was Sarfaraz\u2019s day, he had earned it. It was he who deserved\
  \ to pose a winning smile for the cameras. It was his feelings and experience that\
  \ were of interest to fans and media scribes around the world. Sadly, he was deprived\
  \ of the opportunity and Waqar engineered an unnecessary controversy.Interestingly,\
  \ Waqar has time and again accused Wasim Akram of sabotaging his carrier. It\u2019\
  s strange to see him handing the same treatment to the young and controversy free\
  \ Sarfaraz. Waqar needs to realise that like a boomerang thrown correctly, a deserving\
  \ player will only bring back the laurels to him.Hopefully, things will change for\
  \ Sarfaraz now.He has shown his toughness and lethality and expectations would be\
  \ high from him, but as the saying goes, \u201CWhen the going gets tough, the tough\
  \ get going\u201D. The fear of failure and being dropped again would keep pushing\
  \ him for more and each winning performance would be a question for his coach, if\

text: 'ISLAMABAD: The chief justice of Pakistan has taken notice of the case of a
  woman, a resident of Rawalpindi, who was trafficked after being abducted.  CJP Justice
  Mian Saqib Nisar has sought a report on the case from the inspector general of police
  in Islamabad and the Punjab government within three days.   The issue was taken
  up after the case was mentioned in a recently published article of The News titled
  ''Women trafficking in twin cities goes unchecked'' and in Daily Jang titled ''Sub
  goongay kiyoon hogaye''. The articles mention the case of a 40-year-old woman, mother
  of three children and resident of Rawalpindi, who was sold to different people,
  eventually reaching Afghanistan, after she was abducted. The abductors demanded
  Rs300,000 to return her, while the police said they could not do anything to expedite
  the pace of progress in the case. The story added a large number of women were sold
  from Pakistan by an organised gang of 150 members who arrange fake marriages of
  these women. Published on January 1, the story stated that FIR of the case was registered
  at Airport Police Station in Rawalpindi, but the filing of the case has so far gone
  in vain as police have been using delaying tactics. The woman''s husband reported
  receiving a phone call from a man in Afghanistan who asked him for Rs300,000 to
  release his wife. He said he would otherwise sell the woman to someone else. Being
  a daily wager, the husband said he could barely feed his children with his earning
  how would he pay such a huge amount for the release of his wife. According to her
  husband, the woman told him she was sold to an aged person in marriage, but when
  she told him she was married and had kids, he returned her to the agent, taking
  his money back. According to her husband, the woman told him she was sold to an
  aged person in marriage, but when she told him she was married and had kids, he
  returned her to the agent, taking his money back. When contacted, the agent told
  The News she came to him on her own will as he had paid her husband Rs50,000.   When
  contacted, the agent told The News she came to him on her own will as he had paid
  her husband Rs50,000.  Moreover, the story read that Khanna Pul, Fauji Colony, Chuhar,
  Kohinoor Mills area in Rawalpindi city are the hub of this gang. Moreover, the story
  read that Khanna Pul, Fauji Colony, Chuhar, Kohinoor Mills area in Rawalpindi city
  are the hub of this gang.  They apparently work under the guise of matchmakers by
  tracking families from low-income backgrounds, promising them to get their daughters
  married and offering a handsome amount as well. Once the parents agree, they sell
  the women either in Afghanistan or within the country. The gang members have sold
  many Pakistani girls in Afghanistan or Afghan girls in Pakistan, by solemnising
  phone nikkah by a registrar, usually the prayer leader of a mosque, on a commission
  of Rs5,000 per nikkah.  An older adult woman, residing in Swabi, runs the gang s
  activities in Afghanistan. She takes the women with her to Jalalabad and sells them
  to Afghan agents. The gang keeps on changing their houses so as not be traced by
  anyone, one of the gang members told The News.     '

text: 'The equation for Pakistan is crystal clear, defeat the South Africans or go
  pack your bags. As the World Cup pool stage approaches its pointy end, both teams
  would look to pocket the all important 2 points, but for different reasons. South
  Africa, for a jab at the top slot, for Pakistan it s a question of survival.While
  fans would love to watch leather bang hard on willow, there are good chances that
  mother nature might step in at Auckland and spoil the fun with possible thundering
  showers.As the big hitters from both sides adjust their grips and the quickies tighten
  their spikes for the cut-through fixture, how about getting a bit nostalgic and
  re-collect some golden moments from days gone by?The Protease and Green shirts have
  fought their battles hard and given fans some memorable treats to cherish. From
  the first time they locked horns at the 92 Cup till the last arm-lock in Centurion,
  it s been all about pure passion, challenge and hunger for success. Keeping such
  history in mind, both teams are expected to produce a lot of bang and smoke on Saturday.Let
  s revisit some moments that refuse to leave our collections.1. Jhonty steals Inzi
  and the three Stumps   Crickets Superman hits the groundWe have all seen it hundreds
  of times and still never get tired of it, probably the most spectacular moment from
  a cricket field. The iconic image of the airborne Jhonty, horizontal to the last
  limb, flying through the air and defying laws of gravity to demolish all three stumps.
  A mind boggling stunt that would make even the legendary Christopher Reeve bite
  his fingers.The magical moment was captured by famed cricket photographer Patrick
  Eager and became a part of the games folklore. Jhonty recognition before the run
  out was limited to that of a struggling middle order batsman who wasn t contributing
  enough runs but would save 20 odd runs in fielding. But that one picture changed
  his existence.Ask him today and Jhonty is still unsure if it was his leap against
  gravity or the click of the camera that made him the poster boy of World Cricket.2.
  Waqar Younis 4-62 at Sharjah Cup Final   The return of the wounded TigerWhat a match
  for fans, what a match for Pakistan and what a match for Waqar Younis it was. Being
  thrashed by Australia in the tour Down under, Wasim Akram was dethroned from Captaincy
  and Pakistan came to play the Sharjah Cup under a new leader, Moin Khan.Waqar was
  kept on the side lines by Wasim and it was his time to hit back. Although he had
  a rocking tournament, but the Burewala Express kept his best for the finals against
  the mighty South Africans. Defending a total of 263, Waqar s middle order burst
  kept a check on the Protease and gave Moin Khan his first tournament win as a captain.And
  not to forget from the same match was Inzaman s cracking off drive that nearly blew
  Nantie Haywards head.3. Afridi s Flying Kiss to Jacque Kallis   Kallis Chaumma DedeAs
  the old saying goes, you can expect anything from Shahid Afridi, but here was an
  act as bizarre as it can get. It was the Semifinal of the T-20 WC at Nottingham,
  Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat. The last ball of the 4th over, Afridi
  wacked a short one from Kallis over wide midwicket for four.It was one of the hundreds
  of boundaries Afridi struck in his career, but what he did next caught every one
  off guard and astonished Kallis. Out of the blue, Afridi blew him a kiss but Kallis
  wasn t thrilled. This was tempting food for TV channels who did not miss a chance
  to milk out ratings. The foot tapping Amitabh hit  Jumma Chaumma Dede  blended perfectly
  and also generated thousand of hits on YouTube.4. Abdul Razzaq s rampant century
  at Abu DhabiPakistan had lost the first match and badly needed a win to bounce back
  in the series. Same was the case with Razzaq who was ping ponged in and out of the
  team. Chasing a target of 286, Pakistan were bruised at 5-136 when Razzaq took guard.
  It was the perfect setting for Razzaq who grabbed the opportunity with both hands
  and showered a 72 ball 109 that included 10 sixes and 7 fours. In his own words,
  this was the most memorable and fighting innings he ever played.5.Fanie de Villiers
  Cycling joy and Hansie Cronje s Tanga jockey funWe have all seem them; we have all
  lived through them. Pakistan has seen much better days then the ones currently flashed
  to the world. Foreign teams used to visit Pakistan multiple times every year, they
  used to play hard and rubbishing aside the cultural shock syndrome, used to merge
  and enjoy the tastes of Pakistan s rich and colorful culture. Every time Pakistan
  play their home series in UAE, the images of Fanie de Villiers enjoying his cycle
  ride in Faisalabad s Famous  Ghanta Ghar Chowk , or the Late Hansie Cronje hacking
  the Tanga at Rawalpindi s  Raja Bazar , remind of the golden days of Pakistan Cricket.
  The smile of their faces tells the complete story, how secure and welcomed they
  felt in the land of pure.Only South Africa can fell Pakistan s pain, they themselves
  suffered international isolation for 27 years and went through the painful apartheid
  segregation. Only they can realize the agony behind empty stands and dusty grounds.
  They have helped us before, they could again stretch their hands and allow Pakistani
  fans to make some noise in those empty stands.                                                         '

  \ N.H:\_Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders coasted to victory on\
  \ a wave of voter anger in the New Hampshire presidential nominating contest, thrashing\
  \ traditional U.S. politicians in a display of anti-establishment power.\nSweeping\
  \ wins by Trump, a New York billionaire, and Sanders, a democratic socialist, on\
  \ Tuesday testified to the sizable share of American voters upset at U.S. economic\
  \ conditions and willing to send a shockwave to Washington in the Nov. 8 presidential\
  \ election.\nNew Hampshire's verdict sets up a tough fight for Republicans in South\
  \ Carolina on Feb. 20 and for Democrats there on Feb. 27. Some of the most monumental\
  \ campaign battles in elections past have been fought in the state that holds the\
  \ first primary election of the American South.\nFor Trump, New Hampshire showed\
  \ he has staying power and can take a punch after losing on Feb. 1 to Texas Senator\
  \ Ted Cruz in the first contest, the Iowa caucuses. His win showed pundits were\
  \ wrong to think he would ultimately self-destruct based on his penchant for insults\
  \ and imprecise plans for the presidency.\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton, the former\
  \ U.S. secretary of state and former U.S. senator, now looks wounded, trailing Sanders\
  \ by 60 to 39 percent based on 86 percent of the returns.The wife of former President\
  \ Bill Clinton, Clinton barely won Iowa and now has been trounced in New Hampshire,\
  \ where young voters liked Sanders' populist proposals to break up big banks and\
  \ have the government pay for free college tuition.\n\u201CPeople have every right\
  \ to be angry but they\u2019re also hungry, they\u2019re hungry for solutions,\u201D\
  \ Clinton, 68, said after congratulating the 74-year-old Sanders. \"I will work\
  \ harder than anyone to actually make the changes that make your lives better.\"\
  \nClinton was headed to New York, home to her campaign headquarters, to regroup\
  \ with top aides and prepare for Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate. Her campaign\
  \ has denied reports it is considering a shakeup but acknowledged it would be natural\
  \ to add members to their team as the campaign progresses.\nSanders said his victory\
  \ showed \"we have sent the message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington,\
  \ from Maine to California, and that is that the government of our great country\
  \ belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\"\
  \nSome 73 percent of voters say they think the United States is on the wrong track,\
  \ and these disaffected people make up a majority of the support bases for Trump\
  \ and Sanders, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nThey are worried about the economy\
  \ and distrust establishment politicians they perceive as being part of the problem.\n\
  SHADOW-BOXING TRUMP\nTrump, 69, who has campaigned to deport illegal immigrants\
  \ and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States, was in first place\
  \ with 35 percent of the vote on the Republican side based on 88 percent of returns.\n\
  At his victory rally, Trump dispensed with niceties. He congratulated other candidates\
  \ in the race but promised to soon return to his pugnacious approach.\n\"Tomorrow:\
  \ boom, boom,\" he said, shadow boxing while his supporters cheered.\nThe New Hampshire\
  \ Republican race did little to clear up confusion about who would emerge as the\
  \ establishment contender to Trump on the Republican side.\nOhio's Republican governor,\
  \ John Kasich, won a spirited fight for second place in New Hampshire, with Cruz,\
  \ former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida fighting\
  \ for third place. All four were headed to South Carolina.\nBush, the son and brother\
  \ of former presidents, lived to fight another day, making something of a comeback\
  \ after a strong debate performance and solid weekend of campaigning.\n\u201CWhile\
  \ the reality TV star is doing well, it looks like you all have reset the race,\"\
  \ Bush told supporters. \"This campaign is not dead. We're going on to South Carolina.\"\
  \nRubio failed to dispatch Bush, seeing a drop in his support after a debate on\
  \ Saturday in which he drew criticism for repeating rehearsed lines from his stump\
  \ speech.\n\"I did not do well on Saturday night - listen to this: that will never\
  \ happen again,\" Rubio told supporters.\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who\
  \ called out Rubio for his robotic debate, fell behind the others in the voting\
  \ and canceled plans to go to South Carolina, a sign he could drop out soon.\nDISENCHANTED\
  \ VOTERS\nIndependent voters wield special clout in New Hampshire, second in the\
  \ series of state-by-state contests that lead to the parties' formal presidential\
  \ nominating conventions in July, because they can vote in either party's primary.\n\
  At a polling station in Manchester, Joan and Roland Martineau said they voted for\
  \ the two candidates they believed they could trust to shake things up.\nJoan, 68,\
  \ went for Sanders. \u201CI like this views, I like the way he speaks, I think I\
  \ can trust him,\u201D she said.\nRoland, 73, a registered Republican, went for\
  \ Trump, a man he said was \"more honest\" than other candidates. But he said he\
  \ would back Sanders over Trump in the general election in November.\nClinton had\
  \ for months been the front-runner nationally. But a Reuters/Ipsos poll done Feb\
  \ 2-5 showed Clinton and Sanders now in a dead heat.\nClinton campaign manager Robby\
  \ Mook said in a memo that the Democratic nomination would \"very likely\" be decided\
  \ in March, with the support of black and Hispanic voters key to victory. The next\
  \ primary races are in Nevada and South Carolina later this month.\n\"It will be\
  \ very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without\
  \ strong levels of support among African-American and Hispanic voters,\" Mook wrote."

text: "Facebook likely be the publisher of everything, says Prof Craig Duff\nThe News\
  \ International got an opportunity to have a Q & A with Prof Craig Duff - an award-winning\
  \ video journalist and television documentary director, producer and writer, specializing\
  \ in multi-platform storytelling and solo journalism.\nDuff was the director of\
  \ multimedia and chief video journalist for TIME, where he oversaw video and other\
  \ multimedia projects for the magazine\u2019s digital platforms and TIME.com.\n\
  He is the focal person on a US-funded project to establish a journalism school at\
  \ the IBA in partnership with Medill and the ICFJ.What prospects moved Medill to\
  \ partner with a Pakistani institution to establish a world class journalism institute?\
  \ How did you become part of it?\nDr. Lawrence Pintak, who is founding dean of \u201C\
  The Edward R. Murrow College of Communication\u201D at Washington State University\
  \ was based in Cairo some years ago running a centre very similar to what we\u2019\
  re building here called the \u201CKamal Adham Center for Journalism Training and\
  \ Research\u201D at The American University. Larry worked to sort out and gauge\
  \ the needs and interests of journalists and editors and media corporations here,\
  \ and what the issues are and what was needed for training under a US funded project\
  \ for establishing a journalism school. Then we bid on the project and were chosen\
  \ for the grant. So I knew that was happening and when the ICFJ wanted to bid on\
  \ it they needed to find a partner school so they called me because I knew everybody\
  \ basically in the whole chain. I had worked with Larry in Cairo at the Adham Centre,\
  \ and I got involved in this because I know the people who wrote the proposal for\
  \ the US government.\nWhat\u2019s the structure of CEJ-Medill partnership; can we\
  \ say that CEJ would be a replica of Medill?\nWe are really trying to create something\
  \ more permanent so our people won\u2019t be involved and we\u2019re going to help\
  \ train people who will carry it forward. So we\u2019re hoping that some people\
  \ will come through our programme in Chicago after that we\u2019ll train those folks\
  \ and they\u2019ll come and be the faculty.\nYou have conducted a successful training\
  \ session with local journalists; what\u2019s your observation?\nMy only experience\
  \ was the two-week \u201CBackpack/Mobile Multimedia Training\u201D course back in\
  \ October 2014 and I think this was the most rewarding international training experience\
  \ I\u2019ve ever had. Everyone who has come back from teaching here has had an extraordinary\
  \ experience and the key things they say are the eagerness among the people who\
  \ are attending to learn, to think differently about journalism. Our impact is only\
  \ measured by what happens once we leave if people apply what they\u2019ve learned\
  \ and started doing it. And it\u2019s great when you see that happening. The institute\
  \ is going to have the facility that will have a working studio and editing facilities\
  \ so they\u2019ll be able to train pretty much any technology here.\nWhat are the\
  \ dos and don\u2019ts for a journalist?\nIn television we don\u2019t set anything\
  \ up, you don\u2019t ask someone to repeat something so you can get a shot of it;\
  \ when you try to be in a place where things are happening and you get the shot\
  \ but you don\u2019t say \u2018could you fire that rifle again please so I can get\
  \ a better shot or I can get a better angle\u2019. We try not to stage things. But\
  \ that is pretty common in TV here.You have to be honest with your audience.\nHow\
  \ do you think electronic media has impacted the print media?\nNow, the newspaper\
  \ has to figure out ways to serve their readers what they\u2019ve already heard\
  \ the news on TV. They have to think of different ways of telling stories and giving\
  \ something else, something extra - an analysis or a context to the story.\nYou\
  \ arranged a student exchange program last year, how do you think such exchanges\
  \ are going to bring professionals closer?\nI think any time two people from two\
  \ cultures get together and work together you are going to have something interesting\
  \ happen and people will learn from each other. That\u2019s always good.\nIn today\u2019\
  s world, technology is changing the way we consume media; where are we heading?\n\
  Just look at the amount of change that has happened over your lifetime in terms\
  \ of how things were produced. It is extraordinary for me to think that I can shoot\
  \ something on mobile, edit it and bring it on my laptop. Pace of things happening\
  \ is so much faster in the past two years that who is to say that in five years\
  \ what we will be doing.\nRight now the big emphasis in news has really been about\
  \ this (mobile) device, not necessarily to record news but to play it or to view\
  \ it. And mobile is basically is how a lot of us in the west are getting our news\
  \ now \u2013 we are all getting hunched now sort of watching this thing all the\
  \ time. So social media is driving it, so that is a huge change in the past few\
  \ years as away from the web to mobile and now mobile is the big focus. Who is to\
  \ say what is going to happen next? It\u2019s probably going to be something portable\
  \ and something very easy for someone to see \u2013 but it has changed our habits\
  \ of how we consume news. I would say the web page homepage doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ anymore for the New York Times or Times magazine because no one goes there, Facebook\
  \ is the new homepage. Earlier, journalists acted as watchdog and decide what should\
  \ masses know but now with growing influence of reader\u2019s feedback we are witnessing\
  \ a reverse trend and journalists now focus on what people want to read\nIt\u2019\
  s sort of a double-edged sword because it is great to have feedback and you understand\
  \ where the viewers are reading by their comments. I think the watchdog role (of\
  \ media) is the very bedrock of journalism that we are there to serve a purpose\
  \ to keep those in power from doing crazy things or to at least make sure that there\
  \ is a check on power and it\u2019s a vital role.\nSocial media companies are taking\
  \ over the publisher\u2019s space and business too, how it\u2019s going to affect\
  \ media outlets?\nFacebook I think will like to be the publisher of everything and\
  \ be the only source of where people get stuff. So software companies are trying\
  \ to become the new publishers and they have a lot of power as they have the audience.\
  \ They\u2019ve already got partnerships with NY Times and National Geographic and\
  \ some others to publish directly. And we\u2019ll see where that goes. The thing\
  \ is that Facebook is only 12 years old who is to say in five years this is going\
  \ to be the biggest technology or software or whatever company surges ahead of them.\n\

  \           KARACHI: As independent scientists, environmentalists and civil society\
  \ organizations continue their campaign to oppose Pakistan\u2019s decision to build\
  \ two more nuclear reactors in Karachi, scientists, engineers and management at\
  \ Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) insist that the country\u2019s move is the\
  \ most viable option to generate clean energy to overcome its lingering power crisis.Pakistan\
  \ is building two more nuclear reactors of 1100 megawatt each at Karachi coast in\
  \ collaboration with China to overcome crippling energy crisis. The twin plants\
  \ are scheduled to generate 2200 megawatt electricity within next five-six years.During\
  \ a visit to country\u2019s first nuclear facility, the KANUPP and site of K2 and\
  \ K3, reporters were briefed on the safety measures as well as its prospects as\
  \ viable and effective contributor to power generation.Afzar Minhaj, general manager\
  \ of KANNUP, said Pakistan has saved millions of dollars in oil export bills due\
  \ to power generations at country\u2019s nuclear reactors.A detailed presentation\
  \ during the briefing argued: \u201CThe nuclear energy is only affordable mature\
  \ option for clean energy. Karachi that too is faced with acute power shortage has\
  \ to contribute in energy generation rather to remain dependent. K-2 and K-3 projects\
  \ will provide clean energy, overcoming the power shortage and leaving minimum impact\
  \ on environment\u201D.To a question as to why the country can\u2019t rely on solar,\
  \ wind and hydro options for power generation, the authorities believed that Karachi\
  \ is not the best place to take advantage of these alternatives.\u201CYou need 500\
  \ acres land to establish a solar energy plant of 100 megawatt while K-2 and K-3\
  \ that will generate 2200 megawatt energy are being built on 585 acres. This space\
  \ is enough to set up more such plants,\u201D said Azfar Minhaj.\u201DHe said the\
  \ hydro power generation, though environment friendly, has certain issues as well\
  \ and so is the case with solar power.Discussing public perception on nuclear disasters,\
  \ he said concerns about radiation related emergencies in power plants originally\
  \ emanate from World War II nuclear attacks on Japan.Citing different reports from\
  \ international organizations on nuclear accidents, he said more deaths were caused\
  \ by evacuation than radioactivity in Japan\u2019s Fukushima disaster that was caused\
  \ by a tsunami in 2011. \u201CNot a single death was caused due to radioactivity\
  \ in Three Miles Island fiasco despite core meltdown while 28 deaths were caused\
  \ by Chernobyl accident due to radioactivity.\u201D\u201CWe have built our plants\
  \ 12 meter above sea level after conducting a seismic survey based on past Tsunami\
  \ that hit Karachi cost in 1945. The solid structure and strict safety measures\
  \ at KNUPP completely rule out the doomsday scenario where power plants are destroyed\
  \ but Karachi survives.\u201DA senior official said mock evacuations and other such\
  \ exercises were also undertaken in adjacent areas as part of a contingency plan\
  \ to cope up with emergencies. Apart from that, he said 10 detectors have also been\
  \ installed in 10 different areas of the city that gauge the radioactivity. Some\
  \ areas including Sadder, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Orangi Town, Federal B Area, North Karachi,\
  \ Drig Colony, KANUPP Colony, Abdul Rehman Goth and Faqeer Muhammad Goth were also\
  \ under KANNUP surveillance.The KANNUP has also setup a Desalination Demonstration\
  \ Plant in its premises that has been catering its needs for drinking and other\
  \ purposes since 2010. A senior official said the plant at KANNUP is producing 400,000\
  \ gallons water per day that not only meets its own needs, but \u201Cwe are also\
  \ supplying it to nearby villages through tankers\u201D.The KANNUP is also making\
  \ efforts to address health issues of the people living in nearby villages through\
  \ sending mobile nursing units. \u201CWe have frequently arranged gatherings with\
  \ elders of nearby Goths to resolve their issues that they share with us,\u201D\
  \ he said.All in all, with more and more countries embarking on plans to lay their\
  \ hands on civil nuclear technology, it seems Islamabad too is not ready to miss\
  \ out on its socioeconomic development. It appears determined to go ahead with its\
  \ civil nuclear program to overcome power crisis that has crippled the country\u2019\
  s economy."

  \ have today chosen hope over fear and unity over division,\u201D he added.\nThe\

  \ \u2013 Jemima Goldsmith\u2019s younger brother.\nIn an interview with Hamid Hamid\
  \ on Geo News, Imran Khan said that he was proud to support Zac Goldsmith because\
  \ he originally urged him to enter politics. The PTI leader then expressed his support\
  \ for Zac Goldsmith on 23rd of March on Twitter. Imran Khan told his followers:\
  \ \u201CZac Goldsmith is running for Mayor of London. Have known him for 20 years.\
  \ He is an honourable man with strong convictions and compassion. Zac is a man of\
  \ integrity with a commitment to justice. He has the leadership capabilities to\

  \ always praised Imran Khan and told Geo News in an interview that \u201CImran Khan\
  \ is the answer to Pakistan\u2019s problem\u201D. He said that he considered himself\
  \ \u201Chalf Pakistani\u201D but then he went on to run a nasty campaign associating\

  \ and party chair Sayeeda Warsi said that Zac Goldsmith had become unrecognisable\
  \ to her and that his campaign team was \u201Cdestroying\u201D him through attacks\
  \ on Muslims.\nSadiq Khan told this scribe that he will be a mayor of all lonoders\
  \ and will serve diligently. he said that he will use his tenure to try to improve\
  \ trade relations between pakistan and the UK.\nMillions of Pounds were spent by\
  \ the Tory campaign on telling voters that Sadiq Khan was a Pakistani, Muslim, terror\

  \ BBC: \"I mentioned that I thought this was a mistake for future integration in\
  \ London. I don't think it was dog whistle because you can't hear a dog whistle\
  \ - everybody could hear this.\nIt was effectively saying that people of conservative\
  \ religious views are not to be trusted and you shouldn't share a platform with\
  \ them. That's outrageous.\"\nSadiq Khan has previously said he had \"never hidden\"\
  \ the fact that, as a former chairman of Liberty and a human rights lawyer, he had\
  \ acted for \"some pretty unsavoury characters\".\nMr Boff said the party had actively\
  \ engaged with the Muslim community in Newham, but \"now those bridges that have\
  \ been built, a few of them have been blown up by this campaign\"."

text: "Sarfraz Merchant refuses to appear before FIA on March 15\nLONDON: Sarfraz\
  \ Merchant, one of the central characters in the MQM-related money-laundering investigation,\
  \ has told the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) investigators that he will be\
  \ unable to appear before it on March 15 to record his statement until the FIA does\
  \ not set its record straight and puts the whole context of the investigation right.\n\
  Merchant set the record straight by telling the FIA that he did not originally accuse\
  \ the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) or its leader Altaf Hussain of receiving money\
  \ from the RAW, India\u2019s main spy agency, but the Scotland Yard, showing proofs.\n\
  Sarfraz Merchant said he has undeniable proofs with him showing that the MQM took\
  \ money from the Indian sources and he indicated that he will cooperate with the\
  \ FIA once amends have been made to the summon, record set straight and inappropriate\
  \ language and threat of punishment withdrawn.\nSarfraz Merchant elaborated that\
  \ it was the Scotland Yard that originally said that the MQM took money from the\
  \ Indian government sources. He said it\u2019s a matter of record that the MQM leaders\
  \ including M Anwar and Tariq Mir accepted before the Scotland Yard investigators\
  \ that they received money from India for several years \u2013 in tune of millions\
  \ of Pounds.\nMerchant said that he came to know about the evidence of the MQM involvement\
  \ with the RAW during his recorded interview with the police in London when he saw\
  \ the shocking evidence when the police investigators revealed it to him. Merchant\
  \ said that he is aware -\_ and has proofs \u2013 that the MQM took money from RAW\
  \ but he was not alone in saying that but the Scotland Yard has said it in writing\
  \ too.\nMerchant said that his only issue is with the FIA letter \u201Cthe way it\
  \ has been presented and written\u201D. He said MQM\u2019s involvement with the\
  \ RAW is a serious matter and must be dealt at the highest level.\nThis correspondent\
  \ has obtained a copy of the hard-hitting letter written by Mr Sarfraz Merchant\
  \ in response to the hurriedly written summon issued by the Federal Investigation\
  \ Agency (FIA) to Sarfraz Merchant, urging him to appear before the committee mandated\
  \ to investigate the alleged links of the MQM with the RAW.\nThe FIA was forced\
  \ into action after Sarfraz Merchant said in a world exclusive with Geo News\u2019\
  \ flagship current affairs show \u2018Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath\u2019 that\
  \ he had been asked by the Scotland Yard investigators during recorded interviews\
  \ if he was aware that the MQM was in the pay of the Indian government sources.\n\
  Sarfraz Merchant said that he had not \u201Clevelled any allegation on any political\
  \ party or its leadership\u201D. He told the FIA that his interview on Geo News\
  \ was \u201Cin connection with a leaked document pertaining to a criminal inquiry\
  \ pending in the United Kingdom\u201D \u2013 i.e., money-laundering investigation\
  \ under the Proceeds of Crimes Act involving Altaf Hussain, M Anwar, Tariq Mir,\
  \ Sarfraz Merchant and two others.\n\u201CI had given my views on the contents of\
  \ that document and some observations of the concerned law enforcement agency of\
  \ UK Scotland Yard, which were brought to my notice being a party to the case during\
  \ my under caution interview on 15th of April,2015. It is therefore incorrect to\
  \ suggest that I have alleged something on a political party,\u201D stressed Sarfraz\
  \ Merchant, while explaining that it was not him but the Scotland Yard which believed\
  \ that the MQM received money from the Indian govt in violation of the UK as well\
  \ as Pakistani electoral laws.\nSarfraz Merchant told the FIA bosses that allegations\
  \ about MQM\u2019s links with RAW emerged first in June last year and he wondered\
  \ what took Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s government so long to come into action\
  \ when the nature of the allegations is of shocking and scandalous nature concerning\
  \ directly to the security of Pakistan. Merchant said that the \u201Csubject matter\
  \ of the criminal investigation in the UK is known to all and has been frequently\
  \ discussed in the media and there is no confusion that the issue is directly related\
  \ to the security of Pakistan\u201D.\nIssuing a hard-hitting critique of the very\
  \ poor handing of the case by the government of Pakistan, Merchant said in the letter:\
  \ \u201CI am surprised to learn that you have initiated action at such a belated\
  \ stage. It would have been proper to contact UK authorities more than a year ago\
  \ for mutual assistance and simultaneous initiation of proceedings in Pakistan;\
  \ unfortunately this was not done.\u201D\nSarfraz Merchant expressed his \u201C\
  disappointment on the language and text of your letter which appears to be an attempt\
  \ to intimidate and pressurize me by indicating criminal action against me and also\
  \ placing the entire onus of the case on my shoulders\u201D. Chaudhary Nisar Ali\
  \ Khan had requested Sarfraz Merchant to assist the FIA in its inquiry but the FIA\
  \ issued a threatening summon to Sarfraz Merchant.\nSarfraz Merchant took exception\
  \ to the fact that the FIA summon was signed off by the Commercial Banking Circle.\_\
  \ Merchant said he believed that \u201Cmatters of national security are required\
  \ to be handled more professionally and not as a typical case of Commercial Banking\
  \ Circle\u201D.\nSarfraz Merchant explained that he was a \u201Cresponsible and\
  \ patriotic citizen\u201D of Pakistan and he felt \u201Cobliged to render complete\
  \ assistance in a matter involving security and integrity of the country in accordance\
  \ with law, however the manner in which the case is being handled especially the\
  \ manner in which summon has been issued reflects that importance and gravity of\
  \ the issue has not been understood by your agency\u201D.\nSarfraz Merchant concluded:\
  \ \u201CUnder such circumstances I will not be able to appear on the 15th of March,\
  \ 2016 for giving my statement until the format/contents of your un-dated letter\
  \ delivered to me by DHL and through Pakistan High Commission, London through Post\
  \ received on 11/03/2016 and 12/03/2016 are corrected referred in Paragraph No 3\
  \ of this letter\u201D."

  \nBEIJING: The Chinese government has granted the status of \"Guest of Honor\" to\
  \ Pakistan at the China International Import Expo (CIIE) to be held from November\
  \ 5 to 10. This will ensure the provision of all possible facilities and benefits\
  \ to the Pakistani pavilion.The gesture also shows the level of commitment in China\
  \ to make Pakistan part of a shared future, according to an article published by\
  \ Global Times here on Monday.The expo offers a chance for global manufacturers\
  \ and producers to showcase their products in order to gain access to China's market.The\
  \ expo is also an opening for countries participating in the Belt and Road (B&R)\
  \ initiative to boost their infrastructure upgrading and reach wider markets.Pakistan\
  \ is one such country, which is undergoing massive infrastructure development to\
  \ align itself with global transportation and communication networks.The China-Pakistan\
  \ Economic Corridor (CPEC) will create an advanced network of roads, railways and\
  \ a deep-sea port that will boost trade with China, Central Asia and Europe.China\u2019\
  s demand for imported food has been growing steadily, creating a market worth $58.28\
  \ billion last year, a 25 percent increase year-on-year.Pakistan, on the other hand,\
  \ has a largely agrarian economy.With the help of Chinese scientists, local agriculture\
  \ specialists have successfully introduced modern farming techniques.Hybrid rice\
  \ and hybrid wheat have been the most successful products, seeing a marked increase\
  \ in yield.Meanwhile, Pakistani mangoes are also doing well; 10,000 tons of them\
  \ are expected to be exported to China by the end of this year.To take advantage\
  \ of China''s food market, Pakistani producers at the CIIE can offer their own unique\
  \ and cost-effective products.A bigger share of the market in China would translate\
  \ into higher revenues, improved quality and a wider product range.Apart from food,\
  \ there are other Pakistani products with immense potential for export to China,\
  \ including onyx stones, minerals and surgical items.The expo organizers were initially\
  \ expecting around 150,000 purchasing agents, but they have so far registered over\
  \ 160,000. This massive participation will present Pakistan with access to markets\
  \ in other countries as well.As foreign buyers experience the previously unexplored\
  \ Pakistani prospects, new windows of trade will open.Thus, Pakistani businesses\
  \ will expand not just into China, but also internationally.Starting from the port\
  \ of Shanghai, China is rolling out assistance for B&R countries to bring down their\
  \ trade costs.The cargo clearance process has been simplified and a new filing mechanism\
  \ is being built for the CIIE pavilions of these countries.China is also adjusting\
  \ tariffs on certain products, such as nuts from Pakistan, in order to meet the\
  \ demand among domestic consumers.As a follow-up step to the import expo, Pakistani\
  \ manufacturers can take advantage of China's booming e-commerce sector.They can\
  \ utilize this highly developed industry to reach out to more customers than would\
  \ be possible only with physical stores in China.Alibaba Group has acquired Pakistan's\
  \ largest e-commerce portal and its payment arm Alipay is planning to enter the\
  \ Pakistani market this year.These ventures will help local manufacturers export\
  \ goods to China while letting the supply chain infrastructure, which is already\
  \ maturing under the CPEC and B&R initiative, do its job.Pakistan and China are\
  \ developing stronger ties in the rapidly evolving global order."

  \ radical and a threat to Britain\u2019s national security.\u2019 Zac Goldsmith\u2019\
  s attack on sadiq Khan was so racist and Islamophobic that former Tory cabinet minister\

  \ Jews, Sikhs or Hindus, Buddhists or atheists, I'll still be your mayor.\u201D\n\
  Sadiq Khan accepted that the fight for the second most important job in Britain\
  \ was very tough. He said that his parents taught him how to fight for values and\

  \ religion Islam is. This was my thinking. I am proud of who I am and I have every\
  \ reason to take pride in my being and my values.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that he\
  \ was supported by people of all faiths and people of no faith. \u201CMy victory\
  \ is everyone's victory. The support I received in the shape of campaigning, finance\
  \ and prayers was absolutely fantastic. And we showed the world that London is the\
  \ best city in the world,\u201D he added.\nSadiq Khan told Geo News that he was\
  \ aware that his victory was celebrated across Pakistan and people prayed for his\
  \ victory and held celebrations when he was declared a victor.\n\u201CI received\
  \ messages from friends and supporters about the pride that was felt in Pakistan.\
  \ My parents, grandparents are from Pakistan, my family is still there so I feel\
  \ proud, I feel humbled, and this is a responsibility to show London that a man\
  \ from an Islamic background and Pakistani heritage can help business, can build\
  \ the homes, can fix the transport.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that Tory election campaign\
  \ was negative and counter-productive and it was clear that the Lonodoners rejected\
  \ their message of division and hatred.\n\u201CThe Conservative campaign was extremely\
  \ negative, divisive and desperate. People were doubted about whether it is possible\
  \ for London to choose a mayor and have security around other issues. The support\
  \ we received was fantastic. The biggest ever turnout in election, the biggest vote\
  \ to the winning candidate and we've shown the world that we're the best city in\
  \ the world. And I thank all your viewers (of Geo News) for the best wishes after\
  \ elections. I received lots of messages after May 5. I am deeply thankful to all\
  \ those people. I am very busy at the moment and I can\u2019t thank everyone in\
  \ person but I know their sentiments and value them.\u201D\nSadiq Khan said that\
  \ it was a sad fact that the \u201Creputation of our religion Islam is not good\
  \ these days\u201D. He said many people in the world think that all Muslims are\
  \ terrorists and extremists. \u201CSo if we can show them that we're peaceful, law-abiding\
  \ and that we're capable of keeping everyone safe, then the reputation of Islam\
  \ will improve.\u201D\nKhan has said he is not a Muslim leader, not a spokesperson\
  \ of Islam and not the representative of Muslims but he had made it clear that he\u2019\
  s a practicing Muslim and observes Ramazan.\nHe told Geo News that fasting for 19\
  \ hours a day in the UK is not an easy task especially when there\u2019s a round\
  \ the clock job to do at the City Hall but he said that Islam is all about making\
  \ sacrifices and overcoming the self, for others.\n\u201CIt is difficult to fast\
  \ for 19 hours. I engage in a lot of speeches, media, TV and public debating. Fasting\
  \ is a sacrifice and this is a month of charity. And this is my humility. I know\
  \ a lot of people in London are hungry. 100,000 people last year used a food bank.\
  \ So fasting allows me to have solidarity with these hungry, poor people.\n\u201C\
  There is a reason fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. If you're a Muslim,\
  \ and you can fast, then that's great. Another positive thing is that non-Muslims\
  \ are now learning about Islam, about fasting. They ask me \u201Chow are you doing\
  \ this? How is the fasting going?\" I think this is a good thing that they're beginning\
  \ to understand our religion.\u201D\n\u2018Ignorant Trump needs to understand Islam\u2019\
  \nSadiq Khan condemned US politician Donald Trump for helping extremist groups such\
  \ as Daesh by announcing a ban on all Muslims from entering the United States.\n\
  \u201CExtremists say that western values and Islam is incompatible \u2013 that you\
  \ cannot be a Muslim if you're western. They're both different. Donald Trump is\
  \ saying the same: that you cannot be western if you're a Muslim. He proposed a\
  \ ban on Muslims from entering USA. After my victory, he announced that he'd make\
  \ an exception for Sadiq Khan.\n\u201CMy answer is this: I am not an exception.\
  \ Why are you making an exception for me? There are law-abiding Muslims in England\
  \ and London and Europe and all around the world who want to go America. They're\
  \ peaceful, they're law-abiding. Donald trump is basically doing ISIS' work for\
  \ them by preaching their message of either Westernism or Islam.\u201D\nThe London\
  \ mayor said that Donald Trump was an ignorant man who needed to broaden his horizons\
  \ and understanding of Islam.\n\u201CI say that Trump is an idiot. He doesn\u2019\
  t understand Islam, and it is our duty to make him understand that this is not what\
  \ Muslims or Islam is about. And in America there are Americans who are Muslims\
  \ working and living peacefully.\u201D\nSadiq Khan outlined his plan of dealing\
  \ with extremism by supporting the police and security agencies in effectively tacking\
  \ with this menace and by rooting out hate preaching. He said that the biggest worry\
  \ was that it needed only one terrorist to succeed in his mission of causing mayhem\
  \ and terror. He said the fact that many young Muslims, including many women, went\
  \ to Syria from the UK to join ISIS, was a worry and must be dealt with.\n\u201C\
  It is a big worry. London is a great city. Intervention has to be more resilient\
  \ to this preaching of hate. There is a motive to close down those websites that\
  \ are encouraging people to go astray. There have been moves to closing down certain\
  \ accounts and stopping things which encourage people to join terror groups. So\
  \ we have a responsibility to ensure that young people aren't led down that path.\u201D\
  \nSadiq Khan last week appeared with Prime Minister David Cameron to show support\
  \ for the \u201CIn\u201D campaign which wants UK to stay in the European Union.\
  \ Only weeks ago the PM had called Sadiq Khan an extremist in the parliament. Observes\
  \ said that it was Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory and his vindication that the British\
  \ premier stood next to him and praised him and his election mandate.\nSadiq Khan\
  \ said he believed that it was in Britain\u2019s interest to stay in the European\
  \ Union and not leave it.\n\u201CWe showed on May 5 how hope and fairness can be\
  \ used to defeat division. Jobs, export market, high street, restaurants, fashion...\
  \ market of USA, China, Japan. We need to think of consequences and remind people\
  \ of the downsides. The benefits are huge.\u201D\n\_"

text: 'Millions risk malnutrition as CO2 levels climb: study


  Paris: Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the air threaten to sap wheat, rice, and
  other staple grains of valuable nutrients, raising the spectre of mass malnutrition,
  researchers warned Monday.On current trends, higher CO2 concentrations could reduce
  iron, zinc and protein levels in the crops that feed the world by up to 17 percent
  by mid-century, they reported in the journal Nature Climate Change."Hundreds of
  millions of people could become newly deficient in these nutrients, primarily in
  Africa, Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East," lead author Matthew Smith, a
  researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told AFP."These are
  in addition to the billions of people already deficient that could see their condition
  worsen."Protein, along with the minerals iron and zinc, are essential nutrients
  for normal human growth and development.Zinc deficiency affects the immune system
  and makes children, particularly, more vulnerable to malaria, lung infections and
  deadly diarrhoeal diseases.A lack of iron increases the likelihood of mothers dying
  during childbirth, can lower IQ, and causes anaemia, or a drop in red blood cells.Wheat,
  rice and maize together account for roughly 40 percent of protein, zinc and iron
  supply in the diet worldwide.In general, humans get three-fifths of dietary protein,
  four-fifths of iron, and 70 percent of zinc requirements from plants.The global
  food system is also vulnerable to rising temperatures, prolonged drought, and other
  forms of extreme weather driven by climate change, earlier research has shown. Impacts
  include reduced crop yields, heat-stressed livestock, and shifts in the quantity
  and location of commercially-fished ocean species.- Unanticipated impacts -To assess
  how extra CO2 in the atmosphere might impact global health by 2050, Smith and colleague
  Samuel Myers ran models for 225 different food plants grown in 151 countries.If
  humanity continues emitting greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil, and natural
  gas at current levels, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is
  likely to reach 550 parts per million (ppm) by 2050.It is now at just over 400 ppm.The
  team found that nearly two percent of the global population -- an extra 175 million
  people -- could become zinc deficient, and 122 million would no longer get enough
  protein under those conditions.Some 1.4 billion women and children under five would
  probably find their iron intake reduced by four percent or more. Half-a-billion
  in this group risk developing iron deficiency-related disease.India would be hardest
  hit, with some 50 million people suffering a lack of zinc, and 38 million falling
  short of minimum protein requirements, said the team.The numbers of affected people
  would also go up dramatically in China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Kenya and
  other emerging or developing economies."Supplements could temporarily alleviate
  some of the health consequences, but they are not a viable long-term solution,"
  said Smith.Because they are difficult to distribute and do not address the underlying
  cause of malnutrition, vitamins and supplements "should best be seen as a short-term
  medical intervention," he added.More than two billion people worldwide are deficient
  in one or more nutrient, according the World Health Organization (WHO).'

text: "Cancer on the rise among children in underprivileged areas of Pakistan\nKarachi:\
  \ An increasing number of cancer cases are being reported among children from low-income\
  \ localities of Pakistan, as per a study conducted by paediatric oncologists at\
  \ the National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Karachi, which cites adverse environmental\
  \ conditions, unhygienic living conditions, consumption of unsafe drinking water\
  \ and malnourishment as possible causes.\_\n\u201CPoor quality of life due to deteriorating\
  \ environmental conditions and unhygienic lifestyle is causing frequent infections\
  \ to a vast majority of Pakistani children. Combined with the malnourishment, these\
  \ infections are resulting in causing various types of cancers to children,\u201D\
  \ said Professor Nizam-ul-Hassan, former director NICH and president of the Child\
  \ Aid Foundation (CAA), a non-profit organisation which runs the cancer treatment\
  \ at the NICH with doctors and philanthropists.\nTalking to The News, he said there\
  \ was no public sector cancer treatment facility in Karachi or even in the entire\
  \ Sindh and Balochistan, and the whole burden of cancer treatment was borne by NGOs\
  \ and associations like the CAA, the Children Cancer Hospital and some other private\
  \ hospitals, including the Aga Khan University Hospital.\nAccording to him, a group\
  \ of Pakistani doctors, including NICH former director Prof Nizamul Hasan, started\
  \ the cancer treatment at the Children Hospital Karachi in April 1999 and since\
  \ then thousands of cancer patients have completely been cured by the qualified\
  \ and trained oncologists and paramedics.\n\u201CAround 50 to 60 children suffering\
  \ from cancers are brought at our OPD everyday, of which 50 percent are new patients.\
  \ Around 300 patients are receiving chemotherapy with various types of cancers,\
  \ including Retinoblastomas, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemias and Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas\u201D\
  , he claimed, adding that the inpatient capacity of the facility was just 14 patients\
  \ due to space constraints.\nWhile quoting pediatric oncologists, he said the worst\
  \ environmental and hygienic conditions at low-income group localities in Pakistan\
  \ were some of the major reasons behind frequent infections, including diarrhea\
  \ and gastroenteritis among children, which was the leading cause of solid tumors\
  \ or blood cancers to them.\nProf Nizam said although the study had yet to be published\
  \ but the observations of the pediatric oncologists led to similar direction, saying\
  \ childhood cancer was on the rise among children of low-income group people, who\
  \ used to live in areas with extremely poor environmental and hygienic conditions,\
  \ having no or low vaccination status and suffered infections on multiple occasions\
  \ in a short span of time.\nTo a query, he said the centre had a team of pediatric\
  \ oncologists, led by Dr Uzma Imam and paramedical staff, who had been trained by\
  \ German pediatric oncologists and paramedics in 2005-06, adding that renowned Pakistani\
  \ pediatric oncologists practicing in US and UK often visit their centre and offered\
  \ their assistance and advice in treatment of patients.\n\u2018Malnourished patients\u2019\
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\n\u201CDuring the last several years, almost 40 percent children brought\
  \ to the NICH with various types of cancers were malnourished and due to low immunity,\
  \ their chances of having cancer increased\u201D, Prof Nizam further said.\nIn addition\
  \ to fighting cancer, he said, doctors and paramedics had to take care of the nutritional\
  \ status of the patients so that their bodies could fight the lethal disease like\
  \ cancers.\nHe further said malnourishment was on the rise among children of low-income\
  \ segments and it was resulting in spreading cancer and other lethal infections.\n\
  \u201CA group of German doctors and nurses, who trained our staff, emphasised on\
  \ improving nutritional status of children with cancers, since a child could not\
  \ fight cancer without having enough nutrition.\u201D\nThe professor said the centre\
  \ was providing highly enriched food supplements in addition to milk and dates to\
  \ cancer patients as most of the patients suffering from cancers were highly fragile\
  \ and underweight due to malnourishment.\n\u2018Eye cancers on the rise\u2019\n\
  Eye cancers, also known as retinoblastomas, are on the rise among Pakistani children\
  \ being brought from rural parts of Sindh, Balochistan and lower Punjab, according\
  \ to Prof Nizam claimed.\nHe said doctors were trying to understand the sudden rise\
  \ in eye cancers which render the patient blind at an early age if not treated at\
  \ the early stages.\nHe said the most common causes of the eye cancers were due\
  \ to genetic reasons, but because of\_ sudden increase in the number of children\
  \ with retinoblastomas, experts at the cancer treatment facility were worried and\
  \ trying to understand the phenomenon.\n\u2018Short of space at centre\u2019\nDespite\
  \ spending Rs600 million annually, the cancer treatment facility at the NICH caters\
  \ to only a few thousand patients annually as only 300 can be given chemotherapy,\
  \ while only 14 can be admitted at the center at a time, according to Prof Nizam\
  \ said.\n\u201CWe are facing a shortage of space due to growing number of patients\
  \ being brought to them from across the country.\n\u201CWe are ready to generate\
  \ double the amount we are spending currently on treatment of children if we are\
  \ provided with ample space to admit more patients. A building at the NICH back\
  \ was supposed to be given to us after its completion, but even after passage of\
  \ a decade, it has not yet been constructed, even after the devolution process\u201D\
  , he said.\nHe urged the provincial government to release funds for the construction\
  \ of the building at the NICH so that more patients with cancers could be treated."

  \   \n\n\n                        KARACHI: There are three kids in town who will\
  \ not yield to forces of evil and darkness that have forced the residents of Roshan\
  \ Basti into submission, unleashing a reign of terror through hired thugs. That\
  \ in short is a plot of Pakistan\u2019s first animated featured film \u201C3 Bahadur\u201D\
  , directed by Oscar winner Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy.Set in a fictional town, the film\
  \ tells the story of three school going children who stand up to Baba Balaam, his\
  \ disciple Mangu and their hired thugs.Having shown their courage in the face of\
  \ tyranny, Amna, Saadi and Kamil are given superpowers before they set out to put\
  \ an end to the injustice that has turned their Roshan Basti into Andher Nagri.Deenu,\
  \ voiced by Behroz Sabzwari, while bestowing superpowers on the three children,\
  \ advises them not to rely merely on their powers but invoke their wisdom as well\
  \ to undo the forces of evil.\u201CYou don\u2019t need to be a superhero. You are\
  \ a superhero,\u201D said Sharmeen Obaid  at the premiere of the film in Nueplex\
  \ Cinemas Karachi.She said: \u201C3 Bahadur is not just a movie. It is a movement.\
  \ We can face the challenges, like the three characters of the film\u201D.The film\
  \ that is slated for countrywide release on May 22, saw a roaring response at the\
  \ premiere that was held Tuesday. Humayun Saeed, Behroz Sabzwari, Saud, Ayesha Umar,\
  \ and many other film and drama stars attended the premiere show.Taciturn Saadi,\
  \ talkative Kamil and courageous Amna have everything to entertain the viewers who\
  \ have yet to watch the first Pakistani animated output.Sharmeen, who won an Academy\
  \ Award for her documentary, Saving Face in 2012 and became the first Pakistani\

text: "Increase in UF gas benchmark challenged in IHC\n                          \
  \  Islamabad Justice Athar Minallah of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) here Wednesday\
  \ issued notices to the respondents after a petitioner challenged the increase in\
  \ unaccounted for gas (UFG) benchmark from 4.5 to 9 per cent that as per petitioner\
  \ will cause huge loss to the public of Pakistan. The petitioner, Farrukh Dall advocate\
  \ has cited federation of Pakistan through secretary cabinet division, ministry\
  \ of  petroleum  and natural  resources, ministry of finance and oil & gas regulatory\
  \ authority (OGRA) as respondents. IHC bench issuing notices to the above said respondents\
  \ also issued notices to the attorney general of Pakistan seeking comments within\
  \ fortnight. The petitioner said that the Constitution of Pakistan is not silent\
  \ on issues which affect economic life of the nation and its citizens. The Constitution\
  \ contains a whole range of articles 3, 4 and 5(2) 9, 14, 18, 23 and 24 which have\
  \ a direct nexus with good economic governance and fundamental rights.   \u201C\
  That the UFG benchmark of 4.5% was fixed by Ogra for Sui Northern Gas Pipelines\
  \ Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) for fiscal year 2011-12 to\
  \ 2014-15 whereas through an illegal decision petroleum ministry and Ogra are trying\
  \ to increase UFG benchmark from 4.5 per cent to 9 per cent on the pretext of non-consumers\
  \ \u2018gas theft, law and order situation and bulk/retail ratio which is illegal/unlawful\
  \ act on their part. This is being done by them despite Prime Minister's deferment\
  \ for change in the gas pricing mechanism that is estimated to increase consumers\
  \ tariff significantly,\u201D he said. The combined impact to the consumers would\
  \ be Rs65-70 billion if the decision is implemented. In fact 4.5 per cent UFG benchmark\
  \ fixed by Ogra in the consumer tariff was meant to reasonably cover the cost of\
  \ pilferage, leakage, loss in security situation and all other difficulties. The\
  \ petitioner argued that petroleum ministry and ECC was not legally empowered to\
  \ issue policy guidelines on UFG and provision of doubt debts in the first place\
  \ as it is a direct jurisdiction of Ogra, which it has been exercising since its\
  \ inception in 2002. The government and regulator are obligated to launch the campaign\
  \ against gas theft rather passing the theft of gas to the consumers. The petitioner\
  \ said that the Supreme Court of Pakistan through a November 25, 2011 judgment had\
  \ shown serious concern  on high  UFG of 11 per cent on SNGPL system and 9.5 per\
  \ cent on SSGCL system and  also referred the matter of increasing UFG benchmark\
  \ from 5 per cent to 7 per cent  for year 2009-2010 to NAB for investigation. The\
  \ petitioner further argued that rectification of gas leakages is the core responsibility\
  \ of the company to which any negligence is not entertainable as gas leakages are\
  \ clearly as controllable factor. Theft of gas has contributed towards increase\
  \ of UFG but the same should have been curtailed after the promulgation of Criminal\
  \ Amendment Act, 2011.  The petitioner has prayed to the IHC to declare the increase\
  \ in UFG illegal and unlawful."

text: "NA-123 faces civic problems, upsurge in crime\n                           \
  \ LAHORESLACKNESS on part of civic bodies as well as police has added to the woes\
  \ of the people living in different areas falling under NA-123, Lahore VI, which\
  \ proved a PML-N stronghold in the last general elections. The poor performance\
  \ of Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) and Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC)\
  \ in their respective domains as well as the alarming increase in the street crime\
  \ and failure of police in curbing it are the two core issues confronted by the\
  \ people of NA-123, Lahore VI. Besides, other issues which need immediate attention,\
  \ according the local population include streets inundated due to rains, heavily\
  \ encroached main roads and routine traffic mess mainly due to the absence of traffic\
  \ wardens. Keeping in view the last general election results, NA-123, Lahore VI\
  \ can rightly be called a PML-N bastion as its ticket-holder Pervaiz Malik emerged\
  \ victorious by getting more than 120,000 votes. The votes bagged by the PML-N candidate\
  \ on this seat were more than the party head Nawaz Sharif, who could get around\
  \ 92,000 votes from NA-120. However, the local people believe that justice wasn\u2019\
  t done to them according to the level of confidence they had shown into the party.\
  \ The provincial constituencies falling under NA-123 are PP-143 and PP-144 where\
  \ Chaudhry Shahbaz Ahmed and Bau Akhter are sitting MPAs. Shahbaz has returned for\
  \ his second term and he is also the Vice Chairman of WASA. The major areas falling\
  \ in this constituency include a big portion of Shadbagh (rest falls in NA-119)\
  \ comprised of Amir Road, Bhamman and Jhuggian Villages, Bhagatpura, China Scheme,\
  \ Gujjarpura, Alya Town, Shawala Chowk, Janipura, Ghoray Shah, ample portion of\
  \ GT Road near Baghbanpura. Most of the development in the area took place after\
  \ the Local Government polls of 2001 and 2005. Most of the areas of NA-123, particularly\
  \ pertaining to China Scheme and Gujjarpura side are a picture of neglect, which\
  \ local people believe is due to multiple reasons such as apathy of the elected\
  \ representatives, poor performance of the government bodies and above all, the\
  \ absence of local bodies which could well tackle the issues like past. The survey\
  \ conducted in the constituency found that most of the open grounds had turned into\
  \ dumping ground and local people complained that not a single time, any staffer\
  \ of LWMC bothered to remove filth. What has added to the troubles of the local\
  \ population is stagnant water in the open areas, which has become a permanent breeding\
  \ ground for mosquitoes, which not necessarily cause dengue, but could cause malaria\
  \ outbreak.A group of students while talking to The News complained that they were\
  \ yet to see the elected representatives in their areas and due to their lack of\
  \ concern, the officials from different departments never pay attention towards\
  \ these areas. A ground, just in front of a well-known girls college in China Scheme,\
  \ near the drain is filled with fresh water and is a breeding place for dengue mosquito,\
  \ which has played havoc with hundreds of lives during last six to eight years in\
  \ Lahore, remained unchecked. Imran, one of the boys who have turned up to play\
  \ cricket there told The News that not only in this particular area, even in many\
  \ adjacent parts, filth had become a common sight but there had been no measures\
  \ to remove it. However, the people have also taken a sigh of relief over the repair\
  \ work being carried out on the Shadbagh-China Scheme drain, which is more than\
  \ 3km long and whose boundary wall at different points had been broken and posing\
  \ serious life risk to commuters. The boundary wall of this drain had been raised\
  \ from different sides and at some points, even more than 40 feet area of the wall\
  \ washed away by the rains in September. On most of the occasions, attention of\
  \ the relevant quarters was drawn through different sources to build the boundary\
  \ wall of the drain which could prove hazardous in case any bus or vehicle carrying\
  \ passengers falls into it. Local people stated that number of times, motorcyclists\
  \ had fallen into the drain and faced serious injuries and now after local MNA Pervaiz\
  \ Malik and MPA Chaudhry Shahbaz took notice, the repair work has been started.\
  \ Local people told The News that even before the September rains which caused huge\
  \ loss to the wall of the drain, most of the its points were damaged which also\
  \ resulted in accidents and were an open death trap. Besides, a positive development\
  \ in the area is regarding the condition of public parks which have improved as\
  \ compared to past, when most of them were not only a picture of neglect, but also\
  \ safe havens for drug addicts in the evening.Apart from a boys college, the Punjab\
  \ government has also set up a degree college for women in the area and local people\
  \ hailed this initiative. Shaista Pervaiz Malik, wife of the sitting MNA Pervaiz\
  \ Malik and herself an MNA on seats reserved for women also seem active in party\
  \ affairs in the constituency.Street crimeStreet crime is another prime matter of\
  \ concern for most of the local people who said that in the area of Shadbagh, particularly\
  \ near Amir Road, Bhagatpura, Pir Ronki Park needed proper police attention. The\
  \ area of NA-123, particularly falling mostly under PP-143 is the precinct of two\
  \ police stations, including Shadbagh and Gujjarpura. One of it, Shadbagh falls\
  \ in City Division which is headed by SP Asad Sarfaraz Khan. Gujjarpura Police Station\
  \ is the part of Civil Lines Division which is headed by SP Imtiaz Sarwar.Situation\
  \ in Shadbagh witnessed some improvement in the area since the new SP took over\
  \ in June this year, unfortunately, local police failed to ensure proper security\
  \ of citizens later. Only in the month of December, the incidents of bike snatching,\
  \ bike theft, robbery have witnessed a drastic rise as compared to the past months,\
  \ since the new SHO, Sub Inspector Mohammad Raza took over the charge. In the latest\
  \ incident occurring on December 28 (Sunday), Fahad, a student and resident of Chaudhry\
  \ Park, Shadbagh was deprived of his new motorbike by two armed motorcyclists, which\
  \ he had purchased just a night ago. Fahad was just on his way to home and quite\
  \ close to his house, he was intercepted by two armed men who, at gunpoint snatched\
  \ his new motorbike and fled from the scene. According to his family, the emergency\
  \ 15 call was done soon after the incident but it took more than 30 minutes for\
  \ the police team to reach the spot. The FIR of the incident has been registered.\
  \ In the month of December, Fayiz, a student was deprived of his bike in daylight.The\
  \ incident took place near old Wapda office situated close to Akram Park, Shadbagh.\
  \ FIR was registered but so far no progress had been made in the case.Family of\
  \ Fayiz told The News that unknown persons broke into their house last year and\
  \ made away with a bike. So, in 2013 and 2014, the same family had been deprived\
  \ of the vehicles twice. Most of the people in the constituency complained that\
  \ no elected representatives visited them to inquire about their condition. Similarly,\
  \ Sajjad, a trader lost his motorbike which was parked just outside his residence\
  \ on December 17 from Chaudhry Park. However, the incident which exposes the level\
  \ of law and order is related with a robbery which took place on a department store\
  \ owned by a youth named Abdul Qadeer. On December 10, Abdul Qadeer was sitting\
  \ in his store when three unidentified men, at gunpoint robbed him of around Rs30,000\
  \ cash. The incident took place in the evening. What shocks most of the local people\
  \ is the fact that this wasn\u2019t the first incident on this shop, as three persons,\
  \ this year had also deprived the shop owner of his laptop, mobile phones and around\
  \ Rs90,000 in the month of April. At that time, Inspector Kamran Zaman was SHO Shadbagh\
  \ whereas Imtiaz Sarwar was in-charge of the City Division. The shop owner time\
  \ and again visited the police station but no official paid any heed towards his\
  \ complaint and this time, having faced another robbery, the heartbroken citizen\
  \ didn\u2019t visit the police station. When contacted, Abdul Qadeer stated that\
  \ in the same year, he had been robbed twice but not a single police official visited\
  \ his shop to probe the incident, although the police station was situated just\
  \ a few yards away from his store. Sufyan and Hamza, two brothers who run a mobile\
  \ shop, in the front lane of Qadeer\u2019s store at Amir Road, have also been looted\
  \ by a two dacoits who, after entering the shop snatched cash from a salesman and\
  \ after threatening of dire consequences, left the shop while drawing its shutter\
  \ down a couple of months ago.In the same week, Shaukat Ali, a resident of Gujjarpura\
  \ on his way to home was deprived of around Rs100,000 cash, ATM cards and other\
  \ documents by unidentified armed persons near Ilahi Town. Due to lack of police\
  \ patrolling, the incident of car mirror theft have also become a routine in the\
  \ area. Javed, a resident of Ferozepark, told The News that since 2011, more than\
  \ 10 times, the mirror of his car had been stolen by unknown persons but only verbal\
  \ assurances were given to him by the police. Within last three months, Javed lost\
  \ side mirrors of his car at night and according to him, the price of a new pair\
  \ is around Rs20,000 but, he had now started buying second hand sets which are not\
  \ less than Rs15,000. Sikander Khan, another resident, and a travel agent by profession\
  \ was deprived of cash, mobile phones and laptop by unknown armed persons in September\
  \ this year just outside his residence, when he was coming back from work. In the\
  \ very next street, unknown persons made away with a sacrificial bull, worth Rs0.1\
  \ million from Ferozepark, just a few days before Eidul Azha. The bull belonged\
  \ to Syed Farooq Iftikhar, a local resident who had tied it just outside his house.\
  \ In all the above cases, so far the victims said that no progress had been made.In\
  \ the area of Chaudhry Park, a few hundred yards from police station, number of\
  \ incidents had occurred and people seemed greatly perturbed due to police failure\
  \ in curbing such occurrences. The ring road underpass, which is a link between\
  \ rest of Shadbagh and Ring Road, near Pir Ronqi graveyard has become a risky area\
  \ for most of the persons. Naeem, a businessman, was also deprived of cash, mobile\
  \ sets and other valuables a few months ago. The local police officials claimed\
  \ that they were making the all-out effort to curb crime and nab the criminals.\
  \ SHO of Shadbagh Police Station Mohammad Raza stated that police lacked proper\
  \ wireless system and patrolling vehicles which had been taken back by the authorities.\
  \ There was a dire need to facilitate police, recruit more contingents so that they\
  \ could take proper care of this big area. Asad Sarfaraz, SP of City Division told\
  \ The News that situation in his division was \u2018under control\u2019 and police\
  \ had busted gangs and recovered looted material from them. He said in winter, the\
  \ wave of crime increased but at the same time, police was committed to eliminate\
  \ crime. In the area of Gujjarpura, local people expressed dissatisfaction over\
  \ the police role in curbing street crimes. However, Qamar Abbas, the local SHO\
  \ when contacted said the all-out effort had been made to control crime in the area.\
  \ He said street crime was an international issue. He said there had been complaints\
  \ in the past but situation was improving now and number of street crime incidents\
  \ had come down. Imtiaz Sarwar, SP Civil Lines Division when contacted said the\
  \ police teams had been assigned duties in their respective areas to maintain peace.\
  \ He said all the required measures had been taken to ensure security of the citizens.Traffic\
  \ and encroachments: Traffic mess has also become a routine in most parts of the\
  \ constituency which included Amir Road, Shadbagh-China Scheme drain road, Sher\
  \ Shah Road but traffic wardens are seen seldom in these parts. Moreover, major\
  \ roads, including ample portion of GT Road, falling in PP-144 are heavily encroached\
  \ which cause routine traffic mess. The matter had also been taken up in Punjab\
  \ Assembly by the MPA Bau Akhter and another female MPA hailing from the area, Raheela\
  \ Khadim Hussein. However, no action, so far has been taken.Local Representatives\u2019\
  \ views: MNA Pervaiz Malik told The News that there was no denying the fact that\
  \ there were issues which needed solution but at the same time, the PML-N government\
  \ had also left no stone unturned in providing every possible relief to the people.\
  \ He said as an MNA, he was totally connected with the people of his constituency\
  \ and his doors were always open for them. He said PML-N was committed to provide\
  \ maximum relief to the public. Chaudhry Shahbaz Ahmed, the MPA elected from PP-143\
  \ said special focus had been laid to improve the situation of schools, colleges,\
  \ roads but despite all steps, there were always room for improvement. He said the\
  \ government would take all steps to address the complaints of local people regarding\
  \ any department.Bau Akhter, MPA elected from PP-144 while talking to The News stated\
  \ there was no doubt that basic issues concerning public were there in the constituency\
  \ but at the same time, concrete measures had been taken by the government to address\
  \ them. He said in order to address the issue of clean drinking water, the chief\
  \ minister had taken special initiatives. Besides, he said the people in his constituency\
  \ also faced environmental issues due the presence of factories situated in the\
  \ residential areas. However, he said measures were also underway to tackle this\
  \ issue. Regarding law and order, he said shortage of police force was the prime\
  \ cause behind this issue which certainly needed to be addressed. He said presence\
  \ of a local government was necessary in addressing the basic public issues."

  \ of work on Peshawar Morr Terminal, Hanif Abbasi said that over 9 flyovers, 4 under\
  \ passes and 4 ramps have to be constructed on terminal plan. Moreover, the volume\
  \ of work of MBP of Rawalpindi and Islamabad is 40 per cent more than compared to\
  \ Lahore MBP. On the directions of the Punjab chief minister, work on the project\
  \ has been further expedited for meeting the new deadline. On the other hand, people\
  \ including labourers carrying out work on the project, claimed that there is no\
  \ possibility that it would be completed on new schedule date of January 30, 2015.\
  \ The labourers working in Chandni Chowk and other different project points like\
  \ Rehmanabad and Islamabad on condition of anonymity told this scribe that the project\
  \ is likely to completed in March next year. Giving reasons, they said that there\
  \ is 50 per cent shortage of labourers for such a big project. Those working on\
  \ it, receives only Rs 450 as daily charges, working for more than 12 hours a day.\
  \ \u201COn this daily wage, we have to eat food and tea from our own money and Rs200\
  \ are spent for this purpose each day. A number of middle aged labourers get tired\
  \ during working hours and take almost two hours rest,\u201D they claimed. They\
  \ like other people claimed that work on the project is going on slow note because\
  \ of shortage of 50 per cent staff. If the authorities pay handsome wages then people\
  \ would join as labourers to work on the project, they told. However, replying to\
  \ the claims of the labourers, Hanif Abbasi as well as project director of the MBP,\
  \ Commissioner Zahid Saeed cleared that each labourer is being paid Rs600 as daily\
  \ wages. Those who are receiving Rs450 as claimed by the labourers themselves would\
  \ have been hired by sub contractors who are awarded certain sections of the project.\
  \ However, the chairman assured that he would take up the issue and direct the sub\
  \ contractors for paying the fixed wages of Rs600 to every labourer. Further, Hanif\
  \ Abbasi told that though project was inaugurated on February, however, the first\
  \ contract of it was awarded on March 28, 2014 and work started in mid April. In\
  \ view of this situation, when the project would meet the deadline of January 30,\
  \ then it means only 7 months have been taken in its completion period against the\
  \ 10 months time. The project remained delayed due to political reasons, which is\
  \ Dharnas by PTI and PAT. The sit-in of PTI lasted for 127 days which means four\
  \ months which created hurdle in work on the project in Islamabad section."

text: "Circular debt \u2013 a vicious cycle of unpaid bills\n                    \
  \        A recent report of the central bank said the problems in the energy system\
  \ have worsened as reflected in the persistence of load management and the re-emergence\
  \ of inter-corporate circular debt. Circular debt, - a vicious cycle of unpaid bills\
  \ running through the entire power-generation chain, swollen to nearly 2.0 percent\
  \ of GDP and has threaten the functioning of the energy sector.The government, to\
  \ limit the accumulation of circular debt, imposed a surcharge of Rs 0.30/unit from\
  \ October 2014 following soft crude prices. The adjustment implied an effective\
  \ increase of 2.5 percent in electricity tariffs and the government is planned to\
  \ make more adjustments in January and February 2015 to reduce electricity subsidies\
  \ to 0.7 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year.The current fiscal year started\
  \ on a positive note, when the government settled circular debt of Rs 500 billion\
  \ in June 2013. Furthermore, the Pakistan Muslim League\u2019s government was also\
  \ showed its committed to resolve the root causes for the power crisis. The government\
  \ then vowed to implement a time-bound plan to tackle price distortions; inadequate\
  \ collections; costly and poorly targeted subsidies; governance and regulatory deficiencies;\
  \ and low efficiency in the supply and distribution of energy. Unfortunately, most\
  \ of the needed reforms including privatization of distribution companies; increase\
  \ in household tariffs; price rationalization of CNG; and lower priority to households\
  \ in gas allocations, either could not be initiated, or made very slow progress.\
  \ The demand-supply gap hovered around 4,000 megawatt during the year showed a marked\
  \ deterioration.Qasim Niaz, Chairman IPPs Advisory Committee (IPPAC), said the government\
  \ has made some payments to the power producers to run their plants on maximum capacity\
  \ as hydroelectricity fell in winters. However, the initiative is not a sustainable\
  \ solution.\u201CThe government should avoid delay in payments, which would curtail\
  \ accumulation of circular debt and enable IPPs to run on maximum capacity,\u201D\
  \ Niaz said. Analysts said the vicious cycle of debt once again bogged down energy\
  \ supply chain as power distributors delay payments to generators who, in turn,\
  \ face difficulty in clearing dues of fuel suppliers like Pakistan State Oil.An\
  \ expansive fuel mix is partly blamed for the country\u2019s energy woes. The average\
  \ fuel component of generation cost on furnace oil has increased to Rs19/kilowatt\
  \ hour in 2013 from Rs12 in 2011, while generation cost on coal is around Rs3/unit.Still\
  \ there has been no significant progress made on the coal side. Although, a number\
  \ of power producers announced to convert on coal, none has been able to achieve\
  \ the financial close so far primarily because of the lethargic attitude of National\
  \ Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).\u201CVested interest groups mainly\
  \ the infamous oil mafia in the country, keep bringing up frivolous points against\
  \ coal, which is costing $700,000/day to consumers of Karachi,\u201D an official\
  \ of an IPP intending to convert on coal said. \u201CRunning 420 megawatts plant\
  \ on furnace oil costs $500 million a year and it would cost less than $250 million\
  \ on coal.\u201D\u201CThe addiction to oil is set to be replaced by addiction to\
  \ natural gas/LNG. LNG is better than oil but still more expensive than coal,\u201D\
  \ he said.The central bank report said energy conservation must be promoted to manage\
  \ the demand-supply gap in the short-run along with supply initiatives to find a\
  \ long-term solution of the issue. On the demand side, no policy initiative was\
  \ implemented to rationalize power consumption.The government though increased tariffs\
  \ in October; it was more focused on commercial and industries users, compared to\
  \ household users who are less productive from an economic point of view. Given\
  \ the need to rebalance power consumption between productive and non-productive\
  \ users, these tariff revisions could have been better targeted, the central bank\
  \ said.The bank believes that without bringing the consumption mix to a more optimum\
  \ level, the likelihood of exiting the ongoing power crisis is not promising.\u201C\
  Both natural gas and electricity tariffs for households need to be rationalized\
  \ to encourage households to invest in more efficient appliances and reduce wastage.\
  \ Ultimately, sustainable economic development will depend on changing the mindset\
  \ that cheap energy is a right, with a culture that encourages conservation and\
  \ productive usage,\u201D the bank said in its report.The IMF, in its December review,\
  \ notes that the supply shortages stem from a lack of sufficient installed capacity\
  \ to cover peak demand but also from the inability to keep installed plants running\
  \ at peak output due to shortages of gas and of money to provide sufficient fuel\
  \ oil in expensive oil-fired plants.\u201CThere are also significant line losses\
  \ in the distribution system due to inefficiencies and theft,\u201D IMF said.The\
  \ efficiency testing of fuel-based electricity generation companies and three rehabilitations\
  \ are expected to recover around 700 megawatts of capacity and increase efficiency\
  \ by 1\u20131.5 percent. In the medium-term, the government will complete construction\
  \ of an LNG terminal to ease gas shortages to increase electricity production, while\
  \ also encouraging higher domestic gas production.The government aims to promote\
  \ policies for private investment in power generation through both the entry of\
  \ new players as well as expanding existing capacity of those IPPs systematically\
  \ adhering to energy mix targets and least-cost generation plans. These expansions\
  \ are expected to generate additional 2,000 megawatts by 2016. Finally, in the longer-run\
  \ they are launching the development of several major hydropower projects."

  \              IslamabadIn a bid to curb terrorist financing, Pakistan will have\
  \ to enact Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) law with the approval of Parliament and\
  \ synchronise legal mechanism at provincial levels for tracking down financiers\
  \ of terror groups. \"Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi was released by the court mainly because\
  \ neither Pakistan nor India put MLA in place so the dossier sent out by New Delhi\
  \ to Islamabad could not be held admissible as evidence before the court of law,\"\
  \ former caretaker law minister and expert on international law Bilal Ahmer Sufi\
  \ told reporters here on Tuesday. MLA, he said, was in place in UK and in many other\
  \ western countries. The military operation is just one aspect, which could be termed\
  \ as surgery but the government would have to put in place legal framework to move\
  \ ahead on blocking terror financing. He said the provincial governments would have\
  \ to enact laws in order to place effective mechanism on all those fronts where\
  \ powers were devolved under 18th constitutional amendment. A mutual legal assistance\
  \ treaty (MLAT) is an agreement between two or more countries for the purpose of\
  \ gathering and exchanging information in an effort to enforce public criminal laws.\
  \ The modern states have developed mechanisms for requesting and obtaining evidence\
  \ for criminal investigations and prosecutions. When evidence or other forms of\
  \ legal assistance, such as witnesses' statements or the service of documents are\
  \ needed from a foreign sovereign, states may attempt to cooperate informally through\
  \ their respective police agencies or, alternatively, resort to what is typically\
  \ referred to as requests for \"mutual legal assistance\". The practice of mutual\
  \ legal assistance developed from the comity-based system of letters rogatory, though\
  \ it is now far more common for states to make mutual legal assistance requests\
  \ directly to the designated \"Central Authorities\" within each state. In contemporary\
  \ practice, such requests may still be made on the basis of reciprocity but may\
  \ also be made pursuant to bilateral and multilateral treaties that obligate countries\
  \ to provide assistance. This assistance may take the form of examining and identifying\
  \ people, places and things, custodial transfers, and providing assistance with\
  \ the immobilisation of the instruments of criminal activity. With regard to the\
  \ latter, MLATs between the United States and Caribbean nations do not cover U.S.\
  \ tax evasion, and are therefore ineffective when applied to Caribbean countries,\
  \ which usually act as offshore tax havens. Assistance may be denied by either country\
  \ (according to agreement details) for political or security reasons, or if the\
  \ criminal offence in question is not equally punishable in both countries. Some\
  \ treaties may encourage assistance with legal aid for nationals in other countries.\
  \ Under the initiative of United Nations to counter terrorism, member states are\
  \ negotiating an additional international treaty, a draft comprehensive convention\
  \ on international terrorism. This convention would complement the existing framework\
  \ of international anti-terrorism instruments and would build on key guiding principles\
  \ already present in recent anti-terrorist conventions: the importance of criminalisation\
  \ of terrorist offences, making them punishable by law and calling for prosecution\
  \ or extradition of the perpetrators; the need to eliminate legislation which establishes\
  \ exceptions to such criminalisation on political, philosophical, ideological, racial,\
  \ ethnic, religious or similar grounds; a strong call for member states to take\
  \ action to prevent terrorist acts; and emphasis on the need for member states to\
  \ cooperate, exchange information and provide each other with the greatest measure\
  \ of assistance in connection with the prevention, investigation and prosecution\
  \ of terrorist acts."

text: "New drug pricing policy: will it really purge the system of discretion?\n \
  \                           Islamabad The final draft of the new drug pricing policy\
  \ only awaits the Prime Minister\u2019s approval now. While official sources are\
  \ widely praising the policy for offering a comprehensive pricing formula that will\
  \ purge the system of discretion, and for recommending a freeze on prices of drugs\
  \ till June 2016 (at levels of 2013), independent analysts are expressing serious\
  \ reservations about what the policy will eventually entail. \u201CThe role of officials\
  \ in determining or revising the prices of drugs has been done away with. There\
  \ shall be no interaction with officials in matters of price revision. The policy\
  \ not only provides a clear formula under which drug prices would be regulated,\
  \ but also supports that the prices of drugs be frozen till June 2016 at levels\
  \ of 2013, whereafter the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shall be applied,\u201D official\
  \ sources privy to the development confided. What sounds good, at least on the face\
  \ of it, is not all that rosy when seen from the lens of public health experts and\
  \ pharmaceutical sector specialists.  Dr. Sania Nishtar, an internationally acclaimed\
  \ health expert who has independently authored numerous health policy documents\
  \ and action plans, and who is also the founder president of Heartfile, believes\
  \ \u201Cthere is a need to critically review the policy parameters currently outlined\
  \ in the draft policy, which is in the public domain.\u201D  Dr. Sania pointed out\
  \ that \u201CWhilst the current iteration of the drug pricing policy intends to\
  \ purge the system of discretion, it may inadvertently end up doing exactly the\
  \ opposite, since withdrawal of SRO 1002 and mandatory price reductions will lead\
  \ most manufacturers to try and come under the \u2018hardship\u2019 policy umbrella\
  \ and apply to the regulator for exceptions. Far from \u2018purging the system of\
  \ discretion\u2019 as claimed in the title of the policy, this strengthens the regulator\u2019\
  s discretionary role.\u201D Dr. Sania emphasised that price regulation is a very\
  \ tricky and complicated area. As described by her in her book, \u2018Choked Pipes,\u2019\
  \ \u201CThe agenda of price regulation is subject to conflicting political interests\
  \ and lobbying by strong interest groups in the pharmaceutical sector in an environment\
  \ of weak regulation and endemic collusion.\u201D Dr. Sania further states in the\
  \ book that, \u201CIn order to achieve the objective of affordable prices of essential\
  \ medicines, a review of available options is critically important.\u201D On the\
  \ other hand, public health pharmacist Ayyaz Kiani, who is also editor of the \u2018\
  Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice,\u2019 published by BioMed Central,\
  \ UK, thinks it is a good policy for three reasons. \u201CFirstly, it intends to\
  \ remove discretionary powers of the regulators, which is a good step, at least\
  \ in intention, as much will depend on how this policy will be implemented. Secondly,\
  \ the policy makes price increase painless for the industry as they may now follow\
  \ the formula and increase prices annually on their own without having to go through\
  \ cumbersome procedures with DRAP. And thirdly, because there is ample emphasis\
  \ on protecting public interest by giving priority to addressing public health issues.\u201D\
  \ The draft policy is stated to have been finalised by the Policy Board of the Drug\
  \ Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) after inputs from various stakeholder\
  \ organisations namely, the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, Pharma\
  \ Bureau, Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, and public sector stakeholders\
  \ including ministries of Commerce, Industries and Finance, and Board of Investment.\
  \ Ayyaz regretted that no input on the important policy has been sought from the\
  \ civil society or consumer advocates. \u201CMoreover, whatever consultation was\
  \ done with the industry did not help as their point of view has been sidelined;\
  \ they are up in arms against it, and have gone to court. These industry representatives\
  \ strongly disagree with the pricing policy. Such confrontation should have been\
  \ avoided. Regulators cannot expect to regulate a sector intent on failing them.\
  \ It has to be a win-win situation for stakeholders for a public policy to successfully\
  \ deliver the envisaged benefits,\u201D he stated when asked for comments. Commenting\
  \ on prices of drugs being frozen till June 2016 (at levels of 2013), Ayyaz said,\
  \ \u201CThere is no justification for this drastic step, which has been strongly\
  \ contested by the pharmaceutical industry as being too harsh and punitive without\
  \ justification. Personally, I think such retrospective implementation is bad policy,\u201D\
  \ he was of the view. Official sources believe the new policy aims to ensure availability\
  \ of quality drugs at affordable prices to patients on the one hand, and to keep\
  \ the industry viable, ensuring its growth and promoting investment in the country,\
  \ on the other.  Ayyaz viewed this claim with skepticism. \u201CThe industry does\
  \ not think such an objective is being served through this policy; they believe\
  \ it is \u2018disabling\u2019 rather than \u2018enabling\u2019 growth and further\
  \ investment in the sector. The pharma industry (especially its foreign investment\
  \ component) has indeed been lately disinvesting, and prospects of growth already\
  \ seem remote,\u201D he flagged.  Sharing the key features of the drug pricing policy,\
  \ sources confided that drugs have been divided into two categories in terms of\
  \ pricing. The first category, that of scheduled drugs, includes most commonly used\
  \ top 50 drugs, drugs on essential list, drugs for treatment of Cancer, TB, Hepatitis,\
  \ HIV, Thalassaemia and Organ Transplant, biological and new chemical entities.\
  \ In the second category, which is that of non-scheduled drugs, the prices of drugs\
  \ not coming under the scheduled category shall be \u2018partially\u2019 regulated\
  \ in terms of pricing. Commenting on this categorization, Ayyaz said, the top 50\
  \ used drugs is not a good point to start as many non-essential and indeed irrational\
  \ drugs exist in this category, and as such, protecting this group of medicines\
  \ through higher level of control will be counterproductive. \u201CAll the others\
  \ categories in this list have clear public health importance and have been correctly\
  \ prioritized for protection,\u201D he added.  With reference to price fixation\
  \ of new chemical entities (NCEs), the policy document states that price fixation\
  \ of originator brand of NCE shall be based on average price of the same brand in\
  \ India and Bangladesh. If originator brand of NCE has not been marketed in India\
  \ or Bangladesh, its maximum retail price shall be fixed equal to the lowest of\
  \ the following, namely: 1) retail price in developing countries which regulate\
  \ drug prices; 2) whole sale price of in UK Monthly Index of Medical Supplies or\
  \ British National Formulary or Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or New\
  \ Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency. The document also states that the prices\
  \ of generic substitutes of the NCE shall be fixed @ 30% less than the originator\
  \ brand price. Sharing his views, Ayyaz pointed out that all of the above clauses\
  \ depend too much on what goes in other countries, and reflect Pakistani regulators\u2019\
  \ inability to adjudicate prices in Pakistan. The policy also contains a clause\
  \ for price reduction after recovery of research cost, sources claimed. To this\
  \ effect, the document mentions that \u201Cprices of originator brands of new chemical\
  \ entities will be reduced by 30% after 5 years of its registration or when 3 or\
  \ more me-toos/biosimilars have been marketed, whichever is earlier. Ayyaz termed\
  \ this as a good step but emphasized the need for \u201Cclarity on what would be\
  \ the base for calculation of the reduction: whether the starting price or the one\
  \ at the end of the 5th year?\u201D As for increase in prices of drugs, the policy\
  \ stipulates that effective July 1, 2016, annual increase shall be linked with CPI\
  \ of the immediately preceding financial year. \u201CManufacturers and importers\
  \ may increase their existing maximum retail prices of scheduled drugs up to 50%\
  \ of CPI (with a cap of 4%) and maximum retail prices of non-scheduled drugs up\
  \ to 70% of CPI (with a cap of 6%) once in any financial year. The calculation of\
  \ revised maximum retail price shall be intimated to the Authority (Division of\
  \ Costing and Pricing) at least 15 days prior to affecting the increase. Non-intimation\
  \ of prices shall be construed as non-revision of maximum retail prices. The failure\
  \ to intimate the increase in price shall tantamount to nullifying the price increase,\u201D\
  \ sources shared. In order to encourage the production of lower-priced drugs, the\
  \ policy states that drugs whose prices are less than Rs. 2 per tablet/capsule,\
  \ Rs. 2 per 5ml of syrup, Rs. 2 per 1 gm of cream/ointment/gel, Rs. 2 per patch,\
  \ Rs. 4 per sachet, and Rs. 10 per injection shall be deemed to be non-scheduled\
  \ drugs.  Similarly, locally manufactured products approved for export to developed\
  \ countries like USA, UK, EU countries, Japan, Australia or WHO shall be exempted\
  \ from price control in the local market to encourage manufacturing and export of\
  \ quality drugs, subject to the conditions that FOB price for export is not less\
  \ than the ex-factory price in the country. \u201CThis is totally unacceptable as\
  \ a small amount of export of a product would exempt it totally for domestic price\
  \ control. This one clause, in fact, nullifies all the public health benefits of\
  \ regulation through this price,\u201D Ayyaz pointed out.  The policy document also\
  \ states that a procedure shall be devised by the Policy Board to review maximum\
  \ retail prices of drugs which have become non-viable to market. Prices will be\
  \ fixed on the basis of competitive manufacturing cost and will be uniform for all\
  \ companies. \u201CThis will help boost availability of low-priced essential medicines\
  \ which has been a protracted problem in the market. Kudos for this,\u201D Ayyaz\
  \ remarked. The Policy Board has also decided to make amendments in the law so that\
  \ overcharged amounts by the industry/hospital/ retailer plus penalty @ 20% per\
  \ annum will be deposited in the government treasury. Ayyaz said, \u201CThis too\
  \ is a commendable step but will need muscle to implement, which the regulators\
  \ have traditionally lacked.\u201D So before the PM puts his signature on the final\
  \ draft of the drug pricing policy, a review of issues being flagged by independent\
  \ health analysts may help achieve better outcomes in the long run."

text: "2014 darkest year in terms of polio eradication\n                         \
  \   ISLAMABAD: The year 2014 was one of the darkest years in terms of polio eradication\
  \ in Pakistan with around 300 polio cases, highest in last 16 years, and killing\
  \ of dozens of polio workers across the country but the government is hopeful that\
  \ its National Action Plan against terrorism would also help the country in defeating\
  \ polio.Also in 2014, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it mandatory\
  \ for Pakistanis travelling abroad to receive at least one dose of anti-polio vaccine,\
  \ since the country was accused of exporting the virus to other regions. According\
  \ to the UN health body, Pakistan accounts for 94% of the world polio cases while\
  \ the country has recorded a 300 percent increase in these cases during 2014 from\
  \ 93 to 295 so far while hundreds of samples are still being tested in National\
  \ Institute of Health (NIH). Nigeria and Afghanistan are the only two other countries\
  \ with endemic polio but both have recorded decrease in polio cases in 2014. Nigeria\
  \ recorded 450% decrease in polio cases last year as the number went down from 50\
  \ to 12.Pakistani health official claims that polio has largely become a security\
  \ related issue as 85 percent of the polio cases have been reported from security\
  \ compromised areas where vaccination teams cannot immunise the children owing to\
  \ fear of attacks. According to official figures 74 polio workers have been killed\
  \ so far in Pakistan since 2012.An official working with polio eradication programme\
  \ said it was a massive communication failure on the part of the authorities as\
  \ around 50,000 families have refused to vaccinate their children against polio\
  \ owing to doubts about the programme despite huge media campaign by the government\
  \ and Unicef. He said 50,000 is recorded figure of refusal cases while rough estimates\
  \ suggest that over 150,000 families have refused polio vaccination, but the polio\
  \ teams are reluctant to record these refusal cases as it would indicate their power\
  \ performance.\u201CIt is a communication failure as almost all segments of society\
  \ have doubts or concerns about polio vaccine,\u201D said a top official with polio\
  \ eradication programme requesting anonymity.He said upper class has doubts about\
  \ polio workers\u2019 hygiene and quality of the vaccine so they may opt for private\
  \ vaccination. The middle class is angry with government\u2019s lack of focus on\
  \ development and other health needs of people so they doubt why polio is given\
  \ priority, he said adding that lower class think polio vaccine is a conspiracy\
  \ against Muslims hatched by West to reduce the population of Muslims. They also\
  \ cite the example of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) spy Shakeel Afridi who used\
  \ a fake polio campaign to trace Osama Bin Laden in Abbotabad.The official said\
  \ the authorities have failed to devise an effective communication strategy to convince\
  \ all three segments of society about the need, utility and efficacy of polio vaccine.\u201C\
  Ulema have been used on TV advertisements to support polio vaccination, but a large\
  \ number of people who refuse polio vaccine on religious grounds do not watch TV\
  \ at all. There is a need of localized communication strategies with cultural consideration\
  \ of each area to effectively eliminate doubts about polio programme,\u201D the\
  \ official said.He said Unicef is brining foreign communication experts to devise\
  \ communication plan for the rural areas of Pakistan, but these experts are not\
  \ aware of indigenous culture.However, when contacted by The News, the head of Prime\
  \ Minister\u2019s Polio Monitoring and Coordination Cell, Ayesha Farooq, said the\
  \ government has re-devised its strategy against polio which will show results in\
  \ next few months.She said the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has expressed personal\
  \ resolve to eliminate polio from the country and drastic measures have been taken\
  \ during last few months in this regard.She said 85 percent cases of polio have\
  \ been recorded in security compromised areas of Waziristan, Khyber Agency, Peshawar\
  \ and Karachi.\u201CAs many as 241 polio cases (81.7 percent) were reported this\
  \ year from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Fata which indicates a direct correlation between\
  \ incidence of polio cases and access issues due to security,\u201D she said.Ayesha\
  \ Farooq, who is also the legislator of ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), said\
  \ innovative measures have been taken by the government with the involvements of\
  \ provinces.\u201CRoutine immunisation will also be increased as a part of new strategy.\
  \ Media is being used to spread the message, and the help of parliamentarians and\
  \ civil society is being sought for this national cause,\u201D she said.\u201CDuring\
  \ 2014, a total of 17 National, Sub-National and short interval polio campaigns\
  \ were conducted to immunize the target population of 34.6 million children below\
  \ five years of age for each national campaign,\u201D she added.The official figures\
  \ show that on an average 92 percent of the total target population were reached\
  \ during these campaigns. In addition more than 16 million children travelling within\
  \ and from outside the country were vaccinated through Permanent Transit Posts (PTPs)\
  \ working in multiple shifts throughout the country at key points during the year.\
  \ At present only wild polio virus Type 1 is circulating in Pakistan while Type\
  \ 2 was eradicated several years ago and no case of Type 3 virus has been reported\
  \ from anywhere in the country since April 2012.The most recent official data puts\
  \ the total number of confirmed polio cases at 295 in 2014 with 174 cases reported\
  \ from Fata, 67 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 29 from Sindh, 22 from Balochistan and\
  \ 03 from Punjab.Also important to note is that of the 73 wild poliovirus cases\
  \ in Khyber Agency, 59 are from Tehsil Bara, 12 from Jamrud and two from Tirah.\
  \ Also, all wild polio cases except one from Khyber Agency this year have been reported\
  \ from May onwards. Furthermore, vaccination activities have been considerably inconsistent\
  \ in Bara Tehsil of Khyber Agency since June 2009, missing a significant number\
  \ of children.All except 10 polio cases reported from North and South Waziristan\
  \ agencies in 2014 did not receive any dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV). It is important\
  \ to mention that no supplementary immunisation activities have been conducted in\
  \ North and most of South Waziristan agencies since June 2012, leading to an ongoing\
  \ explosive polio outbreak with 37 wild polio cases in 2013 and 93 so far in 2014.The\
  \ district of Peshawar has reported 29 wild poliovirus cases in 2014 so far. The\
  \ reintroduction of wild polio virus with the identification of polio cases from\
  \ the districts of Swat, Kohat, Naseerabad, Pishin and Larkana is a concern which\
  \ also reinforces the fact that the presence of polio virus anywhere is a threat\
  \ everywhere.Of all the polio affected children in 2014 as many as 92 percent came\
  \ from families that speak Pashto and more than 84 percent children are below the\
  \ age of 2 years. It would also be important to add here that 85 percent of the\
  \ polio cases this year are from insecure and security compromised areas and 86\
  \ percent of the children did not receive any routine dose while 64 percent did\
  \ not receive any routine and Polio campaign dose.Ninety-nine percent of parents\
  \ across Pakistan come forward and vaccinate their children every time Polio vaccine\
  \ is offered while the refusals, which are below 1 percent of the target population,\
  \ are based on repeated campaign, religious belief or other misconceptions. According\
  \ to experts the current low transmission season is critical to fighting polio as\
  \ the virus is less active and its transmission can be stopped through repeated\
  \ high quality campaigns."

  KARACHI: An application has been filed with Sindh Assembly Speaker Agha Siraj Khan\
  \ Durrani requesting him to ensure that five per cent of vacant positions in the\
  \ assembly secretariat are filled by applicants from religious minorities.Sindh\
  \ Assembly MPA on a reserved seat for minorities, Surender Valasai, who belongs\
  \ to the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, has filed the application.  The Sindh government\
  \ had reserved a five per cent job quota for minorities in its different departments,\
  \ subsidiary agencies and bodies some eight years ago.On February 3, 2015, the then\
  \ house of the Sindh Assembly had also unanimously passed a resolution on this subject.\
  \ The resolution was moved by an Opposition MPA of the Pakistan Muslim League-Functional,\
  \ Nand Kumar Goklani. His resolution stated: \u201CThis House resolves that the\
  \ Provincial Government ensure implementation of 5% quota reserved for minorities\
  \ in employment in government jobs in the province.\u201DOn February 6, 2015 the\
  \ Sindh Assembly secretary sent a circular containing the contents of the resolution\
  \ to the relevant senior officials of the Sindh government for the due implementation\
  \ of the resolution.The circular was sent to the then Sindh chief secretary, the\
  \ Sindh government\u2019s secretary for Services, General Administration, and Coordination\
  \ Department, and the Sindh government Secretary for Minorities\u2019 Affairs Department.Talking\
  \ to The News, Goklani, who has once again become an MPA on a seat reserved for\
  \ minorities, said more than three years had passed but he was yet to get any evidence\
  \ that showed that the Sindh government had implemented his resolution.He said the\
  \ previous PPP government had itself issued orders to ensure five per cent quota\
  \ for minorities in government jobs, but it has failed to implement it until now.\u201C\
  Once it is implemented by PPP\u2019s own government in Sindh, then we could expect\
  \ from the federal government to ensure its implementation,\u201D the PML-F MPA\
  \ said.According to Goklani, he had raised the issue several times in the last Sindh\
  \ Assembly by putting questions during the question hour session and by submitting\
  \ call to attention notices, asking for information on government departments where\
  \ the quota had been implemented."

text: "Political parties fear military courts may target them\n                  \
  \          ISLAMABAD: A primary reason behind expressing reservations to creation\
  \ of military courts by some political parties is their strong apprehension that\
  \ these forums might be used against politicians.Whether any political party has\
  \ publicly aired such fears or not, every one of them has substantial worries in\
  \ the back of their mind that politicians may fall victim to such courts.However,\
  \ this fear apart, no parliamentary party is opposed to the establishment of military\
  \ courts if they exclusively try terrorists because all want elimination of terrorism\
  \ by employing every possible means and tool. All political forces want conviction\
  \ of militants on fast-track basis.Every parliamentary force including even the\
  \ ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had consented to the proposal, though\
  \ hesitantly, after exhaustive discussions. \u201CWe are sure that the parliamentary\
  \ parties will agree to the creation of these courts at the end of the day as we\
  \ are trying to allay their apprehensions,\u201D a senior source which is part of\
  \ the high-level consultations presided over by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif told\
  \ The News.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which has now partially differed\
  \ with the proposal, had stamped its approval on it during the December 24 second\
  \ meeting of the top parliamentary leaders, which was also attended by Chief of\
  \ Army Staff (COAS) General Raheel Sharif and Director General of the Inter-Services\
  \ (ISI) Lt-Gen Rizwan Akhtar.When the recommendation was floated in the lengthy\
  \ session, PTI Chairman Imran Khan had sought time to mull over it but endorsed\
  \ it just after half an hour in the same deliberations.However, his nominee, Hamid\
  \ Khan, advocate, held the view in Monday\u2019s meeting of constitutional experts\
  \ that the PTI was opposed to the military courts. On the other hand, PTI Information\
  \ Secretary Dr Shireen Mazari quickly contradicted Hamid Khan saying that her party\
  \ was not against such bodies. Confusion about the PTI\u2019s policy has unnecessarily\
  \ been spawned.Almost same is the case with the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP).\
  \ In the December 24 discussions, its representatives had also agreed to the proposal.\
  \ The biggest support, though slightly conditional, to the setting up of the military\
  \ courts had come from a person no less than PPP chief and former president Asif\
  \ Ali Zardari. He had stated at the death anniversary congregation of Benazir Bhutto\
  \ in Garhi Khuda Bux on December 27 that his party has backed the recommendation\
  \ with the condition that these courts will not target politicians.However, PPP\
  \ Senator Raza Rabbani has now expressed reservations over military courts and advised\
  \ the government to learn lessons from thepast as two civilian regimes were toppled\
  \ by martial laws. It was always during the PML-N stints that such courts were set\
  \ up, he said.However, PPP Senator Aitzaz simplified the creation of military courts\
  \ saying that they can be established by bringing about a change in an ordinary\
  \ law that the Parliament can pass with a simple majority, and there is no need\
  \ of any constitutional amendment. \u201CWe rejected the draft presented by the\
  \ attorney general in Monday\u2019s meeting and offered a very brief and simple\
  \ amendment in a law to satisfy the mandate of the December 24 deliberations.\u201D\
  Former Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has also described the proposed\
  \ setting up of military courts as unconstitutional. \u201CMilitary courts are illegal\
  \ and unconstitutional. The basic structure of the Constitution guarantees an independent\
  \ judiciary, and military courts cannot be created in the presence of an independent\
  \ judiciary.\u201DThe Jamaat-e-Islami was the first political party that had stood\
  \ against the idea of military courts. But in the December 24 session, it too had\
  \ changed its mind, though reluctantly. The political parties continue to highlight\
  \ their fears and apprehensions despite the fact that General Raheel Sharif has\
  \ categorically assured the parliamentary leaders that he guarantees that these\
  \ forums would only try \u2018jet black terrorists\u2019 with the objective of getting\
  \ rid of the scourge of terrorism and would not arraign any political figure.The\
  \ parliamentary parties, which concurred to the proposal in the presence of the\
  \ COAS but are disapproving it afterward, are following a hypocritical policy. It\
  \ is quite possible that they will be fully on board after another meeting on the\
  \ pattern of the one held on December 24.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has made it\
  \ clear that the creation of the military courts is part of the 20-point National\
  \ Action Plan (NAP), which was unanimously approved by all the parliamentary parties.As\
  \ per the NAP, the military courts are to function for two years. As they try and\
  \ convict hardcore terrorists, the government may use this period to massively rectify\
  \ the normal criminal justice system so as to enable it to meet the new challenges.The\
  \ final go-ahead to the establishment of military courts from all the parliamentary\
  \ parties may be forthcoming with some more discussions and efforts by the prime\
  \ minister and the army leadership. But the biggest test these forums will face\
  \ will come when they will be challenged in a superior court especially in view\
  \ of the fact that the Supreme Court had declared such tribunals null and void back\
  \ in 1999.Generally, the superior courts treat special tribunals as a parallel judiciary,\
  \ which, they are sure, is not allowed under the Constitution. Whenever special\
  \ courts have been disputed at a judicial forum, superior courts have been laying\
  \ down strict guidelines to be followed by them where the parties involved are given\
  \ the due right of hearing, defence and appeal."

  \           ISLAMABAD: Members of parliaments of Pakistan and Afghanistan met for\
  \ the 12th round of Pakistan-Afghanistan Parliamentarians\u2019 Dialogue here called\
  \ for joint efforts and steady steps for preventing terrorist attacks and reiterated\
  \ their resolve against all kinds of terrorism and extremism affecting the two countries.In\
  \ a joint statement issued at the end of the dialogue facilitated by the Pakistan\
  \ Institute of Democracy and Transparency (PILDAT) unequivocally condemned the heinous\
  \ and inhuman terrorist attack of December 16 in Peshawar. Similar dastardly terro-rist\
  \ attacks in Kabul and Paktika province were also deplored.Parliamentarians of the\
  \ two countries acknowledged and appreciated the positive momentum in bilateral\
  \ relations generated through the visit of Afghanistan\u2019s newly-elected President\
  \ Mohammad Ashraf Ghani to Pakistan, in November, this year.The parliamentarians\
  \ also appreciated the vision of building a \u201Cpeaceful neighbourhood\u201D of\
  \ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as a fundamental element of which is the vision of\
  \ a strong, comprehensive and enduring partnership between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\
  \ \u201CA strong and viable bilateral relationship between the two countries is\
  \ the only guarantee of the security and prosperity as well as of peace and development\
  \ in the region,\u201D they said. The parliamentarians as representatives of the\
  \ people of the two neighbourly countries, MPs appreciated that the two countries\
  \ are now ready to, independently and along with each other, take concrete and effective\
  \ steps to counter terrorism and extremism aimed at ensuring peace and stability\
  \ in the region.Participants of the dialogue underscored the need for bilateral\
  \ cooperation, particularly cooperation among the State and security agencies in\
  \ two countries, in fight against terrorism, extremism, and for achieving and maintaining\
  \ peace and stability. In this regard, need for comprehensive and effective laws\
  \ on combating terrorism, including cyber terrorism, was underscored. Parliaments\
  \ and parliamentary committees in both countries should oversee effective implementation\
  \ of these laws. Parliamentarians stressed that trade and commerce between the two\
  \ countries must be prioritised and formalised. Both sides also supported removal\
  \ of bottlenecks and trade barriers and emphasised that facilities for transit trade\

text: "The power of the pulpit\n                            It is hard to know the\
  \ exact figures or ratios, but it seems from the anecdotal evidence available that\
  \ at a significant number of the tens of thousands of mosques scattered around the\
  \ country, there was only limited or no condemnation \u2013 during Friday sermons\
  \ \u2013 of the Taliban for the attack on a Peshawar school. At some mosques tacit\
  \ support was later expressed for Maulana Abdul Aziz, the Lal Masjid head who implicitly\
  \ defended the Taliban action.It would be interesting to get more detailed reports\
  \ on precisely what was said and where. It would also be fascinating to have before\
  \ us a full break-up of which mosques fall under the influence of which groups.\
  \ It is known that some of the larger ones in both Islamabad and Lahore are controlled\
  \ by hard-line outfits such as the Ahle Sunnat-wal Jamaat, formerly the fiercely\
  \ anti-Shia Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan. Despite a ban placed in 2012, the ASWJ continues\
  \ to operate, apparently with unlimited freedom, and spread its fierce message of\
  \ hatred.Other equally damaging messages are spread through mosques too. These are\
  \ directed against women, minorities and \u2018western elements\u2019. What they\
  \ do is nudge along the mindset that has created a deeply bigoted society. It is\
  \ a mindset we have now discovered we must fight.To do so successfully, we will\
  \ have to use the mosque and its powerful pulpits. In other words, the imams who\
  \ delivers their sermons every Friday to millions of worshippers have to be won\
  \ over to the right side of the fence. This is the only way to swing opinion and\
  \ make anything resembling real difference. How to achieve this is something the\
  \ National Action Committee set up to combat terrorism must consider in some detail.\
  \ In other Muslim countries, ways have been found to incorporate clerics and religious\
  \ scholars into key social battles. In Iran and Bangladesh, they have been used\
  \ to help promote family planning and in Egypt to speak out against a variety of\
  \ social problems including female genital mutilation. We too have to follow this\
  \ path and send out a strong message that militancy and the ideas that support it\
  \ can simply not be permitted to permeate the thinking of people.All this is also\
  \ linked to other factors. Outfits spreading hatred against specific groups need\
  \ to be acted against and removed from the sphere of the mosque. Right now, it is\
  \ known that many of the clerics who run smaller mosques in towns or big cities\
  \ fall under their broader umbrella. The mosques, especially in small towns where\
  \ rates of unemployment are high, have also become a recruitment place where extremist\
  \ groups pick up aimless young men for their own purposes. Ajmal Kasab, aged 25\
  \ years when he was hanged in an Indian jail in 2012 for his role in the siege of\
  \ Mumbai four years before that, is an example of the manner in which this process\
  \ takes place. We need to bring it to a halt.Somehow, the clerics delivering weekly\
  \ sermons in mosques need to be brought over to speak against militancy. The key\
  \ problem of course is the funding that comes in to too many mosques or groups linked\
  \ to them in the country, in some cases from sources outside our borders. Nations\
  \ like Bangladesh have found it possible to begin schemes where mosque imams are\
  \ paid to deliver the right kind of messages. We could replicate this model. But\
  \ it would be possibly only if the government was able to surpass the scale of money\
  \ provided by far richer agents who have become key players in the game of death\
  \ in which we are pawns.Spreading messages that alter the manner in which people\
  \ think is nevertheless vital. The media of course could be a central player in\
  \ this. Right now, we have clerics who go along with a particular code of thought\
  \ taught to them at madressahs and by their own teachers. This suggests to them\
  \ that they need to support hard-line views in various ways and inculcate more and\
  \ more people into a specific mould. The mosque, notably since the Zia years, has\
  \ played a key part in creating this mould. It must now play an equal part in breaking\
  \ it.Those who regularly attend mosques speak of the pamphlets distributed within\
  \ many of them, promoting banned groups, or the attempts to collect funds for these\
  \ organizations. In some cases, the clerics of the mosques may not even be aware\
  \ of the nature of the groups they are collecting for. Many are, after all, only\
  \ semi-literate themselves and some may believe they are truly serving a good cause.\
  \ These men who hold significant influence in our society need to be re-educated\
  \ and retrained. A massive scheme of some kind needs to be adopted for this purpose.\
  \ This has been achieved to a certain degree in countries like Egypt, mainly through\
  \ the efforts of the Al-Azhar University in Cairo which stands at the centre of\
  \ the more enlightened views on religion. It is possibly arguable as to why we should\
  \ need to turn to religion in this fashion within our state. After all, it is no\
  \ obscure fact that killing is wrong and the murder of children one of the worst\
  \ offences possible under any rule of humanity or religion. But it appears we need\
  \ to be reminded of this more forcefully than is currently the case. Yes, the Peshawar\
  \ episode has evoked a great deal of shock and horror. But, we need to move forward\
  \ in a way that it is ensured it is not forgotten and never repeated. This can be\
  \ possible only if we are able to alter a great deal about the kind of society we\
  \ have become and remove certain elements that play such a big part in shaping it.Linked\
  \ to the mosque is the question of madressah schools. These have mushroomed primarily\
  \ because of the collapse of the public sector education system. Only a few amongst\
  \ them offer anything resembling actual training in militancy. But almost all pass\
  \ on a particular pattern of thought which in the limited surveys conducted indicates\
  \ learning to see India as an enemy nation and regarding women as being inherently\
  \ inferior. A large number of the clerics who run these mosques have themselves\
  \ emerged from madressahs. These institutes then need to be looked at very carefully\
  \ and policies adopted to at least offer people more options about where they can\
  \ educate their children rather than keeping them within seminaries simply on the\
  \ basis that there is no other place where they can be given education free of all\
  \ cost and also provided food and shelter.These are all matters we need to pay greater\
  \ heed to. The action taken recently against specific clerics promoting hatred is\
  \ welcome. The fact that the judges who wrote out arrest orders in these cases are\
  \ in need of protection tells us just how difficult the task we face is. But the\
  \ mosque and the pulpit need to play a central role in changing the face of our\
  \ country \u2013 which has grown uglier by the decade. We should hear words of true\
  \ wisdom once spoken from the buildings that symbolise our religion. It is sad this\
  \ is not the case today. The writer is a freelance columnist and former newspaper\

  \   Pakistan has obtained a breathing space in the wake of steep decline in prices\
  \ of petroleum products in the international market, which will ease down fiscal\
  \ woes of the country over the short-term.The windfall gains obtained through reduced\
  \ oil prices will not last long in 2015, if structural bottlenecks of the economy\
  \ such as energy outages, security concerns and revenue mobilisation are not resolved.The\
  \ real concern for the government will be continuous trend of low GDP growth again\
  \ this year, as despite tall claims the real GDP growth will not be able to cross\
  \ four percent of GDP against the envisaged target of 5.1 percent for 2014/15.Last\
  \ year growth of 4.1 percent will be revised downward in accordance with the annual\
  \ revision, but this low base will not help jack up growth figure for the ongoing\
  \ fiscal year up to the desired level of the economic managers mainly because of\
  \ bad performance of agriculture and manufacturing sectors.It clearly indicates\
  \ there will be job opportunities for new entrants in the labour market and prevalence\
  \ of poverty will continue to rise during the calendar year 2015.Another challenge\
  \ for the government during 2015 will be keeping the International Monetary Fund\
  \ (IMF) programme on track after completion of the sixth review, which was scheduled\
  \ to be completed by the end of February or early March, 2015.The IMF had largely\
  \ recovered its previous loans, which it provided to Islamabad under the PPP dispensation.\
  \ Now the net inflows are going to start and the phase of tough conditions will\
  \ also be gauged by the IMF from the second quarter (April-June) period of the ongoing\
  \ fiscal year 2014/15.But experts said the breathing space obtained by Islamabad\
  \ in the aftermath of reduction in POL prices would go a long way in keeping the\
  \ IMF programme on track over the short-term and this incumbent regime would be\
  \ able to manage completion of the next review (sixth review) of the IMF programme\
  \ without facing much difficulty.The fiscal side of the economy is real problematic\
  \ area in the wake of expected shortfall in the revenue collection of the Federal\
  \ Board of Revenue (FBR). The government had envisaged annual tax collection target\
  \ of Rs2,810 billion and the IMF had already projected downward revision from Rs2,810\
  \ billion to Rs2,756 billion. However, economists say the FBR\u2019s tax collection\
  \ will stand at the maximum of around Rs2,550 to Rs2,600 billion.In order to bridge\
  \ the gap, the government has jacked up the general sales tax (GST) rate from 17\
  \ percent to 22 percent on POL products in order to offset the revenue losses because\
  \ of reduction in oil prices in the international market.The subsidy to the power\
  \ sector will also decline because of falling prices of the furnace oil so it will\
  \ help curtail the budget deficit close to the level agreed with the IMF for the\
  \ current fiscal year.The interest rates are on the declining trend in the wake\
  \ of decreasing inflation because of base effect in the same period of the last\
  \ fiscal year, but it will rebound in the second half (January-June) period of the\
  \ current fiscal year because of the possible upsurge in the energy prices. But\
  \ inflation on an average will remain around seven percent so the discount rate\
  \ will also come down.\u201CIn the wake of possible reduction in the interest rates,\
  \ Pakistan\u2019s debt servicing will be scaled down by Rs120 to Rs130 billion during\
  \ the current fiscal year on account of both external, as well as domestic loans,\u201D\
  \ official sources said.However, the government would be able to get savings in\
  \ debt servicing and subsidy amounts, which will compensate the FBR\u2019s shortfall.\
  \ If need arises, then the development budget will be slashed down in order to keep\
  \ the budget deficit at around five percent of GDP.Finance Minister Ishaq Dar had\
  \ managed external front of the economy by keeping the IMF programme on track that\
  \ resulted in touching the foreign exchange reserves of $15 billion mark in December\
  \ 2014, as Islamabad got $1.1 billion from the IMF, as well as successfully launched\
  \ Sukuk bond worth $1 billion.Now the balance of payment crisis is over for the\
  \ short- and medium-term after increasing the foreign currency reserves and expected\
  \ saving in the import bill to the tune of $4 billion, but the worrisome indicator\
  \ is declining trends in fetching exports of Pakistani made-ups, which would become\
  \ headache for the economic managers on the long-term basis.There is a silver lining\
  \ on the economic front, as well. If Islamabad manages to attract committed Chinese\
  \ investment of over $40 billion and start moving towards materialising projects\
  \ under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), it can boost the sluggish economy\
  \ of Pakistan."

  \   KARACHI: Legal experts appeared skeptical on Wednesday as to whether finance\
  \ mangers followed the proper procedure in imposing an increase in sales tax on\
  \ petroleum products.They objected on the SRO issued by finance ministry, which\
  \ increased sales tax by 29.5 percent on POL products, saying that it should only\
  \ be act of parliament.\u201CThere are clear instructions in the Constitution and\
  \ Supreme Court orders regarding imposition of tax,\u201D Dr. Ikram ul Haq, advocate\
  \ Supreme Court and leading tax consultant said.A day earlier, the revenue division\
  \ of ministry of finance issued SRO 1152(I)/2014 to enhance the sales tax to 22\
  \ percent from 17 percent, effective January 01, 2015 in order to offset the decline\
  \ in revenue collection due to the oil price shocks.The revenue division issued\
  \ the notification exercising powers vested in clause b sub-section 2 of Section\
  \ 3 of Sales Tax Act, 1990, which allows the federal government to impose tax through\
  \ a notification.Dr. Haq, however, said the Supreme Court in Human Rights Case No\
  \ 14392 of 2013 [2014 PTD 243], combining many others, disapproved undue hikes in\
  \ utilities provided to people and in Iqbal Zafar Jhagra v Federation of Pakistan\
  \ (2014) declared levying of taxes through executive orders unconstitutional.The\
  \ government, despite such cases, which are binding under the Constitution, has\
  \ been resorting to infamous SROs for levy of taxes, he said and added: \u201CSuch\
  \ move of the government may be challenged in court of law.\u201DThe government\
  \ increased the sales tax considering sharp fall in prices of petroleum products\
  \ and a threat to revenue collection. The combined contribution of POL products\
  \ on imports and local supplies is about 40 percent towards total sales tax.Munawar\
  \ H. Shaikh, President, Pakistan Tax Bar Association said the government should\
  \ avoid taking such decision and should go to the parliament for appropriate approval.He\
  \ said the finance minister himself on several occasions announced elimination of\
  \ SRO culture.Another senior tax lawyer, requesting anonymity, said the Supreme\
  \ Court in its observation made in the order of 2013 that the parliament/ legislature\
  \ alone and not the government/executive is empowered to levy tax.The apex court\
  \ in the case also observed: \u201CAs far as delegation of such powers to the Government/Executive\
  \ is concerned, the same is for the purpose of implementation of such laws, which\
  \ is to be done by framing rules, or issuing notifications or guidelines, depending\
  \ upon case to case, as we have come across some of the cases noted hereinabove.\
  \ But in no case, authority to levy tax for the Federation is to be delegated to\
  \ the Government/Executive.\u201DThe lawyer, however, said at present different\
  \ sales tax rates are implemented, if considered Supreme Court judgment, all the\
  \ rates should be withdrawn.On the other hand, officials in Federal Board of Revenue\
  \ (FBR), said soft oil prices have dented sales tax revenue. \u201CIn addition,\
  \ the collection of advance income tax also started declining,\u201D said a FBR\
  \ official.Legal experts admitted the current revenue crisis but said the government\
  \ should present the revision in sales tax rate before the parliament, which is\
  \ summoned on January 1, 2015. They also suggested that the FBR should explore other\
  \ avenues such as broadening of tax base and bringing elites into tax net, who are\
  \ already identified by the tax authorities."

text: "Hanged PAF man was close aide of TTP leader\n                            ISLAMABAD:\
  \ Niaz Mohammad, who was executed the other day in Peshawar Central Prison for trying\
  \ to kill General Pervez Musharraf, used to be a former technician of the Pakistan\
  \ Air Force, who was a close aide of Adnan Rasheed, the chief operational commander\
  \ of the TTP-linked Ansarul Aseer (Helpers of the Prisoners) - a lethal jehadi unit\
  \ which was founded to secure freedom for the imprisoned jehadis by conducting jail\
  \ break operations.Of the seven people hanged so far since the lifting of the moratorium\
  \ on executions last month, six had been involved in two abortive attempts to assassinate\
  \ Pervez Musharraf eleven years ago in Rawalpindi in December 2003. The remaining\
  \ one - Aqeel alias Dr Usman - had also tried to target Musharraf\u2019s plane at\
  \ Chaklala Airport in Rawalpindi with a shoulder missile. However, he was handed\
  \ down a death sentence and sent to the gallows for spearheading the October 10,\
  \ 2009 fidayeen attack targeting the General Headquarters of the Pakistan Army in\
  \ Rawalpindi. Of the seven people hanged so far over the past fortnight, four were\
  \ civilians. While Aqeel alias Dr Usman and Arshad Mahmood alias Mehrban, who were\
  \ hanged in Faisalabad on December 22, belonged to the Pakistan Army, Niaz Mohammad,\
  \ who was executed in Peshawar on December 31, was a PAF employee. Niaz, a resident\
  \ of Yar Hussain area in Swabi district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was kept at the Haripur\
  \ Central Prison until December 30 when he was shifted to Peshawar Central Prison\
  \ in a helicopter, before being executed. According to the military circles, in\
  \ the first assassination attempt on Musharraf, which took place near Jhanda Chichi\
  \ bridge in Rawalpindi on December 14, 2003, six PAF personnel were convicted by\
  \ a field general court martial at the PAF Base Chaklala on October 3, 2005. Besides\
  \ Niaz, four more PAF personnel were also sentenced to death that also included\
  \ a former junior technician Adnan Rashid, who later escaped during the 2012 Bannu\
  \ jailbreak and later joined hands with the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. The other\
  \ three PAF personnel included former chief technician Khalid Mahmood, former senior\
  \ technician Karam Din, and former corporal, Nawazish. The sixth convict, Nasrullah,\
  \ a junior technician, was sentenced to life imprisonment. A PAF appellate court\
  \ dismissed the joint appeal of the six accused in February 2006. Almost a month\
  \ later, on March 28, 2006, the Lahore High Court also dismissed their petitions.\
  \ Six months later, a Supreme Court bench headed by then Chief Justice Iftikhar\
  \ Mohammad Chaudhry had rejected their appeals against the high court verdict [on\
  \ September 25, 2006]. The bench held that under Article 199 of the Constitution,\
  \ civil courts had no jurisdiction to issue writ against orders passed by the military\
  \ courts. In petitions, Niaz Mohammad and other five convicts had alleged they had\
  \ falsely been implicated in the case. They claimed they had voted against General\
  \ Musharraf in the 2002 referendum and, therefore, they were picked up by the agencies\
  \ following the 2003 attempts on his life, only to be kept in illegal detention\
  \ during which they were severely tortured.The proximity between Niaz Mohammad and\
  \ Adnan Rasheed can be gauged from the fact that they had spent most of their prison\
  \ term together, unlike the other four PAF personnel. In September 2011, Adnan Rasheed\
  \ and his comrade Niaz Khan were shifted from Haripur central jail to Peshawar prison.\
  \ The transfer was against their wishes and both prisoners went on a hunger strike\
  \ in protest. Adnan used to be the prayer leader in the Haripur Jail and had a strong\
  \ influence over the prisoners. In 2011, Adnan and Niaz ensured that Eid was celebrated\
  \ on two different days in Haripur Jail, as per the custom in Khyber Pakthunkhwa\
  \ province, where majority of the rigid clerics do not celebrate Eid with the government.\
  \ As they refused to end their hunger strike, Adnan and Niaz were shifted to two\
  \ separate jails - Adnan was lodged in the Bannu Jail while Niaz was taken to the\
  \ Mansehra District Jail.Therefore, while Adnan was freed by the Taliban in the\
  \ 2012 Bannu jailbreak operation, Niaz stayed behind bars because of being in another\
  \ jail, only to be executed the other day. Adnan was freed on April 15, 2012 when\
  \ around 200 Taliban militants armed with guns, grenades and rockets attacked the\
  \ high-security Bannu Central Jail and released 384 prisoners. The then TTP spokesman\
  \ Ehsanullah Ehsan had subsequently declared on April 20, 2012 that the operation\
  \ was mainly aimed at freeing Adnan. Ehsanullah had added that the Taliban had been\
  \ working on the jailbreak plan for several months and that they had been in touch\
  \ with Adnan and some other prisoners in the Bannu Central Jail.Interestingly, despite\
  \ being an al-Qaeda linked convicted terrorist, Adnan was allowed to get married\
  \ in the jail in 2010 and become father of a daughter. Adnan Rasheed actually worked\
  \ for Amjad Farooqi, the al-Qaeda-linked Lashkar-e-Jhangvi terrorist who had engineered\
  \ the twin suicide attacks against Musharraf at the behest of al-Qaeda leader Abu\
  \ Faraj al Libi. Coming from Chota Lahore village of the Swabi district, Adnan had\
  \ joined the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in 1997, before being arrested for his role\
  \ in an attempt to kill Musharraf in Rawalpindi on December 14, 2003. He has already\
  \ been elevated as the chief operational commander of a lethal fidayeen unit of\
  \ TTP - Ansarul Aseer whose stated mission is to secure freedom for imprisoned jehadis\
  \ by conducting jailbreak operations. In a video-taped message released on March\
  \ 25, 2013, Adnan had threatened to assassinate Musharraf, adding that he has constituted\
  \ a death squad which would hunt down the former dictator for having ordered the\
  \ 2007 Lal Masjid massacre.Since his release, he has led several guerrilla operations\
  \ - the most significant being the July 30, 2013 Dera Ismail Khan jailbreak raid\
  \ in which 275 most wanted militants were freed. Almost a month before conducting\
  \ DI Khan raid, Adnan had claimed in a rare interview that he was indoctrinated\
  \ by a covert jehadi group which recruits officers from the three military services\
  \ and utilises them to wage jehad along with the Taliban. The interview was published\
  \ in the May 2013 issue of an English-language jehadi magazine \u201CAzan\u201D\
  \ which was launched by the Taliban elements, primarily to cater the educated Muslims.\
  \ Adnan had claimed that his first jehadi inclination emerged when the Indians were\
  \ compelled to release Maulana Masood Azhar after the 2000 hijacking of an Indian\
  \ plane. He said he was about to travel to Germany for higher education when the\
  \ 9/11 terrorist attacks took place and his colleagues in the PAF persuaded him\
  \ to pursue the jehadi path. In a latest development, while refuting the rumours\
  \ of his death in the ongoing military operation in Waziristan, Adnan Rasheed has\
  \ appeared in a video message [released on December 30, 2014], accusing the Pakistani\
  \ establishment of taking a U-turn after using militants in Jammu Kashmir and Afghanistan\
  \ and labeling them as terrorists. Following his trusted aide Niaz Mohammad\u2019\
  s execution the other day, the next PAF personnel to be executed for trying to kill\
  \ Musharraf is a former chief technician of the PAF, Khalid Mehmood who was associated\
  \ with 310 GC Wing and comes from Dunyapur area of the Lodhran district in Punjab."

  \ Punjab government has received overwhelming response to Chief Minister Apna Rozgar\
  \ Scheme as over 150,000 have applicants applied for the pick-up vans after two\
  \ weeks extension in the deadline. The deadline was extended after poor response\
  \ was due to some strict conditions regarding eligibility criteria as majority of\
  \ the applicants were unable to apply under the scheme. Initially, the Punjab government\
  \ had fixed November 28, 2014 last date for the submission of applications under\
  \ Apna Rozgar Scheme for providing pick-up vans to unemployed people in the province\
  \ on five-year long mark-up free payment plan. Realising lacklustre response of\
  \ people due to some conditions the criteria was later amended and last date extended\
  \ to December 15, 2014. For the applicants, age limit was fixed between 21 to 35\
  \ years in the matriculation qualification and valid driving licence issued on or\
  \ before October 31, 2014. The criteria was later amended as majority of the interested\
  \ applicants did not have valid driving licence, required academic certificate and\
  \ age. The government increased the age limit up to 40 years, no minimum education\
  \ and driving licence issued till last date of submission of applications, i.e.\
  \ December 15, 2014. The steering committee of Chief Minister Apna Rozgar Scheme\
  \ held a meeting after receiving applications from across the Punjab which was exceeded\
  \ to 150,000. As per the plan, the government has decided to give 50,000 vehicles.\
  \ However, more than 125,000 applications have been received for Suzuki Bolan against\
  \ the approved 25,000 vehicles and over 25,000 applications for Suzuki Ravi against\
  \ 25,000 vehicles. Out of every five applicants, one will get Suzuki Bolan vehicle\
  \ application while in Suzuki Ravi category, majority of the applicants will succeed\
  \ in getting vehicles even without balloting due to limited number of applications.\
  \ The members of the Steering Committee talking to The News confirmed that more\
  \ than 150,000 applications received under the Chief Minister Apna Rozgar Scheme.\
  \ It was decided that balloting of the applications should be started in the first\
  \ week of January, 2015. The committees would set up at the district and divisional\
  \ levels for the balloting of the applicants which would be completed by the first\

  \ Adulterated food\u2019s unchecked availability across the city has created serious\
  \ health issues for hundreds of thousands of people owing to the poor performance\
  \ of Punjab Food Authority (PFA) during 2014.The Punjab Food Authority (PFA), which\
  \ is the sole authority to enforce food-related laws in the provincial metropolis,\
  \ has completely failed to ensure its presence and protect the people from adulterated\
  \ and unhygienic food and edibles.During the year, the PFA checked 103,099 shops,\
  \ hotels, restaurants, marriage halls, water plants, manufacturing units and etc\
  \ out of which it sealed only 2,181 entrepreneurs putting a question mark on its\
  \ performance.The authority also issued notices to only 24,164 businesses for unhygienic\
  \ conditions and in most of the cases the businesses were back to the same state\
  \ of affairs after some hours or the next day. During the whole year, the authority\
  \ collected only 10,577 samples of various edibles which were far less than the\
  \ perceived targets. Despite a hue and cry over adulterated food especially grains\
  \ and spices not a single sample was taken from Akbari Mandi, the biggest grain\
  \ and spices market in the provincial capital.The action and campaign of the PFA\
  \ against water filtration plants also failed as it only issued licences to 281\
  \ such plants while others continued to operate without any checks and balances.\
  \ It is pertinent to mention that most of these unregistered water filtration plants\
  \ are supplying tap water to the citizens in the name of mineral water and many\
  \ of them are suffering from dangerous diseases especially different types of hepatitis\
  \ due to these water plants.Milk adulteration remained on top of all the food items\
  \ and the PFA again failed to ensure supply of hygienic and nutritious milk to the\
  \ citizens during the year. The authority collected 4,300 milk samples out of which\
  \ 2,604 were rejected due to presence of dangerous chemicals. However, supply of\
  \ milk containing formolime, urea and other hazardous chemicals continued in the\
  \ nook and corner of the city.During the year 2014, the authority also failed to\
  \ check and ensure purity in the Ramazan, Model and Sasta Bazaars. Statistics show\
  \ that during the last Ramazan, the authority closed down only 15 stalls in all\
  \ the Ramazan and Model Bazaars of nine towns during 3,039 raids. During these raids,\
  \ the PFA teams only confiscated 38 kg Baisan, 114 kg Ketchup, 32 liter juice, 18\
  \ kg ghee, 32 kg salt, 3 kg corn floor, 4 kg Chat Masala, 11 kg Bhally, 62 kg pulses\
  \ and 2,353 liter juice.During the year, adulteration in food items from milk to\
  \ beverages, bottled water, fruit and vegetable products, oil and fats, spices,\
  \ tea, sauces, sweetening agents and sweets and backing products went on unchecked\
  \ in the provincial metropolis. Both low and high-priced category edibles were no\
  \ exception and one could easily find adulterated and contaminated items in the\
  \ city."

  \         Karachi The year 2014 did not makes lives better for the people of Sindh\
  \ in terms of healthcare, and the provincial government stuck to merely making announcements\
  \ instead of actually starting new projects and facilitating the masses. Several\
  \ people died in Karachi of infectious diseases including dengue and Congo hemorrhagic\
  \ fever and the brain-eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, also claimed many lives.\
  \ The provincial health authorities, however, took no significant steps to improve\
  \ health facilities and the environmental conditions to control such outbreaks.\
  \ The battle with polio continued to suffer setbacks in the year as over two dozen\
  \ children were diagnosed with the disease, most of them in Karachi. The provincial\
  \ managers of the Expanded Program of Immunisation appeared helpless in eliminating\
  \ the disease. The provincial government\u2019s biggest failure was seen in Tharparkar,\
  \ where hundreds of children died of malnutrition and lack of basic health facilities.\
  \ Many women also lost their lives during childbirth.The government failed to provide\
  \ immediate and relief and avert the loss of lives in the drought-hit district.\
  \ The control of the health department returned to the Pakistan People\u2019s Party\
  \ after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement parted ways with the provincial government\
  \ and Jam Mehtab Dahar was appointed its minister replacing Dr Sagheer Ahmed in\
  \ October. The government announced several projects during the year to provide\
  \ more and better health facilities to the masses including five new medical colleges,\
  \ a rescue ambulance service, four blood transfusion centres with foreign funding\
  \ and seven thalassaemia centres, but none of these projects were started. The government\
  \ also announced that it would set up five new burns centres and an accident and\
  \ trauma centre but these projects could not kick off as well. The provincial budget\
  \ for the fiscal year 2014-15 contained allocations for the rescue ambulance service,\
  \ health call centres, a central diagnostic centre at the Civil hospital, expansion\
  \ of the OPDs at major hospitals in the province, a solar energy cold chain system\
  \ to maintain the efficacy of the vaccines and various other major and minor schemes,\
  \ but the government was unable to start working on them. In fact, the Benazir Bhutto\
  \ trauma and accident centre project, a project announced six years ago, could also\
  \ not be materialised this year. The provincial government had announced setting\
  \ up a major, tertiary-care hospital with 400 beds in Gulshan-e-Iqbal in Karachi.\
  \ But it failed to even perform its ground-breaking. Another area of neglect was\
  \ the promotion of medical education in the province. The previous coalition provincial\
  \ government of the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement had announced that it would\
  \ establish five new medical colleges and also laid their foundation stones. The\
  \ government had earmarked Rs1.14 billion for setting up these medical colleges\
  \ in Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Khairpur, Karachi and Hyderabad and they had to be completed\
  \ by 2014, but no headway was made in this regard too. The state of healthcare deteriorated\
  \ in the province, especially in Karachi, where three major hospitals were transferred\
  \ to provincial control after the 18th Constitutional Amendment. These services\
  \ at these hospitals suffered because of lack of attention, monitoring and funding\
  \ by the provincial government. The provincial government\u2019s inability to run\
  \ these hospitals can be gauged from the fact that it has recently announced privatising\
  \ the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, the National Institute of Child\
  \ Health and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. More than 5,000 patients died\
  \ during treatment at the JPMC alone during the outgoing year."

  \ believe that in the end Pakistan\u2019s success is my success, hence I am proud\

  , says Faysal Quraishi, GEO TV\u2019s blockbuster \u2018Bashar Momin\u2019s lead\
  \ actor. The year 2014 left us all reeling with shocks and a great sense of loss\
  \ over the greatest human tragedies in Lahore and then in Peshawar this country\
  \ had ever witnessed since its inception. However, for some of the homely citizens,\
  \ especially women, Geo TV did bring a little joy in the otherwise highly disturbed\
  \ general public with its epic family oriented blockbusters like Bashar Momin, Ikraar,\
  \ and many other spellbinding presentations. One of the most inspiring television\
  \ personalities, who outshined many others owning to GEO TV network\u2019s memorable\
  \ plays, remains the brilliant young actor Faysal Quraishi. Having started on a\
  \ high note, 2014 definitely turned out to be an exciting year for Faysal Quraishi.\
  \ His grand project Bashar Momin went on to become one of the most watched serials\
  \ of the year. The lavish sets, gripping storyline and Faysal\u2019s on-screen chemistry\
  \ with actress Ushna Shah, received acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Besides\
  \ doing many other glamorous TV shows, Faysal also starred in a serious TV play\
  \ named Adhuri Aurat which dealt with a sensitive topic of breast cancer. He became\
  \ the first Pakistani celebrity to launch his own smart phone application and remained\
  \ as one of the most popular morning show hosts through his show on a TV channel.\
  \ His show Ikraar, where he stars opposite Resham, is currently being aired on GEO\
  \ TV and receiving a great response. Along with other popular Pakistani TV shows\
  \ that were handpicked to be aired in India, Faysal\u2019s Mano Salwa (renamed Tere\
  \ Ishq Mein) and Meri Zaat Zara-e-Benishaan (renamed Kaisi Yeh Qayamat) were two\
  \ of the most popular viewed shows across the border. After winning accolades in\
  \ Pakistan, the shows were welcomed in India with the same enthusiasm and resulted\
  \ in receiving a lot of fans\u2019 mails and interview requests by faysal from there.\
  \ Speaking about the success of his shows in 2014, Faysal said \u201CI am humbled\
  \ by the love India\u2019s viewers have given not only to my shows, but to all of\
  \ our Pakistani shows. Unfortunately the Peshawar incident left me so shaken that\
  \ all the happiness had paled in comparison. I cannot stop thinking about what has\
  \ happened and cannot focus on any future projects right now, although I have very\
  \ exciting plans for the New Year initially. May God show mercy on our country and\
  \ keep us and our children safe. That\u2019s my only expectation from 2015\u201D\
  . Faysal Quraishi began his acting career at the tender age of six when he first\
  \ appeared in a PTV\u2019s play Emergency Ward. As a child he also appeared in the\
  \ drama, Andhera Ujala. At the age of 18 Faysal starred in a movie Saza. Four short\
  \ years and 19 films later Faysal Quraishi quit the movie industry and pursued a\
  \ career in the television drama acting instead. His first major appearance in the\
  \ TV acting was a role as Boota in Tooba Tek Singh. Faysal began acting in television\

text: "PTI regime to follow the Swedish governance model\nLAHORE: Premier Imran Khan-led\
  \ Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is reportedly going to follow the transparent governance\
  \ model of Sweden, which has the lowest levels of national debt, low and stable\
  \ inflation and a relatively healthy banking system among the European Union states,\
  \ research conducted by the \"Jang Group and Geo Television Network\" shows.Few\
  \ vital demographic and economic facts about Sweden: At 450,295 square kilometres,\
  \ Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area. Sweden has\
  \ a total population of 10.2 million, of which 2.4 million has a foreign background.\
  \ According to the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition, only\
  \ 30.7% of Swedes live in urban areas The total nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\
  \ of Sweden is over $601 billion, twice that of Pakistan!The nominal Swedish Per\
  \ Capita GDP is $58,345. Sweden is the 32nd largest export economy in the world.\
  \ In 2016, Sweden exported commodities totaling $133 billion and imported goods\
  \ worth $131 billion, resulting in a positive trade balance of $2.39 billion. In\
  \ 2016, Sweden had a tax-to-GDP ratio of 44.1% compared with the 36-member OECD's\
  \ average of 34.3% and compared to Pakistan's dismal 12.5 %. The enviable Swedish\
  \ road to success:According to Swedish government's official websites, the country's\
  \ economy used to suffer from low growth and high inflation, and the Swedish krona\
  \ was repeatedly devalued. Sweden was also hit by a deep financial crisis in the\
  \ early 1990s. Banks became unstable and two were nationalized, unemployment rose\
  \ rapidly, government spending got out of control, and so did Sweden\u2019s national\
  \ debt. The road back to stability and success was not easy for Sweden. But by pursuing\
  \ inventive and courageous reforms and sticking to them, Sweden has transformed\
  \ its economy and stayed strong in the face of the new global recession. Since the\
  \ crisis of the 1990s, successive Swedish governments have been balancing the budget\
  \ for over a decade, and have continued to do so even in the wake of the 2007\u2013\
  2008 global financial crises. Sweden reinvented its economic governance with a series\
  \ of innovative regulations. First, in 1996 a ceiling for government expenditures\
  \ was introduced. This was accompanied by the addition of the \u2018surplus goal\u2019\
  \ for the government budget. These reforms have met with broad support from across\
  \ the political spectrum in Sweden. They help ensure that high debt doesn\u2019\
  t accumulate and that debt isn\u2019t passed on to future generations.Additionally,\
  \ in 2007 the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council was established. This committee of experts\
  \ audits the government\u2019s policy decisions regarding public finances and aims\
  \ to ensure that they remain consistent with the goals of growth, employment and\
  \ long-term financial sustainability. The Swedish government\u2019s credible management\
  \ of the public finances has meant that Sweden remains in the top league of fiscally\
  \ responsible countries in Europe. While governments with large budget deficits\
  \ carry out austerity measures by increasing taxes and cutting public spending,\
  \ Sweden has avoided these difficulties. In fact, taxes in Sweden have actually\
  \ been lowered since the crisis began. Sweden has also continued to invest in areas\
  \ like healthcare, education and research, instead of having to cut heavily in these\
  \ areas like in some countries. Research shows that the parliamentary democracy\
  \ of Sweden has three levels of government: national, regional and local. Approximately\
  \ seven million people in the country entitled to vote in this Scandinavian nation\
  \ with thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes, along with vast boreal forests\
  \ and glaciated mountains. At parliamentary, municipal and county council elections\
  \ held every four years, voters elect those who are to decide how Sweden is governed\
  \ and administered.National level: At the national level, the Swedish people are\
  \ represented by the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) which has legislative powers.\
  \ Proposals for new laws are presented by the Government which also implements decisions\
  \ taken by the Riksdag. The Government is assisted in its work by the Government\
  \ Offices, comprising a number of ministries, and some 400 central government agencies\
  \ and public administrations. The Government implements the Riksdag's decisions\
  \ and draws up proposals for new laws or law amendments. There are many ways of\
  \ influencing Swedish politics, for example by taking part in referendums, joining\
  \ a political party or sending in your comments on reports presented by the Government.Regional\
  \ level: Sweden is divided into 21 counties. Political tasks at this level are undertaken\
  \ on the one hand by the county councils, whose decision-makers are directly elected\
  \ by the people of the county and, on the other, by the county administrative boards\
  \ which are government bodies in the counties. Some public authorities also operate\
  \ at regional and local levels, for example through county boards.Local level: Sweden\
  \ has 290 municipalities. Each municipality has an elected assembly, the municipal\
  \ council, which takes decisions on municipal matters. The municipal council appoints\
  \ the municipal executive board, which leads and coordinates municipality work.The\
  \ Constitution: Basic provisions defining how Sweden shall be governed are enshrined\
  \ in the Constitution. In these fundamental laws the relationship between decision-making\
  \ and executive power is set out and also the freedoms and rights enjoyed by citizens.\
  \ Among other things, the Instrument of Government guarantees citizens the right\
  \ to freely procure information, hold demonstrations, form political parties and\
  \ practice their religion.The Freedom of the Press Act: In another of the fundamental\
  \ laws, the Freedom of the Press Act, the principle of public access to official\
  \ documents is set out in order to guarantee an open society with access to information\
  \ about the work of the Riksdag, the Government and public agencies. This openness\
  \ entitles the Swedish people to study official documents. Anyone may avail him/herself\
  \ of this possibility whenever they wish.Division of responsibility between levels\
  \ of government: The Swedish Constitution contains provisions defining the relationship\
  \ between decision-making and executive power. The 1992 Swedish Local Government\
  \ Act regulates division into municipalities and the organization and powers of\
  \ the municipalities and county councils. It also contains rules for elected representatives,\
  \ municipal councils, executive boards and committees.The division of tasks between\
  \ central government and municipalities has changed over the years. Activities have\
  \ chiefly been transferred from central government to municipal bodies, inter alia\
  \ for democratic reasons. In municipalities it is easier to maintain continuous\
  \ contact between decision-makers and the private individual The Government has\
  \ appointed a parliamentary committee, the Committee on Public Sector Responsibilities,\
  \ which has been instructed to look into the division of responsibility between\
  \ different levels of government In addition, there is the European level which\
  \ has acquired increasing importance following Sweden's entry into the European\
  \ Union.The European level: On entering the EU in 1995, Sweden acquired a further\
  \ level of government: the European level. As a member of the Union, Sweden takes\
  \ part in the decision-making process when new common rules are drafted and approved.\
  \ Sweden is represented by the Government in the European Council of Ministers,\
  \ which is the EU's principal decision-making body.{C}{C}to assume charge as Governors\
  \ of Punjab. Till date since 1970, most of the Punjab Governors have hailed from\
  \ Pakistan People\u2019s Party and late Salman Taseer remains the only unfortunate\
  \ one to be assassinated in office. The post-1970 Punjab Governors (Acting and permanent)\
  \ include:Lt General Attiqur Rahman, Ghulam Mustafa Khar, Hanif Ramay, Nawab Sadiq\
  \ Hussain Qureshi, Mohammad Abbas Khan Abbasi, Aslam Riaz Hussain, Vice Chief of\
  \ Army Staff Lt. General Sawar Khan, Lt. General Ghulam Jilani Khan, Makhdoom Sajjad\
  \ Hussain Qureshi, Pakistan\u2019s former Army Chief General Tikka Khan, Mian Muhammad\
  \ Azhar, Chaudhary Altaf Hussain, Lt General Raja Saroop Khan, Khawaja Tariq Rahim,\
  \ Shahid Hamid, Zulfiqar Ali Khosa, Lt General Muhammad Safdar, Lt General Khalid\
  \ Maqbool, Salmaan Taseer, Rana Iqbal Khan between January 4 and January 13, 2011\
  \ after Taseer\u2019s assanination, Latif Khosa, Makhdoom Ahmed Mahmood, Chaudhary\
  \ Muhammad Sarwar, Rana Iqbal and Rafique Rajwana.There have been a few occasions\
  \ when Punjab was administratively controlled by Governors only. These were the\
  \ times of the Martial Laws of 1958-1972 and 1977-1985, and Governor Rules of 1999-2002.\
  \ In the case of Punjab, there was direct governor rule in 1949-1951, when the provincial\
  \ chief minister of that time was removed and assemblies were dissolved. Very few\
  \ people would know that covered by lush-green sprawling lawns, the Governor's House\
  \ Lahore was build around the tomb of Mohammed Kasim Khan (died 1635), a cousin\
  \ of the Mughal emperor Akbar. Kasim Khan, as chronicles of history reveal, was\
  \ a great patron of sports, and near his grave is a \"kushtee gumbaz\" or the dome\
  \ of the wrestlers.The famous \"Darbar Hall\" of the Governor's House Lahore found\
  \ its name after the Prince of Wales wanted to hold a darbar (open public court)\
  \ here. Hence, a magnificent room with a high oak ceiling and a balustrade balcony\
  \ running all round was built for the British Prince to hold a court. The balcony\
  \ of the \"Darbar Hall\" at Governor's House Lahore still has painted portraits\
  \ of the British administrators of Lahore."

text: "State and religion\n                            A pressing question facing\
  \ today\u2019s Pakistan is the relationship between religion and the state. Should\
  \ the state be subordinate to religion? Should religion be subordinate to the state?\
  \ Or should the two be separate?Subordinating the state to religion means making\
  \ political as well as economic and cultural institutions primarily an instrument\
  \ of the propagation and enforcement of a particular creed. Such a view makes the\
  \ state an ideological entity existing solely to serve a religious purpose.On the\
  \ contrary, making religion subservient to the state means that religion, like other\
  \ social institutions, is an instrument to protect and advance state interest \u2013\
  \ generally described as national interest. The profession of a creed may be prohibited\
  \ in the interest of the dominant political ideology or narrative.Keeping the state\
  \ and religion separate means that neither would the state prescribe or promote,\
  \ nor would public resources be used, in the service of a particular creed. Neither\
  \ would the followers of a specific faith be accorded preferential treatment nor\
  \ would those professing other creeds be discriminated against. The state would\
  \ be secular \u2013 without an official dogma or religion.Every polity has to answer\
  \ this question one way or another with far-reaching socio-political implications.\
  \ How has our society answered this question? To understand this, let\u2019s go\
  \ back to the genesis of the country.The partition of British India was done on\
  \ the basis of religion; there was no other ground: linguistic, ethnic, racial,\
  \ or geographic. Muslim majority regions made up Pakistan \u2013 the rest went to\
  \ India. But what precisely was the purpose of the creation of Pakistan? Was it\
  \ to put in place an \u2018Islamic\u2019 state in the narrow sense of the term?\
  \ Or was it to safeguard the political, economic and cultural rights of the Muslims\
  \ \u2018endangered\u2019 in a united India?To date, opinion has remained sharply\
  \ divided on such questions. The founders of the country, who on their part were\
  \ liberal and westernised if not secular as well, did from time to time make statements\
  \ on the raison d\u2019\xEAtre of what at that time was the largest Muslim state\
  \ on the map of the world. But they were not always consistent \u2013 and understandably\
  \ so. Even if they were consistent, the controversy might not have been sorted out.The\
  \ first real test came when the Constituent Assembly began to draw up the first\
  \ constitution of the country. One of the causes behind the inordinate delay in\
  \ constitution making was the debate on the place religion would hold in the political\
  \ system. The present constitution of Pakistan, following the previous basic laws\
  \ of the land, has sought to answer the question of the state-religion relationship\
  \ by making Islam the state religion and incorporating some other Islamic provisions.\
  \ For instance: Both the president and prime minister have to be Muslim; principles\
  \ of democracy, tolerance, freedom, equality, and justice, as enunciated by Islam,\
  \ shall be fully observed in the country; Muslims shall be enabled to fashion their\
  \ lives as per Islamic teachings; and no law will be made, or continue to be in\
  \ force, which is in conflict with the canons of Islam.At the same time, the constitution\
  \ guarantees religious freedom by giving every citizen the right to \u2018profess,\
  \ practise and promote his religion\u2019. But has the state-religion relationship\
  \ question been adequately answered?Pakistan remains an overwhelmingly Muslim society.\
  \ So on the face of it, making Islam the state religion seems quite logical. But\
  \ within Muslims there are sects and sub-sects having deep, and at some points irreconcilable,\
  \ doctrinal differences. Not only that, there are progressive and retrogressive,\
  \ liberal and narrow, modern and primitive, forward-looking and reactionary interpretations\
  \ of Islam. So in case religion is given a paramount place in the polity, the first\
  \ question is which creed or interpretation should reign supreme. One may refer\
  \ here to the report authored by the late Justice Munir Ahmed on the 1953 Punjab\
  \ disturbances occasioned by a religious movement, which led to the imposition of\
  \ martial law in the province. The Munir Report, as it is commonly called, on the\
  \ basis of the author\u2019s dialogues with some leading Muslim clerics of different\
  \ sects, notes that they can\u2019t even agree on the definition of a Muslim. Here\
  \ is a passage from the report: \u201CThe net result of all this is that neither\
  \ Shias nor Sunnis nor Deobandis nor Ahl-e-Hadith nor Barelvis are Muslims, and\
  \ any change from one view to the other must be accompanied in an Islamic state\
  \ with the penalty of death, if the government of the state is in the hands of the\
  \ party which considers the other party to be kafirs. And it does not require much\
  \ imagination to judge the consequences of this doctrine, when it is remembered\
  \ that no two ulema have agreed before us as to the definition of a Muslim...\u201D\
  Not surprisingly, a Deobandi is reluctant to offer prayers led by a Barelvi. A Shia\
  \ hesitates to go to a mosque that is run by Sunnis.By the same token, the social\
  \ values of Islam are susceptible to a variety of interpretations. Take, for example,\
  \ justice. Does it consist in expeditious trial of the accused followed by on-the-spot\
  \ punishment in case of conviction, as touted by the exponents of the jirga system\
  \ as well as the Taliban? Or does justice lie in following the lengthy due process\
  \ of law, as represented by the formal judicial system? What is the Islamic concept\
  \ of democracy? We follow essentially the Westminster model of parliamentary democracy\
  \ but our parliament is called \u2018Majlis-e-Shura,\u2019 which is at best a consultative\
  \ forum and not a supreme legislature. On a retrogressive interpretation, parliamentary\
  \ democracy, based on majority vote and party system, is \u2018un-Islamic\u2019\
  . On a liberal interpretation, there is no inherent contradiction between the two.Are\
  \ Islam and pluralism mutually compatible or exclusive? If they are compatible,\
  \ a variety of creeds can co-exist with full religious freedom and reciprocal toleration.\
  \ If they are mutually exclusive, only one creed is entitled to exist and the rest\
  \ should either be converted or wiped out, not simply as a matter of policy but\
  \ as a religious obligation. This is what the Taliban ideology, of which a significant\
  \ section of our society is enamoured, essentially is. The Taliban kill in the name\
  \ of God.By making Islam the official religion, the state has taken upon itself\
  \ the task of making people good Muslims. But who is a good Muslim? Is it he who\
  \ prays five times a day but has no qualms about murdering those who do not measure\
  \ up to his standards of a good Muslim? Is it he who earns his or her living by\
  \ hard work? Or is it he who is compassionate and kind to his fellows irrespective\
  \ of their creed?More than 97 percent of Pakistanis are Muslims; Muslims also occupy\
  \ key slots in government, business and industry. So Islam has never been in danger\
  \ in Pakistan. But religious extremism, coming from Muslims and not non-Muslims\
  \ and feeding on a diabolical ideology, is eating into society. It is time we pondered\
  \ where we went wrong in establishing our state-religion relationship.The writer\

  \ The establishment of the proposed military courts was challenged in the Supreme\
  \ Court on Wednesday by a non-government organisation. Petitioner Altaf Shakoor,\
  \ president of PASBAN, stated in his application that after the Peshawar killings\
  \ the government\u2019s decision to set up military courts when anti-terrorism courts\
  \ were also working for the same purpose. He said the only reason cited by the government\
  \ for setting up military courts was the \u201Cincrease in terrorist activities\u201D\
  \ though police and other law-enforcement agencies had failed to protect the lives\
  \ of citizens and control the law and order situation. The petitioner stated that\
  \ the personnel of police and other law-enforcement agencies were not trained like\
  \ the armed forces in dealing with terrorists. He said it was necessary to train\
  \ law-enforcement personnel effectively so that they act against criminal elements\
  \ send them to courts for punishment. He said the government instead of removing\
  \ deficiencies in the police and law-enforcement agencies had resorted to inducting\
  \ military courts supervised by army personnel and such action was tantamount to\
  \ running a parallel judicial system in the country which was not only a violation\
  \ of the constitution but was also lethal for the democratic system. He said the\
  \ role of law-enforcement agencies in arresting culprits involved in terrorism used\
  \ to criticise unfair treatment and false implication of citizens due to political\
  \ influence, adding that in case military courts depended upon investigation of\
  \ the police the very purpose of right of fair trial guaranteed under the constitution\
  \ would be seriously affected. The military courts had been declared illegal by\
  \ the Supreme Court and formation of these courts would be a violation of the court\u2019\
  s decision, he contended.He requested the court to bar the government from making\
  \ amendments in the constitution by declaring formation of military courts illegal."

  \     ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghanistan will kickstart negotiations to sign Preferential\
  \ Trade Agreement (PTA) in Islamabad from Thursday, January 1, 2015, in order to\
  \ jack up the bilateral trade up to $5 billion over the next three years, official\

  \ two-day deliberations in which Islamabad will make efforts to maximise its exports\
  \ in cement, agriculture products by seeking reduction in duty and taxes to Afghanistan,\u201D\
  \ the official sources said on Wednesday.Pakistan\u2019s exports of cement to Afghanistan\
  \ are witnessing declining trend in the recent months as Kabul is importing the\
  \ commodity from Iran.There are two factors involved in the decline in cement exports\
  \ to Afghanistan, as construction-related work is decreasing and Iranian brand of\
  \ cement is penetrating in the Afghan market, the sources said.\u201CIn order to\
  \ get our due share, Pakistan will seek waiver in duty and tariff structure on exports\
  \ of cement, as currently there is 10 percent duty on our exports, an official said.The\
  \ Afghan authorities will also demand starting negotiations on the revision of Afghanistan-Pakistan\
  \ Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) within 2015, as this agreement would exhaust after\
  \ five years.In 2003, India and Afghanistan had signed PTA that resulted in boosting\
  \ trade ties between the two countries.Now, Pakistan will also make efforts to sign\
  \ PTA with Afghanistan where Kabul would seek scaling down of the duty structure\
  \ on fresh and dry fruits.Pakistan had already granted such incentive to China and\
  \ other neighbouring countries so there was no harm in granting the same facility\
  \ to Afghanistan, the official added.When contacted, Federal Commerce Secretary\
  \ Muhammad Shehzad Arbab said the Pakistani side would submit its draft PTA to the\
  \ Afghan side and would seek their comments in order to boost trade ties between\
  \ the two countries.He said Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan would hold deliberations\
  \ on signing trilateral transit agreement on January 3 in Islamabad with clear cut\
  \ timeframe to move towards signing this agreement. However, the sources said the\
  \ APTTA will cease to exist after the lapse of five years in the coming few months.\
  \ The existing APTTA agreement states it will remain in force for five years from\
  \ the date it comes into force. The APTTA illustrates this agreement will automatically\
  \ renewed for a further period of five years thereafter subject to such modification\
  \ as may be agreed upon unless terminated by either contracting party.Pakistan desires\
  \ to include Tajikistan in APTTA after the lapse of this existing agreement with\
  \ effect from October 28, 2015.In the aftermath of the signing of APTTA between\
  \ Afghanistan and Pakistan in the last five years, the commercial trade (transit\
  \ and bilateral trade) and noncommercial (NATO-related trade) showed fluctuating\
  \ trends, as in the fiscal year 2009/10 the total trade was recorded at $3.332 billion\
  \ with the share of commercial trade ($2.157 billion) and noncommercial trade ($1.165\
  \ billion). In the fiscal year 2010/11, the commercial trade was recorded at $1.871\
  \ billion and noncommercial trade at $11.65 million. The commercial trade was recorded\
  \ at $1.256 billion in 2011/12 and noncommercial trade at $525 million, $1.319 billion\
  \ commercial trade and noncommercial of $564 million in 2012/13 and $2.202 billion\

text: "A capital storm\n                            A near-perfect storm is now swirling\
  \ around capital punishment in Pakistan where a seven-year old moratorium has recently\
  \ been lifted in the wake of the Peshawar tragedy. The EU is against the decision,\
  \ being an ardent supporter of abolishing capital punishment globally. In accordance\
  \ with a 2008 report, 137 countries had abolished death penalty in law or in practice\
  \ while the US, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan retained it and accounted\
  \ for 88 percent of the world\u2019s executions.In an indirect manner, some political\
  \ parties in the country are also whipping up opposition through objections to the\
  \ government\u2019s current efforts to institute military courts through an amendment\
  \ to the constitution for speedy justice. It is not difficult to see that such resistance\
  \ is not so much out of deference to human rights or any consideration for the constitution\
  \ of Pakistan, but out of fear that a combination of speedy trials and lifting of\
  \ moratorium would adversely affect their politics which so far have had a strong\
  \ streak of violence.The EU position is understandable; it saw Pakistan as a country\
  \ on the \u2018cusp\u2019 of abolishing the death penalty when former president\
  \ Asif Ali Zardari imposed a ban on executions in 2008. Recent developments have\
  \ reversed that status. The EU had invested much effort with the Zardari regime\
  \ through political arm twisting through the European Instrument for Democracy and\
  \ Human Right (EIDHR), matched by its mechanism of funding through the European\
  \ Commission. But Zardari was confused; on the one hand the government was imposing\
  \ a moratorium on capital punishment and at the same time promulgating the Prevention\
  \ of Electronic Crimes Ordinance which included \u2018cyber terrorism\u2019 in the\
  \ list of offences warranting the death penalty.In countries where the death penalty\
  \ situation is still in flux, EU has been striving for adherence to minimum international\
  \ standards \u2013 imposing capital punishment only for the most serious intentional\
  \ and violent crimes, not imposing it on anyone less than eighteen years of age,\
  \ pregnant women, new mothers, or persons with mental disorder. The standard requires\
  \ a fair trial where the defendant benefits from legal assistance and has recourse\
  \ to an appeal process. Also every endeavour is made that there is minimum possible\
  \ suffering while carrying out the punishment. But it has taken centuries for Europe\u2019\
  s civilisation to arrive at a stage where as a society it considers the death sentence\
  \ to be cruel, inhuman and irreversible and would like to abolish it for the sake\
  \ of human dignity and progressive development of human rights. Also historically\
  \ Europe has used a whole range of very painful methods to inflict death on convicted\
  \ prisoners which are too gory to be narrated here.It is audacious to think how\
  \ a punishment that snuffs out life out of an otherwise perfectly healthy body,\
  \ can be termed as causing less suffering than another, but certainly there is a\
  \ difference between hangings as per Pakistan\u2019s jail manuals which bring life\
  \ to a sudden end as opposed to some of the seemingly sophisticated methods in the\
  \ west. Earlier this year, Dennis McGuire, who was administered a lethal injection\
  \ in an Ohio jail writhed in acute and miserable pain for nearly fifteen minutes\
  \ before breathing his last.It is also interesting to note that in the past, most\
  \ of the offences for which the death sentence was awarded in Europe, were minor\
  \ compared to today\u2019s standards. It is only through a process of evolution\
  \ that the public mind in Europe accepts interning a mass killer like the Norwegian\
  \ Anders Breivik on an island for 21 years as punishment for killing 77 innocent\
  \ lives in 2011 \u2013 the highest in Norway for such offences \u2013 just over\
  \ three months for every person killed. Indeed life couldn\u2019t come have cheaper\
  \ in a society where it is otherwise so valued. Pakistan is relatively a nascent\
  \ state on the timeline of global civilisation. It inherited English jurisprudence\
  \ tailored to serve the purposes of erstwhile colonial masters when it came into\
  \ existence. Under the best of circumstances, we are never a very stable society\
  \ and governments of every hue have been found struggling to keep the crime rate\
  \ to a manageable level. Historically, the death sentence has never reduced the\
  \ crime rate to zero but it has helped lower it. Towards that end, capital punishment\
  \ in Pakistan had an element of fear for would-be offenders and acts as deterrence.\
  \ Over time, as societal turbulence increased, the number of offences punishable\
  \ by death has also risen but in spite of the heinous nature of the crime in some\
  \ cases, Pakistan has never violated the minimum international standards. Successive\
  \ governments, except for a brief period during General Ziaul Haq\u2019s rule, have\
  \ also kept capital punishments out of public view despite public pressure as is\
  \ being witnessed these days.The social fabric of today\u2019s Pakistan has been\
  \ ripped apart by a process started decades ago by former President Ronald Reagan\
  \ when he chose to fight the \u2018evil empire\u2019 in Afghanistan by dusting off\
  \ the concept of armed Islamic jihad and employing it as a weapon in the game between\
  \ superpowers. Terrorism refuses to die as was witnessed in Peshawar recently. That\
  \ element of fear which was meant for would-be offenders through the death penalty\
  \ has struck deep into the hearts of our mothers, sisters and children and has made\
  \ normal life impossible. This fear has to be taken out of our people and put back\
  \ into the hearts of those who perpetuate such heinous crimes. The citizens of Pakistan\
  \ deserve some peace of mind and if it is through capital punishments, let it be\
  \ so. A guiding principle for capital punishment enunciated by Prophet Muhammad\
  \ (pbuh) mentions only three offences \u2013 murder, illegal sexual intercourse\
  \ committed by a married person and apostasy. Pakistan\u2019s penal code, however,\
  \ prescribes death sentence for 27 different crimes which can perhaps be reviewed\
  \ downward in deference to global sentiments on the issue especially where crime\
  \ has been checked effectively. But any outright move to abolish capital punishment\
  \ will not only aggravate the law and order situation but also be a breach of the\
  \ country\u2019s constitution which declares that no law shall be enacted against\
  \ Islamic injunctions as stipulated in the Quran and Sunnah.The former chief justice\
  \ was recently asked why the conviction rate in the anti-terrorist courts was so\
  \ low to which he responded by admitting that when evidence falls short, the courts\
  \ have no option but to let the accused go free. This is a perfectly legal approach\
  \ but the question honourable judges should be asking themselves is whether doing\
  \ so always serves the ends of justice. Would justice be better served if in an\
  \ odd case of huge public interest, and where the judge is convinced beyond any\
  \ shadow of doubt that evidence has been intentionally left patchy during investigation\
  \ under pressure from the powerful, the judgements are in response to public expectations\
  \ and not a computerised outcome of the arguments in the courts?That said, the real\
  \ issue we should be looking at is that, as far as possible, no innocent should\
  \ be deprived of his life due to miscarriage of justice. Our existing legal system\
  \ is highly flawed where self-confessed criminals of major crimes roam about freely\
  \ and the innocent get punished. The EU would therefore do well to channel its EIDHR\
  \ support, complemented by European Commission funding, towards bringing about much-needed\
  \ jurisprudence infrastructure reforms in Pakistan rather than focusing on the moratorium\
  \ on the death penalty.The writer is a retired vice admiral. Email: [email\_protected]"

text: "Land record couldn\u2019t be computerised in 2014\n                       \
  \     LAHORETHE dream of completing a historical World Bank funded land record computerisation\
  \ project could not come true in the year 2014 despite tall claims made by Punjab\
  \ Chief Minister Mian Shahbaz Sharif in the said context. The first deadline to\
  \ complete the historical project was set for June 2014 and later December 2014\
  \ by the CM but computerisation of the land record could only be completed in 20\
  \ districts including Kasur, Sheikhupura, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Nankana Sahib,\
  \ Jhang, Jhelum, Lodhran, and Lahore out of total 36 districts of the province.\
  \ Similarly, around 12,500 muzaz out of total 23,000 were computerised in the year\
  \ 2014 in comparison with 2,500 muzaz which were completed in the year 2013. Besides\
  \ this, Arazi Record Centres have also been established in 143 tehsils of the province\
  \ during 2014 to provide further benefit to the masses. Now the project is expected\
  \ to be completed by June 2015. In those districts where the new system has started\
  \ working, any citizen can get the record of his piece of land in just 30 minutes\
  \ while transfer record can be made available within 50 minutes only. The computerisation\
  \ of land record has also made the process of getting \u2018Fard\u2019 more friendly\
  \ and the legal fee of Fard has also been reduced to Rs 150. It is expected that\
  \ when this modern system became fully functional in all the districts of the province,\
  \ the culture of corruption, bribery and forgery in the matters related to land\
  \ would be eliminated and the people would get rid of exploitative system of Patwaris\
  \ and Tehsildars. Due to computerisation of land record, the threat of theft and\
  \ loss of documents in fire or flood will also be minimised. It is pertinent to\
  \ mention here that the project \u2018Land Record Computerisation\u2019 was initiated\
  \ by Ch Pervaiz Elahi as a pilot project. The aim of the project was to get rid\
  \ the province of corrupt practices and irregularities of Patwaris and other revenue\
  \ officers. The project moved ahead very slowly every year. Designed by the Project\
  \ Management Unit, the project was recommended to the World Bank Board for funding\
  \ in 2006 and subsequently the Project Financing Agreement was signed on February\
  \ 28, 2007. During the previous era of incumbent PML-N\u2019s provincial government,\
  \ nothing tangible work could be done on the project and the project was delayed\
  \ further mainly because of delay in the software development and selection process\
  \ which was expected to be completed by the end of 2008. Similarly, implementation\
  \ of the project in four districts of the province, to be initiated in 2009, got\
  \ delayed. After the software development, the work on computerising the land record\
  \ got underway in the Punjab to facilitate more than 20 million land owners of the\
  \ province. To expand the Land Record Management Information Systems project in\
  \ the entire Punjab by CM Shahbaz Sharif was the other reason for the delay in the\
  \ completion of the project as initially the project was to be implemented in only\
  \ half of the districts of the province. Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad\
  \ Shahbaz Sharif presided over a high level meeting on Wednesday which reviewed\
  \ in detail the progress of the Land Record Management Information System. According\
  \ to a handout issued on Wednesday, addressing the meeting, the chief minister said\
  \ that the land record computerisation service centres had been made operational\
  \ in all the 143 tehsils of the province. He said through the computerisation of\
  \ land record issuance of proprietary deed had been ensured within 30 minutes which\
  \ would provide substantial relief to citizens as well as rid them of obsolete Patwar\
  \ Culture. He said the computerisation of land record had been completed in 20 districts\
  \ and online system at 92 service centres had been linked with a consolidated system.\
  \ He further said the process of Google mapping with regard to land had been completed\
  \ in three districts. The CM directed that the programme of Google mapping of the\
  \ land be extended to the whole province and an effective awareness campaign be\
  \ initiated regarding the importance of the project. He appreciated institutions\
  \ and authorities concerned over a speedy progress on the project and said it was\
  \ a public welfare project which would directly benefit the masses. The chief minister\
  \ issued instructions for setting up a steering committee to be headed by Member\
  \ Punjab Assembly Rana Sana Ullah and directed that the committee should submit\
  \ recommendations within seven days after reviewing matters pertaining to the launching\
  \ of the project of computerisation of urban land record, restriction on consolidation,\
  \ setting up of an authority with regard to permanent monitoring of the Land Record\
  \ Management Information System and other matters. The chairman planning and development\
  \ gave a detailed briefing on the pace of the project. Provincial Minister for Law\
  \ Mujtaba Shuja-ur-Rehman, Assembly Members Najaf Abbas Sial, Rana Sana Ullah, Dr.\
  \ Ayesha Ghous Pasha, Mian Tariq Mehmood, Qamar-ul-Islam, chief secretary, senior\
  \ member, board of revenue, chairman planning and development and officers concerned\
  \ were also present."

  \      ISLAMABAD: The government has finalised the process of appointments of heads\
  \ of public sector enterprises and statutory bodies which are running without regular\
  \ chiefs since the PML-N came to power, and has sent the report to Establishment\
  \ Division, according to Khawaja Zaheer Ahmed, special assistant to the prime minister.\
  \ After the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict of abolishing the commission constituted\
  \ for the appointment of heads of PSE, the government gave free hand to these institutions\
  \ for choosing a panel of suitable candidates for heading these institutions. The\
  \ apex court had set the deadline of December 31 for finalising the process and\
  \ submitting a report in this regard.Khawaja Zaheer Ahmed, head of the committee\
  \ constituted by the government for the appointment of heads of public sector enterprises,\
  \ while talking to The News said that the committee has completed the assigned task.\
  \ \u201CThe committee finalised its task today (Wednesday) and sent the report to\
  \ Establishment Division which would further proceed as per the court\u2019s verdict.\
  \ Out of 53 remaining PSEs only four companies i.e. Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Oil\
  \ and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL)\
  \ and Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) have asked for reviewing their panel\
  \ of candidates and sought some time which the committee granted,\u201D said Khawaja\
  \ Zaheer.The committee comprised former secretary law Barrister Zafrullah Khan,\
  \ Muhammad Zubair, secretary Establishment Division, secretary Cabinet Division\
  \ and the secretary of the relevant ministry.\u201CAfter reviewing the commission\u2019\
  s work and sensitivity of the matter, the committee in its initial report to the\
  \ government recommended that all the state-run enterprises which are being run\
  \ without a regular head should be given free hand to choose a suitable panel of\
  \ candidates to head them. We have told them to bring the panel of names to the\
  \ committee and then the committee would decide about the finalists and recommend\
  \ his name to the prime minister,\u201D he said.He said there is a minor change\
  \ in the process of appointment of heads of the state-run enterprises as earlier\
  \ the ministry used to send three names to the prime minister. However now the departments\
  \ concerned and ministries would bring these names to the committee and committee\
  \ would review them after which it would present its recommendations to the prime\
  \ minister.When asked about the reason for delay in the appointment process as the\
  \ government could appoint only five heads of the institutions so far, he said the\
  \ commission delayed the process as it failed to fulfill its task.\u201CThe commission\
  \ was fully authorised and was given a free hand but it failed as it could not hold\
  \ its meetings regularly. Due to the failure of the commission, the government has\
  \ to face criticism,\u201D he remarked.  He said the committee has made it clear\
  \ to all these institutions that they could re-advertise the positions if they want\
  \ to include eligible candidates in the list. However the final decision would be\
  \ taken by the committee after scrutinising the list of candidates.Five of 58 state-run\
  \ enterprises and statutory bodies got their chiefs already, whereas the process\
  \ of 15 organisations is under process, three departments have been dissolved or\
  \ devolved while cases of five institutions are pending in the court, he said. The\
  \ boards of National Investment Trust (NIT), Oil and Gas Development Corporation\
  \ Limited (OGDCL), National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), Utility Stores Corporation (USC),\
  \ Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM), Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Pakistan Railways\
  \ (PR), Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited\
  \ (SNGPL), State Life Insurance (SLI), Trading Corporation, Zarai Taraqiati Bank\
  \ Limited (ZTBL), Privatization Commission (PC), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL),\
  \ Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and all the electricity distribution companies are complete\
  \ now and are fully authorised to recommend a panel of names for heading these institutions."

text: "Ghani to keep a close eye on water board, SBCA, KDA, KMC\nKARACHI: Sindh\u2019\
  s local government minister has stressed the need to make major improvements in\
  \ the Karachi Water & Sewerage Board (KWSB), the Sindh Building Control Authority\
  \ (SBCA), the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation\
  \ (KMC).Talking to The News at his office, Saeed Ghani said he has recently taken\
  \ over the LG department, so for now he would review their performances and then\
  \ make appropriate changes. He said that at present the working of these bodies\
  \ is particularly unsatisfactory.Ghani said the recommendations provided by the\
  \ Supreme Court-designated judicial commission investigating the non-provision of\
  \ potable water, proper sanitation facilities and healthy environment to Sindh\u2019\
  s people would be implemented in letter and spirit.When asked to comment on Karachi\
  \ Mayor Wasim Akhtar\u2019s demand that the KWSB, the SBCA, the KDA and the master\
  \ plan department should be under the mayor, the LG minister said that such a demand\
  \ can only be met through amendments by the Sindh Assembly in the LG law.He said\
  \ the mayor can demand all he wants, but he has to seek the help of the provincial\
  \ legislature to have them met, adding that before making any demands, the mayor\
  \ should take a look at his performance.Ghani listed the deplorable conditions of\
  \ the city\u2019s parks and hospitals as well as the roads and streets that are\
  \ strewn with garbage as Akhtar\u2019s failings. He said the KMC is unable to generate\
  \ revenue, which shows how poorly the body is performing, so before criticising\
  \ the Sindh government, one should take a look at their own performance. The mayor\
  \ is unable to stop the rampant corruption in the KMC, added the minister.Ghani\
  \ asked what Akhtar and his Muttahida Qaumi Movement had achieved as regards the\
  \ Karachi Building Control Authority and the KWSB when his then party colleague\
  \ Mustafa Kamal was the city mayor.The minister said the provincial government gives\
  \ them Rs500 million a month to disburse salaries and the chief minister has provided\
  \ them with development funds. He asked if the mayor can show any development project\
  \ or other work on which these funds have been spent.Responding to a question regarding\
  \ the mayor\u2019s renewed demand of CM Syed Murad Ali Shah to provide him with\
  \ authority and funds, Ghani said Akhtar already has all the powers under the Sindh\
  \ Local Government Ordinance 2013.The minister said the people keep complaining\
  \ to him about the deplorable conditions of roads and streets across the city where\
  \ heaps of garbage have been dumped.He said that when the KMC had failed to lift\
  \ garbage and sought the help of Bahria Town Chairman Malik Riaz, he had helped\
  \ only because of former Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari, as he had quoted in\
  \ his speech that Zardari is his close friend and had asked him to help lift garbage\
  \ from District Central.A day earlier Ghani had rejected the claim of opposition\
  \ political parties that the provincial government\u2019s figure of offal removal\
  \ was exaggerated, and reiterated that 41,980 tonnes of sacrificial animal remains\
  \ were lifted and disposed of by Karachi\u2019s municipal agencies during the three\
  \ days of Eidul Azha.Addressing a news conference at the media cell of the Pakistan\
  \ Peoples Party, he said that around a million animals were sacrificed this Eidul\
  \ Azha across the metropolis in the areas that do not fall under the jurisdiction\
  \ of the different cantonment boards.Ghani said that according to the results of\
  \ the latest population census, Karachi comprises about three million families.\
  \ \u201CSome 33 per cent of the families living in the city sacrificed animals this\
  \ time, and the number of animals whose offal we lifted corresponds to this estimate.\u201D\
  He said that those with objections over the government\u2019s figure should object\
  \ to similar statistics of other cities. He added that some 44,000 tonnes of remains\
  \ were lifted in Lahore, so it is implausible that around 66 per cent of the families\
  \ living in Pakistan\u2019s second largest city sacrificed animals.The minister\
  \ said that in Peshawar around 9,500 tonnes of remains were allegedly disposed of,\
  \ meaning that up to 97 per cent of the families living in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019\
  s capital sacrificed animals.\u201CAccording to [Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Karachi\
  \ chief] Firdous Shamim Naqvi, the city\u2019s people sacrificed fewer animals than\
  \ the offal lifted. So, instead of questioning our very plausible figure, he should\
  \ challenge the number of Peshawar.\u201DGhani advised the leaders of the opposition\
  \ Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) that instead of embroiling themselves in an undue\
  \ controversy, they should at least check with the Central District Municipal Corporation\
  \ (DMC) chairman, who is affiliated with their own party.The minister said that\
  \ according to the figure provided by the Central DMC, some 437,000 animals were\
  \ sacrificed in District Central alone. He asked MQM leader Khawaja Izharul Hassan\
  \ to inquire about it from his party\u2019s local government representatives.Ghani\
  \ thanked the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar, chairmen\
  \ of the different DMCs, the Karachi District Council, other municipal agencies\
  \ and local government employees for their respective roles in the operation to\
  \ lift and dispose of offal and other remains of sacrificial animals.He claimed\
  \ that barring a few areas, the operation had been completed. He said that there\
  \ were a few complaints regarding the clean-up operation, but the overall sanitary\
  \ situation remained promising and would be improved further."
