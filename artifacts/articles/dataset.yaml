text: ' Smear campaign against Saleem Safi is unjustified Saleem Safi reported that
  Mian Nawaz Sharif had paid over Rs 6 million to the state exchequer for his personal
  expenses. This infuriated the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf s (PTI) supporters. They
  initiated a vicious campaign against him, calling him all kinds of names. He was
  described as a stooge of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), who has been
  receiving money from the Sharif family. However, Haroonur Rasheed defended him,
  though he didn t name him. He deplored that the PTI supporters had subjected the
  journalist to a campaign of vituperation. Those who know him will testify to the
  fact that he has never been anyone s stooge. He has never sang the praises of any
  ruler or leader. He has been a critic of Nawaz Sharif for the last four years, and
  earns enough money to not have to depend on PML-N handouts. In fact, he makes more
  money than the Army Chief and the Prime Minister (PM). However, he lives frugally.
  Regardless, those making these allegations did not hesitate for a second. It seems
  this society is going from bad to worse, but nobody is concerned. How the PTI chief
  got rid of Awn Chaudhry Saleem Safi wrote in an Urdu newspaper that Awn Chaudhry
  has been Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi s right-hand man and special confidant for many
  years. He used to be seen everywhere with Imran. I saw many PTI bigwigs kowtow to
  him. However, for some time we had been getting the impression that Imran wanted
  to get rid of him, but he was waiting for the appointment of his ADC. Awn was tasked
  with the drawing up of the guest list for the oath taking ceremony. Many PTI leaders
  were begging Awn to invitation cards until 2 AM. Surprisingly, at the ceremony he
  was conspicuous by his absence. Unexpectedly, instead of Awn Chaudhry, Zulfi Bukhari
  was seen with the First Lady. Upon meeting his military secretary, the new PM issued
  his first order:  Awn Chaudhry should not be seen anywhere near the Aiwan-i-Sadar
  or the PM s House.  Imran is the first person to become PM with people s power On
  August 18 a prominent TV news channel quoted PML-Q leader and former PM, as saying
  that Imran Khan is the first person who became PM with the people s power. He stated
  21 earlier PMs, including himself, were made by other powers. He went on to say
  that he himself  made  two PMs with his own hands. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry
  said that the recent clash with members of the Ahmedi community started over a cockfight
  and that it had no religious dimension Imran Khan worked hard for 22 years to achieve
  his mission. No earlier PM achieved this office through practical struggle. All
  of us should cooperate with him, so that he accomplishes his 22-year-old goal. It
  must be added that in 2002, Imran Khan had complained to the State Bank that Chaudhry
  Shujaat Hussain and Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi had gotten a loan of Rs 240 million written-off.  Ahmadi
  place of worship torched According to a report published in a prominent English
  newspaper on August 24, 31 people were injured and an Ahmadi place of worship was
  set on fire following a verbal spat between two groups of youngsters in Ghaseet
  Pura RB-69, a village near Faisalabad, on August 23. A youngster riding a motorcycle
  ran over a chicken belonging to an Ahmadi family, starting the conflict. Slogans
  were shouted, shots were fired, stones were pelted, and a nearby Ahmadi place of
  worship was damaged and set on fire   all in the presence of police officials. Jasarat,
  Jamaat-i-Islami s mouthpiece, reported on August 25 that as a result of an attack
  perpetrated by Ahmadis , one Muslim had been killed and 22 injured. Khalid Lateef
  Cheema, secretary general, Majlas-i-Ahrar, was quoted as saying that this incident
  was the result of promoting Qadianiyyat. While addressing a press conference, Information
  Minister Fawad Chaudhry said that the conflict started over a cockfight and that
  it had no religious dimension. Fazlur Rahman for breaking-off diplomatic relations
  with the Netherlands Maulana Fazlur Rahman, the chief of the JUI-F and the MMA,
  has said that by announcing the publication of blasphemous cartoons, the rulers
  of the Netherlands are playing with the sentiments of Muslim Ummah. This was published
  in a report in a notable Urdu newspaper. Fazlur Rehman called the competition  open
  terrorism  and demanded that Islamabad break-off diplomatic relations with the Netherlands.
  He went on to say the Islamic world should urge the UN to make laws to ensure that
  sacred personalities and religions are respected. Blasphemy against every prophet
  should be declared a crime and it should be punishable by death. He termed those
  organising this contest the biggest enemies of the Islamic world. Islamic countries
  should break their silence and take a brave stand in this regard. Islamabad, get
  ready for another Tehreek-i-Labbaik sit-in Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik
  Pakistan (TLP) Chief, has announced that his party will hold a long march from Lahore
  to Islamabad over the exhibition of blasphemous cartoons in the Netherlands. This
  was in a report published on August 27. The march will start on August 29 and will
  become a sit-in upon reaching Islamabad. The sit-in will continue until Pakistan
  does not break off all kinds of diplomatic relations with the Netherlands. Rizvi
  has demanded the expulsion of the Netherlands  ambassador and has urged the UN and
  other global institutions to give up their old traditions and play their role in
  get the publication of cartoons stopped. The writer has studied international relations
  in Islamabad and media in London. He has worked for several English-language newspapers.
  He has written a book, Handbook of Functional English, for the benefit of those

text: ' I am a Pakistani-American, one who straddles two distinct cultures. Living
  in both Pakistan and America, my take home lesson about politics in both countries
  is this; the power systems on both sides have the ultimate power over all that matters.
  In July, there was an opinion piece published in the New York Times, which alleges
  that the powerful establishment led by the Army in Pakistan has always created a
  king s party to further their agenda and smash the party the establishment didn
  t like. The author goes on to suggest based on-for lack of a better word-whim, that
  PTI is the King s party today. Most of the noise on social media is made by the
  PTI stalwarts   who obviously deny being the King s party   and those journalists,
  anchors, and book authors who regard the Times article as a Godsend for their ritualistic
  Imran Khan bashing. On social media, they are usually referred to as lifafa journalists.
  The Times article is interesting not for what it says, but for what it doesn t say.
  Conspicuous by its absence from the Times article is the issue of campaign finance
  in American elections. All cultures and races have different versions of the same
  thing. Some are visible to the naked eye, others can only be seen with eyes closed.
  In America, the caucasians smoke Marlboro lights while African-Americans smoke menthol
  cigarettes. Pakistani doctors drive BMWs or Mercedes and so do the Arabs, who smoke
  shisha with their food, while Pakistanis drink black tea with theirs. The point
  is that everyone has a unique manner of doing things. In America, I have worked
  at gas stations and have taught at colleges. I have dealt with people stealing soda
  cans and I have also sat down one on one with Noam Chomsky. Having seen many layers
  of American society, I know that America too has King s parties. The Republican
  and the Democratic parties are King s parties. Their Kings are the rich corporations.
  Having seen many layers of American society, I know that America too has king s
  parties. In fact, both Republican and the Democratic parties are kings  parties.
  Their kings are the rich corporations The role of money is not new in American politics.
  However, in the wake of the US supreme Court decision in the Citizens United v FEC
  case in 2010, it has become legal for unlimited cash to manipulate American elections.
  In the 5-4 court decision, the majority opinion argues that corporations have the
  same First Amendment rights as individuals. Political Action Committees (PACs) existed
  before with some limitations on their donations. But Citizens United case paved
  the way for Super PACs with virtually no limitations on the size of donation to
  a candidate during an election campaign. The new normal is for corporations to drench
  the election campaign with massive amounts of cash using Super PACs to influence
  elections. Positive campaign ads for the blue eyed candidate are aired, while at
  the same time malicious ads are aired targeting the opponent. The candidate with
  more money at his disposal usually wins. The winner then has to put his weight behind
  the kind of legislation that will help the  sugar daddy  corporation. The vicious
  cycle goes on. In the meantime, the biggest losers are the American public and the
  American democracy. The only winner is the King. The people s speech is just words
  while the corporations  speech is cash. Guess who is going to win, cash or words?
  Many Super PACs make hefty donations to election campaigns of the Republicans, the
  party that worships the Second Amendment right: the right to bear arms. The National
  Rifle Association (NRA) spends a stupendous amount of money in creating  awareness  about
  the importance of self-defense and the Second Amendment. The irony is that gun violence
  claims more American lives than terrorism, yet the Super PACs supporting gun rights
  are not deemed dangerous.  The National Rifle Association spends a stupendous amount
  of money in creating  awareness  about the importance of self-defence and the Second
  Amendment. The irony is that gun violence claims more American lives than terrorism
  According to a 2016 study by Alex Nowrasteh at the Cato Institute, about 3,024 Americans
  have died from 1975 through 2015 due to foreign born terrorists. This number includes
  the 2,983 deaths from 9/11. In the same period, guns claimed 1.34 million American
  lives. That s about as many Americans as died in all the wars in American history
  since the American Revolution. Notwithstanding, the mindset is: foreign terrorists
  are more dangerous than the domestic shooter. Similarly, domestic buying of the
  White House, which I will discuss shortly, isn t considered detrimental to American
  democracy. However, foreign (Russian) meddling to influence the election outcome
  is deemed a more sinister plot to harm America and its democracy. Strange logic!
  In 2008, Obama raised roughly $750 million. In 2012, Obama raised $1.123 billion,
  while Romney raised $ 1.019 billion. Every subsequent election is costlier than
  the previous one. The 2008 election spending was $5.3 billion, $6 billion in 2012,
  and $6.6 billion in 2016. American Kings have their free speech and their favorite
  party. The interesting part is that they don t even hide in plain sight. It is deeply
  internalised that money is needed for campaigns and corporations  free speech ought
  to be respected. I would like to point out that Pakistani Kings try their best to
  hide, knowing full well that Pakistanis know what the truth is. American Kings don
  t have to hide because they have blunted the free speech of the American people
  by controlling their minds. That is a more sinister plot than the one that encourages
  a party   called the King s party.   The writer is currently a PhD candidate at
  the University of Houston, and he teaches political science at the Lone Star College

text: 'In 1994, when the Taliban burst upon the scene in Kandahar there was a reluctant
  recognition in Pakistan, that given their astonishing success they could perhaps
  bring peace to Afghanistan at a time when Pakistan s efforts to mediate peace between
  the Afghan factions had failed. This was when the Americans had walked away from
  the region and when other regional powers appeared intent on supporting the factions
  they favoured, caring little for the overall stability of the country. It was also
  when the Mujahideen were busy wreaking greater destruction on Afghanistan than it
  had suffered during the decade long Soviet occupation. We were not alone in this.
  Similar hopes were entertained by the Americans who also sought advantages from
  Afghanistan s location. Our hopes were belied. The Northern Alliance continued to
  hold territory in the North and this rump regime enjoyed recognition and support
  from India, Iran and Russia. The world worried about the Al-Qaeda presence in Afghanistan.
  This was the situation when New York was attacked and a multi flawed US operation
  began The following mistakes   certainly not a comprehensive list   that the Americans
  made in Afghanistan justifiably aroused suspicions and misgivings about their intentions.
  First, in 1996, when Taliban control over a large part of Afghanistan had been consolidated,
  they allowed Bin Laden to fly to Afghanistan from Sudan. In Sudan he was under the
  careful eye of a Sudanese government anxious to keep on the good side of the Americans.
  In Afghanistan, he was revered as a hero of the Jihad in which the Taliban leaders
  had participated as foot soldiers. Second, in their relentless search for Al-Qaeda,
  the US resurrected the warlords, who had gone under cover during the Taliban rule,
  and handed over generous amounts of dollars. They turned a blind eye to the resumption
  of poppy cultivation that had virtually disappeared in the last year of Taliban
  rule. Moreover, they picked up and took to Guantanamo many innocent Afghans fingered
  by these warlords as part of personal vendettas or as part of the struggle for influence
  in their area of operation. Third, they failed to use their own troops to eliminate
  Bin Laden and his followers when they were trapped in Tora Bora. Instead, they relied
  upon Afghan mercenaries with the predictable consequence that either by bribery
  or by devotion, these Afghans permitted Bin Laden to cross into Pakistan and saddled
  us with the problem. Our role in the GWOT was to cleanse our own territory of terrorist
  groups, a task we would have had to undertake eventually Fourth, they convened a
  Bonn Conference from which the Taliban and most Pashtuns were excluded, making intentionally
  or otherwise, the Taliban the representatives of Pashtun nationalism.  Fifth and
  most importantly, they rejected or forced Karzai to reject the Taliban offer to
  return to Afghanistan and live as ordinary citizens in return for amnesty. Sixth,
  they did this as part of a larger scheme to remake the Middle East. They were planning
  a war on Iraq and diverting resources and political attention from Afghanistan.
  Common sense would have dictated that if resources were no longer available for
  Afghanistan, the Taliban should have been granted the amnesty they sought and reduced
  American involvement in Afghanistan to the rebuilding of a country that had been
  more devastated by internecine warfare than by the years of Soviet occupation. Much
  could have been different if the Americans had behaved differently. The important
  point however is that apart from the assistance we provided to the Americans for
  their plans in Afghanistan   our part in the Global War of Terror was to cleanse
  our own areas   a task we would have had to undertake irrespective of what the Americans
  did or did not do in Afghanistan. This was our war and in many ways independent
  of the war waged in Afghanistan. How did our areas become hotbeds of extremism?
  This was at least partly the direct result of the policy of our rulers of the day.
  We had, along with the Americans and then the Saudis and others supported the Afghan  freedom
  fighters  in their struggle against the Soviet occupation. General Ziaul Haq, our
  ruler at that time was anxious to ensure the consolidation of his version of Islam
  in Pakistan. He wanted to use the Afghan Jihad for this purpose. Therefore, he decided
  that the Jihad was to be waged with the slogan of  Islam in Danger  rather than
  the mildly offered American suggestion supported by some of the Mujahideen that
  the deposed King Zahir Shah be brought back from Rome and under his leadership the
  slogan of  Afghan nationalism  be used. The Americans were in this game only to
  impose on the Russians the same humiliation that the Vietnamese had inflicted on
  the Americans. They were prepared to let us determine how this war was to be waged
  and to help us with such things as bringing extremists, among them Osama Bin Laden,
  from all parts of the Muslim world to Peshawar to wage a Jihad against the infidel
  Soviets alongside their Muslim Afghan brothers. We set up this chain of Madaris
  along our border to train Afghans, and unfortunately Pakistanis for the Jihad; and
  entrusted their running to Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the JUI. The Americans then
  helped us devise curricula for the Madaris and this included gems such as an arithmetic
  book which taught addition by saying  One Kalashnikov plus three Kalashnikovs is
  equal to 4 Kalashnikovs . They were prepared to go along with whatever we proposed
  with regard to the many Afghan Mujahideen groups that existed at that time and to
  let us determine the level of assistance each would receive. In one fell stroke,
  we reduced the 29 Afghan parties that existed to seven and decided that of them
  Gulbuddin Hikmatyar s Hizbe Islami (a largely Pashtun Party) rather than Rabbani
  and Ahmad Shah Masood s Jamiate Islami (a largely Tajik party) would be the principal
  recipient of assistance. We were in this Jihad, as the tail that wagged the dog,
  and when the results of our efforts produced not just the Soviet withdrawal from
  Afghanistan but the disintegration of the Soviet Union, there was this heady feeling
  of invincibility in our policy circles. What did we gain? We could complete the
  work needed to ensure a working nuclear weapon capability while the Americans turned
  a not so blind eye towards this development but for the rest we have only loss to
  show for our efforts. This I will dilate on in my next column. Concluded The writer

text: "LAHORE, Dec 11: Calling for an end to discrimination against industry in Punjab,\
  \ industrial associations have demanded that the distribution of gas must be in\
  \ accordance with the industry size and not according to the area of a province.The\
  \ All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) and the Pakistan Steel Re-Rolling\
  \ Mills Association (PSRMA) were unanimous in apprehending that non-availability\
  \ of gas for the next three months would render millions of workers jobless and\
  \ aggravate the law and order situation. Aptma Punjab Chairman SM Tanveer said,\
  \ at a news conference here on Wednesday, non-availability of gas would render at\
  \ least three million people jobless who had been directly or indirectly earning\
  \ their livelihood from the industry.According to PSRMA Chairman Asmat Pervaiz Malik,\
  \ the gas suspension will result in the closure of 28 dependent industries of the\
  \ steel sector that get raw material from the re-rolling industry. \u201CThe worst-hit\
  \ industries will include agricultural implements, sewing machines, surgical instruments,\
  \ tractor spares, powerlooms, electric fans and appliances, light engineering, housing\
  \ and construction,\u201D said Mr Malik. He said the government was claiming to\
  \ create employment opportunities on the one hand but implementing the policies\
  \ that were depriving people of their jobs on the other.The Aptma leader said the\
  \ gas suspension would result in a loss of $3 billion foreign exchange to the country\
  \ in particular and the textile industry in general.\u201CThe industry has a capacity\
  \ to increase textile exports to $26 billion from the present $13 billion in five\
  \ years, provided the uninterrupted gas supply is ensured. The industry has asked\
  \ for the provision of 100mmcft of gas supply for the next three months against\
  \ its daily demand of 400mmcft,\u201D said Mr Tanveer. \u201CWithin two years, trade\
  \ deficit can be brought down to zero and inflation and price hike can be controlled\
  \ if the government patronises textile industry by adopting the Aptma strategy.\u201C\
  Economic development cannot be ensured without strengthening the industry. There\
  \ will be no need to approach the IMF if uninterrupted energy supply is ensured\
  \ to the textile industry,\u201D he said."

  \ northern Syria after Islamist fighters seized Western-backed rebel weapons warehouses,\
  \ highlighting fears that supplies could end up in the wrong hands and the general\
  \ chaos engulfing the nation.The rebel Free Syrian Army fighting President Basharal-Assad\
  \ said the US and British moves were rushed and mistaken. \u201CWe hope our friends\
  \ will rethink and wait for a few days when things will be clearer,\u201D FSA spokesman\
  \ Louay Meqdadsaid.The suspension underlines a crisis for the FSA leadership which\
  \ needs international backing to reinforce its credibility and to stop its fighters\
  \ joining powerful Al Qaeda-backed Islamist militants who now dominate the war with\
  \ Assad.The United States and Britain have in the past offered radios, body armour,\
  \ medical supplies, money and food to rebels fighting Assad, but a US embassy spokesman\
  \ in Turkey declined to give details of what supplies may have been halted.Fighters\
  \ from the Islamic Front, which groups six majorrebel brigades and which said last\
  \ week it had quit the FSA, seized headquarters of the Syrian Military Council,\
  \ nominally in charge of the FSA, and weapons warehouses at the Bab al-Hawa crossing\
  \ on Syria\u2019s north western border with Turkey.The Syrian Observatory for Human\
  \ Rights, a British-based anti-Assad monitoring group, said the Islamic Front had\
  \ seized dozens of \u2018Shilka\u2019 anti-aircraft weapons and anti-tank rockets\
  \ from the SMC arms stores in fighting on Friday and Saturday.The Islamic Front\u2019\
  s battlefield success in capturing the weapons stores could undermine SMC assurances\
  \ to the United States that no supplies sent to their fighters would fall into the\
  \ hands of Islamist brigades.The US embassy spokesman in Ankara said the situation\
  \ was being investigated \u201Cto inventory the status of US equipment and supplies\
  \ provided to the SMC\u201D.\u201CAs a result of this situation the United States\
  \ has suspended all further deliveries of non-lethal assistance into northern Syria,\u201D\
  \ the spokesman said.Five rebel fighters were killed in the clashes at Babal-Hawa\
  \ but it was not clear which side they were on.REBELS PLAY DOWN INFIGHTING: American\
  \ aid, including trucks, ambulances and \u201Cmeals ready to eat food\u201D, reaches\
  \ Syria overland through Turkey.US officials said in the summer that they had developed\
  \ a system of distribution using SMC operatives that would ensure the aid reached\
  \ US-allied groups. The United States has been concerned the non-lethal aid should\
  \ not reach Islamists.A senior US administration official said that the suspension\
  \ should not be misinterpreted.\u201CThis is absolutely not the beginning of the\
  \ US washing its hands. We will remain engaged in the humanitarian effort, we will\
  \ remain engaged in the diplomatic effort,\u201D the official said, adding: \u201C\
  This doesn\u2019t represent a change in policy in our support for the moderate opposition.\u201D\
  \ He said the administration was looking for other ways to see how the support can\
  \ be provided to ensure it does not fall into the hands of \u201Cextremists\u201D\
  .The British wanted the situation clarified after the clashes. \u201CWe have no\
  \ plans to deliver any equipment while the situation remains so unclear. We will\
  \ keep this under close review,\u201D a spokesman from the British embassy in Ankara\
  \ said.Turkey shut its side of the border crossing in Hatay province, customs sources\
  \ said, citing a reported increase in clashes on the Syrian side. There was no immediate\
  \ confirmation from Turkish officials.Wednesday\u2019s announcement does not affect\
  \ humanitarian support because this is distributed through aid groups and the United\
  \ Nations. The first UN relief airlift to Syria from neighbouring Iraq will deliver\
  \ food and winter supplies to the mostly Kurdish north-east over the next 10 days.The\
  \ 2-3/4 year conflict has killed more than 100,000 people, driven more than two\
  \ million abroad as refugees and left many millions more dependent on aid.Playing\

text: "ISLAMABAD, Dec 11: On the last day of his eight-year tenure on Wednesday, Chief\
  \ Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry took up the Balochistan missing persons\u2019\
  \ case and handed down an order. The proceedings of the case saw a verbal clash\
  \ between a counsel and the bench. Heading a three-judge Supreme Court bench which\
  \ had issued a contempt notice to Inspector General of Frontier Corps Balochistan\
  \ Maj Gen Ijaz Shahid, the chief justice ordered that the next-in-command in the\
  \ force be immediately appointed in place of the FC chief who was indisposed and\
  \ admitted to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology. When Brigadier Khalid Saleem,\
  \ who is at present heading the force, tried to explain that none of the missing\
  \ persons was in the FC custody, the court said that without a proper notification\
  \ by the interior ministry about his charge he could not be considered to be legally\
  \ holding the command. After the notification, the order said, the acting FC chief\
  \ would ensure that the FC personnel allegedly involved in enforced disappearances\
  \ appeared before DIG of Balochistan Crime Investigation Department Imtiaz Ahmed\
  \ Shah in compliance with the earlier order. It said the new FC chief, along with\
  \ the provincial police and other law-enforcement agencies, would also ensure recovery\
  \ of the missing persons, including Advocate Mir Ahmed Marwani who had been picked\
  \ up from Khuzdar in Balochistan. The new FC chief, the Balochistan chief secretary\
  \ and the inspector general of police are required to appear before the Supreme\
  \ Court on Dec 17 along with reports on progress in recovery of the missing persons.\
  \ The court said that since former FC chief Obaidullah Khattak had earlier given\
  \ an undertaking in the court, all those who had affixed their signatures on the\
  \ commitment to recover the missing persons would also appear before it to explain\
  \ whether they had met the commitment. The court regretted that despite protests\
  \ by relatives of the missing persons, no-one took practical steps to redress their\
  \ grievances. This is evident from the attitude of law-enforcement agencies as well\
  \ as elected representatives who had promised to enforce fundamental rights in their\
  \ election campaigns. \u201CSimilar is the position of the federal government, the\
  \ prime minister and his cabinet as well as the elected representatives, particularly\
  \ from Balochistan, despite the fact that they are aware of the miseries of the\
  \ Baloch people,\u201D the court said. It observed that it was a responsibility\
  \ of the executive authorities discharging functions under the constitution to enforce\
  \ fundamental rights. The court regretted that there had been a hue and cry for\
  \ many years and relatives of the missing persons were continuously holding camps\
  \ in Quetta and even marched to Karachi on foot with their children, women and the\
  \ elderly demanding their recovery. ACRIMONY: At the outset of the proceedings an\
  \ exchange of words took place between the bench and Advocate Irfan Qadir, representing\
  \ FC chief Maj Gen Ijaz Shahid. When Mr Qadir, a former attorney general, insisted\
  \ that he should be heard, the court said that the right of audience could not be\
  \ granted until the FC chief himself appeared to face the contempt charge. He quoted\
  \ a headline in a section of the press that a \u201Cpolitical superstar is born\u201D\
  \ and said that if it was true he would not like to leave his client at the mercy\
  \ of the superstar. And if it was wrong, he said, the court should proceed against\
  \ the media house under Section 8 of the Contempt of the Court Ordinance 2003 so\
  \ that such stories were not published again. The court asked the counsel not to\
  \ force it to take strict action against him. Otherwise, it warned, he could be\
  \ charged for committing contempt at the face of the court under the Supreme Court\
  \ Rules which could entail suspension or permanent cancellation of his licence to\
  \ practice in the Supreme Court. Mr Qadir said he had not committed any contempt\
  \ and all that he wanted was an action against the newspaper. He alleged that the\
  \ bench was sitting with a mindset and getting personal. The court said it was exercising\
  \ restraint and asked the counsel not to be loud in the court. Now it has become\
  \ a question of the dignity of the court. At this Attorney General Muneer A. Malik\
  \ stepped in to request the court to exercise judicial restraint since Mr Qadir\
  \ was his predecessor. The chief justice observed that the power to suspend a licence\
  \ could be exercised by the chief justice straightaway. But the counsel said the\
  \ court could not go ahead or even revoke his licence without hearing him and emphasised\
  \ that the Supreme Court rules were subservient to Article 10-A of the Constitution\
  \ which ensures fair trial. But despite the expectation after intervention by the\
  \ attorney general, Mr Qadir did not offer any remorse or apology, but only demanded\
  \ fair trial from the bench. Detainees\u2019 death: In its Tuesday\u2019s judgment\
  \ in the Adiyala Jail detainees case, the Supreme Court had declared that the death\
  \ of four detainees during custody could not be proved to have been caused by torture,\
  \ thus their death should be considered as natural. The judgment said: \u201CRegarding\
  \ the death of the 4 detainees, the respondents No. 2 to 4 with their reply (CMA\
  \ No. 487 of 2012) have attached their death certificates which show that Syed Abdus\
  \ Saboor expired on 20.01.2011 in LRH due to cardio pulmonary arrest, respiratory\
  \ distress. Tehseenullah expired on 17.12.2011 in LRH due to cardio pulmonary arrest.\
  \ Said Arab expired on 18.12.2011 in LRH due to cardio pulmonary arrest, secondary\
  \ to anaemia and pancyctopaeshia. Muhammad Aamir alias Khalid expired on 13.08.2011\
  \ due to acute renal failure and acute gastroenteritis.\u201D"

  \ with the opposition to resolve an election standoff.The phone calls stepped up\
  \ diplomatic pressure on Bangladeshi leaders to find a solution to the stalemate\
  \ amid a worsening of political violence that has left nearly 80 people since late\
  \ October.\u201CJohn Kerry emphasised (the need for) continuous talks between the\
  \ two parties,\u201D and said that the US \u201Cexpects a peaceful solution\u201D\
  \ to the stalemate, Hasina\u2019s spokesman Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury told reporters.\u201C\
  Kerry said all should refrain from violence and seek a political consensus through\
  \ dialogue so the upcoming election could be held peacefully,\u201D Chowdhury said.Ban\
  \ also called Hasina, expressing his hopes for dialogue to end the row that has\
  \ plunged the country into crisis, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said.The\
  \ UN assistant secretary for political affairs, Oscar Fernandez Taranco, who wound\
  \ up a visit to Bangladesh on Wednesday confirmed the phone calls by the world\u2019\
  s top diplomats.The calls came after officials from the country\u2019s ruling Awami\
  \ League party and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) held one-to-one\
  \ talks for the first time in years in a bid to defuse the row.BNP and its smaller\
  \ Islamist allies have said they will boycott the Jan 5 polls and have called a\
  \ series of crippling strikes and transport blockades.Some 77 people have died in\
  \ clashes since late October when the BNP-led 18-party opposition movement launched\
  \ the protests calling on Hasina to resign and make way for the polls under a neutral\
  \ caretaker government.The opposition, led by Hasina\u2019s rival Khaleda Zia, has\
  \ said it fears the premier will try to rig the vote in a country plagued by coups\
  \ and political upheaval for decades.Hasina has rejected the demands for her resignation\
  \ and is determined to hold the polls as scheduled, insisting it is a constitutional\
  \ requirement.Observers said although the two parties have held two rounds of talks,\
  \ decades of distrust mean it is unlikely a deal is immediately in the cards.UN\
  \ envoy Fernandez-Taranco said a third meeting between the parties has been agreed\
  \ but more must be done to build confidence.\u201CThere are measures that would\
  \ contribute immensely: a call by all sides to end the violence, release of opposition\
  \ political leaders and a mutually satisfactory solution to concerns regarding the\
  \ election schedule,\u201D he told a press briefing.\u201CThe leaders have shown\
  \ statesmanship. It remains critical to reduce tension and to continue to engage\
  \ in constructive dialogue so as to create a congenial atmosphere.Hasina\u2019s\
  \ plan to go ahead with the polls without the BNP suffered a major blow last week\
  \ when her key ally \u2014 the Jatiya Party, the third-largest political organisation\
  \ in the country, led by ex-military dictator Hussain Muhammad Ershad \u2014 announced\
  \ it would also boycott the vote.This year, Bangladesh has witnessed its worst political\
  \ violence since independence. In another dispute, clashes between opposition protesters\
  \ demanding a halt to war crime trials of their leaders and police have left at\
  \ least 150 people dead.On Tuesday, the country\u2019s highest court halted the\
  \ execution of an Islamist leader at the eleventh hour after a global outcry over\
  \ fair trials.The Supreme Court stopped the hanging of Abdul Quader Molla, a senior\
  \ leader of the Jamaat-i-Islami party, just 90 minutes before he was to become the\
  \ first person executed for war crimes during the country\u2019s bloody independence\
  \ fight.Jamaat and its key ally, BNP, have decried the war crimes trials as a government\
  \ witch-hunt against opposition leaders.\u2014AFP"

  Florence Parly said on Friday.  Two French agents in our service and probably one
  of the spouses of these agents are accused of serious acts likely to be considered
  acts of treason, on suspicions of delivering information to a foreign power,  Parly
  told CNews television. Asked about unconfirmed reports that China was the foreign
  power in question, the minister said she  can t say much .  France has partners
  but we live in a dangerous world, and unfortunately these types of things can happen,  she
  added. The two retired spies, one of whom was reportedly posted in Beijing, were
  arrested and indicted last December. They are being prosecuted for  delivering to
  a foreign power information that undermines the fundamental interests of the nation  and  compromising
  the secrecy of national defence .  One of them has also been charged for direct
  incitement to the crime of treason,  according to French reports quoting sources
  close to the investigation. A third person   believed to be a spouse to one of them   has
  been indicted for  concealment of treasonable crimes  and placed under judicial
  control. According to a statement by the Defense Ministry, the General Directorate
  for External Security (DGSE) intelligence agency alerted French prosecutors after
  uncovering the  extremely serious  behaviour of its former agents.  The fact that
  we sounded the alert is proof of our vigilance,  Parly said. The minister said the
  compromised information handed by the agents while still in service for the DGSE  could
  undermine the security of the state . (AA) Related '

text: '  Monitoring Desk KABUL: An estimated 160,000 to 200,000 children under one
  year of age in Afghanistan   one in three   received zero vaccinations last year,
  the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) said in a statement on Wednesday. These gaps
  in routine immunization coverage not only put the lives of under-vaccinated children
  at risk but also everyone around them. Insecurity in parts of the country reduces
  access for health workers to reach children and for families to get to health clinics,
  while displaced populations and those living in remote areas are also more likely
  to miss out on vaccines.  Immunization is the right of every child, we must accelerate
  our efforts to ensure all children in the country are vaccinated and protected from
  preventable diseases,  said H.E. Minister for Public Health, Dr Ferozuddin Feroz.  Through
  immunization we can protect children from diseases, such as measles, polio and pneumonia   a
  major killer of children under 5 years of age,  Dr, Feroz added. The remarks come
  as Afghanistan marks,  World Immunization Week , which is celebrated annually, 24-30
  April, to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination and ensure that people
  take action to receive all required life-saving vaccines. The theme for 2018 is:  Protected
  Together, #VaccinesWork . Efforts to eradicate polio also continue in Afghanistan
  and most of the country remains polio-free. In 2018, there have been 7 polio cases,
  mostly restricted to high-risk areas in the southern and eastern regions.  We are
  seeing improvements in routine immunization coverage and new vaccines have been
  introduced,  said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative in Afghanistan.  But
  the country is still behind schedule on the targets for disease eradication and
  elimination, including polio, measles, rubella, and maternal and neonatal tetanus.
  We must make more concerted efforts to reach all Global Vaccine Action Plan goals
  by 2020,  Dr. Peeperkorn added. The Global Vaccine Action Plan was endorsed by the
  World Health Assembly in 2012 and is a commitment to ensure that no one misses out
  on vital immunization by 2020.  We must all commit to providing every child with
  the lifesaving vaccines they need,  said Stefano Savi, UNICEF s deputy representative
  in Afghanistan.  This includes reaching the most vulnerable children, who are often
  affected by conflict or living in the most remote areas of the country. Children
  in Afghanistan have the right to get the best start in life, to develop and progress
  like any child,  Savi added. Immunization saves millions of lives globally each
  year and is widely recognized as one of the world s most successful and cost-effective
  health interventions. Key facts and progress: The number of health centres providing
  immunization services increased by 12 per cent to 1,767 facilities around the country.
  In 2017, some 1,250,000 children, under one year old, were vaccinated in against
  measles, polio, whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria, pneumonia, meningitis and tuberculosis.
  In 2017, 900,000 pregnant women and children younger than 5 were provided with medicines
  for antenatal care, newborn care, pneumonia, diarrhoea and meningitis. 10 antigens
  are currently included in Afghanistan s routine immunization programme, available
  free of charge. In recent years, Afghanistan has introduced new vaccines, including
  the Pentavalent vaccine protecting people from five deadly diseases and the Pneumococcal
  vaccine to fight pneumonia. This year, the Ministry of Public Health introduced
  the Rota vaccine, it s hoped that this will significantly reduce mortality due to
  diarrhea in the country, From July to September 2018, a nationwide measles immunization
  campaign will target 14 million children, aged 10 months to five years.     Related '

text: 'Nearly half the world s schools lack clean drinking water, toilets and handwashing
  facilities, putting millions of children at risk of disease, experts warned on Monday.
  Almost 900 million children have to contend with a lack of basic hygiene facilities
  during their education, putting their health at risk and meaning some have to miss
  school.  You can t have a quality learning environment without these basics,  said
  Dr Rick Johnston of the World Health Organization, a lead researcher on the project.  Children
  may not come to school at all if there s no toilets ... Then, when they are at school,
  they are not going to at their very best if they not able to use a decent toilet
  or if they are not properly hydrated.  World leaders have signed up to global pledges
  to provide safe water and hygiene facilities for all and ensure every child gets
  a comprehensive education by 2030 under the UN s sustainable development goals.
  A lack of safe water and sanitation facilities can cause dehydration, illness, and
  even death. But many children are forced to risk their health to take part in classes,
  according to the report produced jointly by the United Nations Children s Fund UNICEF
  and the WHO, the first to look specifically at provision in schools. It found nearly
  a third of primary and secondary schools lacked a safe and reliable drinking water
  supply, affecting nearly 570 million children. Nearly 20 per cent of schools had
  no safe drinking water at all. Just over a third of schools lacked adequate toilet
  facilities, affecting more than 620 million children. Almost one in five primary
  schools and one in eight secondary schools were considered to have no sanitation.
  Nearly half lacked proper handwashing facilities, essential for helping prevent
  the spread of infections and disease. Nearly 900 million children were affected,
  the report found. Sub-Saharan Africa, East and Southeast Asia had some of the worst
  facilities.  It s deeply shocking,  Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of charity
  WaterAid, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The consequences are very broad
  in terms of children s access to education, general health and state of nutrition.  Adolescent
  girls in particular are often forced to miss classes when they are on their periods
  if there are no proper cleaning and sanitation facilities, he said. More than a
  third of girls in South Asia miss school during their periods, often because they
  lack access to toilets or pads, according to a WaterAid and UNICEF study earlier
  this year. The World Bank last year warned countries needed to quadruple spending
  to $150 billion a year to deliver universal safe water and sanitation. However,
  experts say they are optimistic the situation can be quickly improved if leaders
  treat water, sanitation and hygiene as a priority.  With political will, it really
  is possible to deliver good quality services,  said Johnston. '

  Sotoudeh said she was launching her protest over the recent arrest of a prominent
  civil rights activist and the harassment of his, and her own, family by security
  forces. Sotoudeh served about half of a six-year jail sentence imposed in 2010 for
  spreading propaganda and conspiring to harm state security   charges she denied   before
  being freed in 2013. She was arrested again in June and her husband, Reza Khandan,
  told Iranian media she is facing security charges. "Since none of my correspondence

  strike as of [August 25, 2018] in protest against the judicial arrests and pressure
  against my family, relatives and friends," Sotoudeh wrote on Khandan s Facebook

  in our dear country Iran." Sotoudeh, who has represented Iranian opposition activists,
  embarked on an earlier 50-day hunger strike in 2012 against a travel ban on her
  daughter. Her case then caused an international outcry in which the United States
  and the human rights group Amnesty International criticised Iran and she was freed

  #HBLPSL #AbKhelJamayGa #QGvIU DUBAI: Islamabad United skipper Misbahul Haq on Friday
  lauded veteran fast bowler Muhammad Sami`s performance by calling him a  proven
  match winner . Sami delivered one of his best spells in T20 cricket to defend 5
  runs off the last over, helping Islamabad defeat Quetta Gladiators by one run and
  confirming a berth in the Pakistan Super League playoffs. Speaking about the match-changing
  last over, Misbah said: "He''s a proven match winner and if there was someone we
  could turn to for the last over, it was Sami. With all of his experience, it turned
  out to be the right decision." He added: "We were under pressure for 18 overs, but
  that''s cricket. We held our nerves, stuck to a plan, and thanks to Allah it worked
  out." Sami - who is celebrating his 36th birthday today - in a facebook live session
  said that while bowling the final over he ensured that he sticks with the team plan.   Quetta
  needed just five runs off last over with six wickets in hands but Anwar Ali and
  Rilee Rossouw failed to complete the victory for Quetta. Chasing a target of 166
  in 20 overs, Quetta were provided a solid base by Ahmad Shahzad and Kevin Pietersen,
  but despite coming so near to the victory, Gladiators fell short. '

text: 'THE HAGUE: Iran will argue Monday against renewed sanctions imposed by the
  United States, as a bitter legal battle between Tehran and Washington opens before
  the UN s top court. US President Donald Trump reimposed a wave of tough unilateral
  sanctions on Iran three weeks ago, bringing back into effect harsh penalties that
  had been lifted under a landmark 2015 agreement. A second round of measures is to
  come into effect in early November, targeting Iran s valuable oil and energy sector.
  Tehran filed its case before the International Court of Justice in late July, calling
  on the Hague-based tribunal s judges to order the immediate lifting of sanctions,
  which it said would cause "irreparable prejudice." The US had no right to reinstate
  such measures, Tehran added, as it demanded compensation for damages. Iran maintained
  restoring the penalties lifted under the historic 2015 deal, aimed at curbing Tehran
  s nuclear ambitions, violated a decades-old treaty signed between the two nations
  in 1955. The ICJ -- set up in 1946 to rule in disputes between countries -- is expected
  to take a couple of months to decide whether to grant Tehran s request for a provisional
  ruling, while a final decision in the case may actually still take years. Trump
  described the 2015 deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the United
  Nations Security Council, as well as Germany, as a "horrible one-sided deal (that)
  failed to achieve the fundamental objective of blocking all paths to a Iranian nuclear
  bomb." Even though all of the other parties pleaded with him not to abandon the
  pact, Trump pulled out and announced he would reinstate sanctions.  Neither war,
  nor negotiations  Tehran -- which argues that the move violates the little-known
  1955 Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations -- says that the new sanctions are already
  hurting its economy. Iran s currency the rial has lost around half its value since
  April. A raft of international companies -- including France s Total, Peugeot and
  Renault, and Germany s Siemens and Daimler -- have suspended operations in Iran
  in the wake of the move. Both Air France and British Airways announced Thursday
  they were halt flights to Tehran next month, saying they were not commercially viable,
  but the British carrier added the decision was unrelated to the new tranche of sanctions.
  In his executive order, Trump argued that the sanctions would turn up the financial
  pressure on Tehran to come to a "comprehensive and lasting solution" regarding activities
  that the international community regarded as "malign" such as Iran s "ballistic
  missile programme and its support for terrorism." Earlier this month, Iran s supreme
  leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to rule out any immediate prospect of talks,
  saying "there will be neither war, nor negotiations," with the US. Washington s
  lawyers will present their case on Tuesday, with experts believing they are to challenge
  the ICJ s jurisdiction. '

text: 'JAKARTA: China s Su Bingtian was crowned Asia s fastest man on Sunday, justifying
  the hype surrounding him by winning the blue riband 100 metres sprint gold in an
  Asian Games record time.  Su became the first Asian-born sprinter to run the distance
  in under 10 seconds in June when he clocked 9.91 twice in the space of eight days,
  matching the Asian record held by Qatar s Nigerian-born Femi Ogunode. On Sunday,
  he held off his opponents with a late burst of speed to win the event in 9.92 seconds,
  ahead of Nigerian-born Qatari Tosin Ogunode, who clocked 10.00, on a hot and humid
  night in the Indonesian capital.  It wasn t about the time, it was about getting
  the win,  Su, 28, told reporters.  I knew that if I got a good start then I can
  t be beaten.  Japan s Ryota Yamagata was credited with the same time as Ogunode
  and won bronze. Indonesian teenager Lalu Muhammad Zohri ran a personal best of 10.20
  but it was good enough for only seventh spot. The crowd at the Gelora Bung Karno
  Stadium was in for a surprise in the women s 100m final when Nigerian-born Edidiong
  Odiong of Bahrain was adjudged the winner in a photo-finish over India s Dutee Chand,
  who lost her lead in the last few metres. The 21-year-old Odiong clocked 11.30 to
  be crowned Asia s fastest woman. Chand was cleared to race in 2015 following a Court
  of Arbitration for Sport ruling on gender testing guidelines. The Lausanne-based
  court suspended the governing International Association of Athletics Federations  regulations
  regarding hyperandrogenism, a condition which produces high testosterone levels
  allowing Chand to compete again after a year sat out. Pre-race favourite Wei Yongli
  of China, who recently became the first Asian woman to break the 11-second barrier,
  had topped the timings in Saturday s heats and also the semi-finals but had to be
  satisfied with a bronze. Sudan-born Abdalelah Hassan gave Qatar its first gold medal
  at the 18th Asian Games in the men s 400m, finishing ahead of India s Muhammed Anas
  in 44.89 seconds. Ali Khamis won the bronze for Bahrain. Salwa Naser maintained
  Bahrain s hold on the women s 400m, following in the footsteps of Kemi Adekoya,
  who won the event in Incheon, South Korea, four years ago. The Nigerian-born Naser,
  who won silver at the world championships last year, comfortably won in an Asian
  Games record time of 50.09. India s Hima Das, the under-20 world champion, won silver
  while Elina Mikhina claimed bronze for Kazakhstan. Women s shot put world champion
  Gong Lijiao and Gao Yang made it a one-two for China although Gong s distance of
  19.66m was over two metres more than her compatriot. China has now won gold in the
  women s shot put at each of the last 11 Asian Games, dating back to 1978. China
  also took the top two positions in the men s long jump when Wang Jianan and Zhang
  Yaoguang won the gold and silver medals respectively. Bahrain also had their one-two
  moment on the night when Moroccan-born Hassan Chani and Kenyan-born Abraham Cheroben
  won the gold and silver respectively in the men s 10,000m. India s Govindan Lakshmanan
  won the bronze but was later disqualified for stepping off the track during the
  race. Jung Hye-lim won the women s 100m hurdles to give South Korea their first
  Asiad gold in athletics in eight years. Silver medallist Emilia Nova became the
  first Indonesian woman to win a track medal since Supriati Sutono s 5000m gold in
  1998.  This silver medal means a lot. Two weeks ago my hip flexor hurt but the past
  week I managed the pain. Because of the Asian Games, I just ignored the pain,  Nova
  said. '

  \      ISLAMABAD: The government has finalised the process of appointments of heads\
  \ of public sector enterprises and statutory bodies which are running without regular\
  \ chiefs since the PML-N came to power, and has sent the report to Establishment\
  \ Division, according to Khawaja Zaheer Ahmed, special assistant to the prime minister.\
  \ After the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict of abolishing the commission constituted\
  \ for the appointment of heads of PSE, the government gave free hand to these institutions\
  \ for choosing a panel of suitable candidates for heading these institutions. The\
  \ apex court had set the deadline of December 31 for finalising the process and\
  \ submitting a report in this regard.Khawaja Zaheer Ahmed, head of the committee\
  \ constituted by the government for the appointment of heads of public sector enterprises,\
  \ while talking to The News said that the committee has completed the assigned task.\
  \ \u201CThe committee finalised its task today (Wednesday) and sent the report to\
  \ Establishment Division which would further proceed as per the court\u2019s verdict.\
  \ Out of 53 remaining PSEs only four companies i.e. Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Oil\
  \ and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL)\
  \ and Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) have asked for reviewing their panel\
  \ of candidates and sought some time which the committee granted,\u201D said Khawaja\
  \ Zaheer.The committee comprised former secretary law Barrister Zafrullah Khan,\
  \ Muhammad Zubair, secretary Establishment Division, secretary Cabinet Division\
  \ and the secretary of the relevant ministry.\u201CAfter reviewing the commission\u2019\
  s work and sensitivity of the matter, the committee in its initial report to the\
  \ government recommended that all the state-run enterprises which are being run\
  \ without a regular head should be given free hand to choose a suitable panel of\
  \ candidates to head them. We have told them to bring the panel of names to the\
  \ committee and then the committee would decide about the finalists and recommend\
  \ his name to the prime minister,\u201D he said.He said there is a minor change\
  \ in the process of appointment of heads of the state-run enterprises as earlier\
  \ the ministry used to send three names to the prime minister. However now the departments\
  \ concerned and ministries would bring these names to the committee and committee\
  \ would review them after which it would present its recommendations to the prime\
  \ minister.When asked about the reason for delay in the appointment process as the\
  \ government could appoint only five heads of the institutions so far, he said the\
  \ commission delayed the process as it failed to fulfill its task.\u201CThe commission\
  \ was fully authorised and was given a free hand but it failed as it could not hold\
  \ its meetings regularly. Due to the failure of the commission, the government has\
  \ to face criticism,\u201D he remarked.  He said the committee has made it clear\
  \ to all these institutions that they could re-advertise the positions if they want\
  \ to include eligible candidates in the list. However the final decision would be\
  \ taken by the committee after scrutinising the list of candidates.Five of 58 state-run\
  \ enterprises and statutory bodies got their chiefs already, whereas the process\
  \ of 15 organisations is under process, three departments have been dissolved or\
  \ devolved while cases of five institutions are pending in the court, he said. The\
  \ boards of National Investment Trust (NIT), Oil and Gas Development Corporation\
  \ Limited (OGDCL), National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), Utility Stores Corporation (USC),\
  \ Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM), Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Pakistan Railways\

  \ (SNGPL), State Life Insurance (SLI), Trading Corporation, Zarai Taraqiati Bank\
  \ Limited (ZTBL), Privatization Commission (PC), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL),\
  \ Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and all the electricity distribution companies are complete\
  \ now and are fully authorised to recommend a panel of names for heading these institutions."

text: "A capital storm\n                            A near-perfect storm is now swirling\
  \ around capital punishment in Pakistan where a seven-year old moratorium has recently\
  \ been lifted in the wake of the Peshawar tragedy. The EU is against the decision,\
  \ being an ardent supporter of abolishing capital punishment globally. In accordance\
  \ with a 2008 report, 137 countries had abolished death penalty in law or in practice\
  \ while the US, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan retained it and accounted\
  \ for 88 percent of the world\u2019s executions.In an indirect manner, some political\
  \ parties in the country are also whipping up opposition through objections to the\
  \ government\u2019s current efforts to institute military courts through an amendment\
  \ to the constitution for speedy justice. It is not difficult to see that such resistance\
  \ is not so much out of deference to human rights or any consideration for the constitution\
  \ of Pakistan, but out of fear that a combination of speedy trials and lifting of\
  \ moratorium would adversely affect their politics which so far have had a strong\
  \ streak of violence.The EU position is understandable; it saw Pakistan as a country\
  \ on the \u2018cusp\u2019 of abolishing the death penalty when former president\
  \ Asif Ali Zardari imposed a ban on executions in 2008. Recent developments have\
  \ reversed that status. The EU had invested much effort with the Zardari regime\
  \ through political arm twisting through the European Instrument for Democracy and\
  \ Human Right (EIDHR), matched by its mechanism of funding through the European\
  \ Commission. But Zardari was confused; on the one hand the government was imposing\
  \ a moratorium on capital punishment and at the same time promulgating the Prevention\
  \ of Electronic Crimes Ordinance which included \u2018cyber terrorism\u2019 in the\
  \ list of offences warranting the death penalty.In countries where the death penalty\
  \ situation is still in flux, EU has been striving for adherence to minimum international\
  \ standards \u2013 imposing capital punishment only for the most serious intentional\
  \ and violent crimes, not imposing it on anyone less than eighteen years of age,\
  \ pregnant women, new mothers, or persons with mental disorder. The standard requires\
  \ a fair trial where the defendant benefits from legal assistance and has recourse\
  \ to an appeal process. Also every endeavour is made that there is minimum possible\
  \ suffering while carrying out the punishment. But it has taken centuries for Europe\u2019\
  s civilisation to arrive at a stage where as a society it considers the death sentence\
  \ to be cruel, inhuman and irreversible and would like to abolish it for the sake\
  \ of human dignity and progressive development of human rights. Also historically\
  \ Europe has used a whole range of very painful methods to inflict death on convicted\
  \ prisoners which are too gory to be narrated here.It is audacious to think how\
  \ a punishment that snuffs out life out of an otherwise perfectly healthy body,\
  \ can be termed as causing less suffering than another, but certainly there is a\
  \ difference between hangings as per Pakistan\u2019s jail manuals which bring life\
  \ to a sudden end as opposed to some of the seemingly sophisticated methods in the\
  \ west. Earlier this year, Dennis McGuire, who was administered a lethal injection\
  \ in an Ohio jail writhed in acute and miserable pain for nearly fifteen minutes\
  \ before breathing his last.It is also interesting to note that in the past, most\
  \ of the offences for which the death sentence was awarded in Europe, were minor\
  \ compared to today\u2019s standards. It is only through a process of evolution\
  \ that the public mind in Europe accepts interning a mass killer like the Norwegian\
  \ Anders Breivik on an island for 21 years as punishment for killing 77 innocent\
  \ lives in 2011 \u2013 the highest in Norway for such offences \u2013 just over\
  \ three months for every person killed. Indeed life couldn\u2019t come have cheaper\
  \ in a society where it is otherwise so valued. Pakistan is relatively a nascent\
  \ state on the timeline of global civilisation. It inherited English jurisprudence\
  \ tailored to serve the purposes of erstwhile colonial masters when it came into\
  \ existence. Under the best of circumstances, we are never a very stable society\
  \ and governments of every hue have been found struggling to keep the crime rate\
  \ to a manageable level. Historically, the death sentence has never reduced the\
  \ crime rate to zero but it has helped lower it. Towards that end, capital punishment\
  \ in Pakistan had an element of fear for would-be offenders and acts as deterrence.\
  \ Over time, as societal turbulence increased, the number of offences punishable\
  \ by death has also risen but in spite of the heinous nature of the crime in some\
  \ cases, Pakistan has never violated the minimum international standards. Successive\
  \ governments, except for a brief period during General Ziaul Haq\u2019s rule, have\
  \ also kept capital punishments out of public view despite public pressure as is\
  \ being witnessed these days.The social fabric of today\u2019s Pakistan has been\
  \ ripped apart by a process started decades ago by former President Ronald Reagan\
  \ when he chose to fight the \u2018evil empire\u2019 in Afghanistan by dusting off\
  \ the concept of armed Islamic jihad and employing it as a weapon in the game between\
  \ superpowers. Terrorism refuses to die as was witnessed in Peshawar recently. That\
  \ element of fear which was meant for would-be offenders through the death penalty\
  \ has struck deep into the hearts of our mothers, sisters and children and has made\
  \ normal life impossible. This fear has to be taken out of our people and put back\
  \ into the hearts of those who perpetuate such heinous crimes. The citizens of Pakistan\
  \ deserve some peace of mind and if it is through capital punishments, let it be\
  \ so. A guiding principle for capital punishment enunciated by Prophet Muhammad\
  \ (pbuh) mentions only three offences \u2013 murder, illegal sexual intercourse\
  \ committed by a married person and apostasy. Pakistan\u2019s penal code, however,\
  \ prescribes death sentence for 27 different crimes which can perhaps be reviewed\
  \ downward in deference to global sentiments on the issue especially where crime\
  \ has been checked effectively. But any outright move to abolish capital punishment\
  \ will not only aggravate the law and order situation but also be a breach of the\
  \ country\u2019s constitution which declares that no law shall be enacted against\
  \ Islamic injunctions as stipulated in the Quran and Sunnah.The former chief justice\
  \ was recently asked why the conviction rate in the anti-terrorist courts was so\
  \ low to which he responded by admitting that when evidence falls short, the courts\
  \ have no option but to let the accused go free. This is a perfectly legal approach\
  \ but the question honourable judges should be asking themselves is whether doing\
  \ so always serves the ends of justice. Would justice be better served if in an\
  \ odd case of huge public interest, and where the judge is convinced beyond any\
  \ shadow of doubt that evidence has been intentionally left patchy during investigation\
  \ under pressure from the powerful, the judgements are in response to public expectations\
  \ and not a computerised outcome of the arguments in the courts?That said, the real\
  \ issue we should be looking at is that, as far as possible, no innocent should\
  \ be deprived of his life due to miscarriage of justice. Our existing legal system\
  \ is highly flawed where self-confessed criminals of major crimes roam about freely\
  \ and the innocent get punished. The EU would therefore do well to channel its EIDHR\
  \ support, complemented by European Commission funding, towards bringing about much-needed\
  \ jurisprudence infrastructure reforms in Pakistan rather than focusing on the moratorium\
  \ on the death penalty.The writer is a retired vice admiral. Email: [email\_protected]"

  \     LAHORETHE dream of completing a historical World Bank funded land record computerisation\
  \ project could not come true in the year 2014 despite tall claims made by Punjab\
  \ Chief Minister Mian Shahbaz Sharif in the said context. The first deadline to\
  \ complete the historical project was set for June 2014 and later December 2014\
  \ by the CM but computerisation of the land record could only be completed in 20\
  \ districts including Kasur, Sheikhupura, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Nankana Sahib,\
  \ Jhang, Jhelum, Lodhran, and Lahore out of total 36 districts of the province.\
  \ Similarly, around 12,500 muzaz out of total 23,000 were computerised in the year\
  \ 2014 in comparison with 2,500 muzaz which were completed in the year 2013. Besides\
  \ this, Arazi Record Centres have also been established in 143 tehsils of the province\
  \ during 2014 to provide further benefit to the masses. Now the project is expected\
  \ to be completed by June 2015. In those districts where the new system has started\
  \ working, any citizen can get the record of his piece of land in just 30 minutes\
  \ while transfer record can be made available within 50 minutes only. The computerisation\
  \ of land record has also made the process of getting \u2018Fard\u2019 more friendly\
  \ and the legal fee of Fard has also been reduced to Rs 150. It is expected that\
  \ when this modern system became fully functional in all the districts of the province,\
  \ the culture of corruption, bribery and forgery in the matters related to land\
  \ would be eliminated and the people would get rid of exploitative system of Patwaris\
  \ and Tehsildars. Due to computerisation of land record, the threat of theft and\
  \ loss of documents in fire or flood will also be minimised. It is pertinent to\
  \ mention here that the project \u2018Land Record Computerisation\u2019 was initiated\
  \ by Ch Pervaiz Elahi as a pilot project. The aim of the project was to get rid\
  \ the province of corrupt practices and irregularities of Patwaris and other revenue\
  \ officers. The project moved ahead very slowly every year. Designed by the Project\
  \ Management Unit, the project was recommended to the World Bank Board for funding\
  \ in 2006 and subsequently the Project Financing Agreement was signed on February\
  \ 28, 2007. During the previous era of incumbent PML-N\u2019s provincial government,\
  \ nothing tangible work could be done on the project and the project was delayed\
  \ further mainly because of delay in the software development and selection process\
  \ which was expected to be completed by the end of 2008. Similarly, implementation\
  \ of the project in four districts of the province, to be initiated in 2009, got\
  \ delayed. After the software development, the work on computerising the land record\
  \ got underway in the Punjab to facilitate more than 20 million land owners of the\
  \ province. To expand the Land Record Management Information Systems project in\
  \ the entire Punjab by CM Shahbaz Sharif was the other reason for the delay in the\
  \ completion of the project as initially the project was to be implemented in only\
  \ half of the districts of the province. Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad\
  \ Shahbaz Sharif presided over a high level meeting on Wednesday which reviewed\
  \ in detail the progress of the Land Record Management Information System. According\
  \ to a handout issued on Wednesday, addressing the meeting, the chief minister said\
  \ that the land record computerisation service centres had been made operational\
  \ in all the 143 tehsils of the province. He said through the computerisation of\
  \ land record issuance of proprietary deed had been ensured within 30 minutes which\
  \ would provide substantial relief to citizens as well as rid them of obsolete Patwar\
  \ Culture. He said the computerisation of land record had been completed in 20 districts\
  \ and online system at 92 service centres had been linked with a consolidated system.\
  \ He further said the process of Google mapping with regard to land had been completed\
  \ in three districts. The CM directed that the programme of Google mapping of the\
  \ land be extended to the whole province and an effective awareness campaign be\
  \ initiated regarding the importance of the project. He appreciated institutions\
  \ and authorities concerned over a speedy progress on the project and said it was\
  \ a public welfare project which would directly benefit the masses. The chief minister\
  \ issued instructions for setting up a steering committee to be headed by Member\
  \ Punjab Assembly Rana Sana Ullah and directed that the committee should submit\
  \ recommendations within seven days after reviewing matters pertaining to the launching\
  \ of the project of computerisation of urban land record, restriction on consolidation,\
  \ setting up of an authority with regard to permanent monitoring of the Land Record\
  \ Management Information System and other matters. The chairman planning and development\
  \ gave a detailed briefing on the pace of the project. Provincial Minister for Law\
  \ Mujtaba Shuja-ur-Rehman, Assembly Members Najaf Abbas Sial, Rana Sana Ullah, Dr.\
  \ Ayesha Ghous Pasha, Mian Tariq Mehmood, Qamar-ul-Islam, chief secretary, senior\
  \ member, board of revenue, chairman planning and development and officers concerned\
  \ were also present."
