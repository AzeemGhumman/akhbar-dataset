  \ allocations and state of the art financial institutional disaster management structure\
  \ at all administrative levels.The bill aimed at amending the National Disaster\
  \ Management Act, 2010 was moved by Senator Mian Muhammad Ateeq Shaikh.Amendment\
  \ of section 4, Act XXIV of 2010 has been made replacing the words \u201Cas and\

  \ Disaster Management Act, 2010 needs to be improved to make it more comprehensive\
  \ and gender responsive with appropriate financial allocations and state of the\
  \ art international disaster management structure at all administrative levels.NDMA\
  \ has to undergone a paradigm shift focusing on human rights based approach while\
  \ central to it are women rights.In future there is a need to extend shelter, land\
  \ and livelihood support solely to women adding that gender mainstreaming should\
  \ become the priority area of work for the NDMA.\u201CWe need to review our commitment\
  \ to step up our efforts for the rehabilitation of flood affectees with special\
  \ reference to women and children.The government should redistribute land to women,\
  \ especially landless rural women to fulfill their constitutional rights to have\
  \ access, control and ownership of land.The government should ensure the restoration\
  \ of livelihood through provision of agricultural inputs by introducing a comprehensive\
  \ agriculture rehabilitation package.\u201D Similarly, the meetings of National\
  \ Disaster Management Commission should be held at least once in a year in order\
  \ to perform its important role at national, provincial and district policy level\
  \ and forward its valuable recommendations in this regard.The meetings are vital\
  \ in order to mainstream DRR (disaster risk reduction) at the local level and attempt\
  \ to harmonize local government laws with the Disaster Management Act.Pakistan is\
  \ a disaster prone country \u201CUnspeakable\u201D miseries of the flood affectees\
  \ were observed during the 2010 floods that were of highest magnitude and wrecked\
  \ havoc in terms of men and material losses in parts of Sindh.Around 58 percent\
  \ people in Pakistan were food insecure adding that the floods 2011 further aggravated\
  \ the situation to an alarming level.Unfortunately red tapeism was one of the biggest\
  \ hurdles to move things forward during the devastated floods. Even the available\
  \ funds were not being utilized properly because of lack of accountability. There\
  \ is an acute malnutrition among Pakistani children, which needs to be addressed\
  \ without further delay.A new paragragh has been added in section 9, Act XXIV of\
  \ 2010. (K) to set up efforts for the rehabilitation of disaster affectees\u2019\
  \ with special reference to women and children, especially the provision of shelter\
  \ and livelihood support to be extended to landless rural women, and (1) to ensure\

  \ Bill, 2018\u201D, and \u201CThe Marriage Functions (Prohibition of Ostentatious\
  \ Displays and Wasteful Expenses) Bill, 2018.\u201D The chair referred the bills\
