text: "Kanupp defends its ambitions, rules out doomsday scenario\n\n             \
  \           KARACHI: As independent scientists, environmentalists and civil society\
  \ organizations continue their campaign to oppose Pakistan\u2019s decision to build\
  \ two more nuclear reactors in Karachi, scientists, engineers and management at\
  \ Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) insist that the country\u2019s move is the\
  \ most viable option to generate clean energy to overcome its lingering power crisis.Pakistan\
  \ is building two more nuclear reactors of 1100 megawatt each at Karachi coast in\
  \ collaboration with China to overcome crippling energy crisis. The twin plants\
  \ are scheduled to generate 2200 megawatt electricity within next five-six years.During\
  \ a visit to country\u2019s first nuclear facility, the KANUPP and site of K2 and\
  \ K3, reporters were briefed on the safety measures as well as its prospects as\
  \ viable and effective contributor to power generation.Afzar Minhaj, general manager\
  \ of KANNUP, said Pakistan has saved millions of dollars in oil export bills due\
  \ to power generations at country\u2019s nuclear reactors.A detailed presentation\
  \ during the briefing argued: \u201CThe nuclear energy is only affordable mature\
  \ option for clean energy. Karachi that too is faced with acute power shortage has\
  \ to contribute in energy generation rather to remain dependent. K-2 and K-3 projects\
  \ will provide clean energy, overcoming the power shortage and leaving minimum impact\
  \ on environment\u201D.To a question as to why the country can\u2019t rely on solar,\
  \ wind and hydro options for power generation, the authorities believed that Karachi\
  \ is not the best place to take advantage of these alternatives.\u201CYou need 500\
  \ acres land to establish a solar energy plant of 100 megawatt while K-2 and K-3\
  \ that will generate 2200 megawatt energy are being built on 585 acres. This space\
  \ is enough to set up more such plants,\u201D said Azfar Minhaj.\u201DHe said the\
  \ hydro power generation, though environment friendly, has certain issues as well\
  \ and so is the case with solar power.Discussing public perception on nuclear disasters,\
  \ he said concerns about radiation related emergencies in power plants originally\
  \ emanate from World War II nuclear attacks on Japan.Citing different reports from\
  \ international organizations on nuclear accidents, he said more deaths were caused\
  \ by evacuation than radioactivity in Japan\u2019s Fukushima disaster that was caused\
  \ by a tsunami in 2011. \u201CNot a single death was caused due to radioactivity\
  \ in Three Miles Island fiasco despite core meltdown while 28 deaths were caused\
  \ by Chernobyl accident due to radioactivity.\u201D\u201CWe have built our plants\
  \ 12 meter above sea level after conducting a seismic survey based on past Tsunami\
  \ that hit Karachi cost in 1945. The solid structure and strict safety measures\
  \ at KNUPP completely rule out the doomsday scenario where power plants are destroyed\
  \ but Karachi survives.\u201DA senior official said mock evacuations and other such\
  \ exercises were also undertaken in adjacent areas as part of a contingency plan\
  \ to cope up with emergencies. Apart from that, he said 10 detectors have also been\
  \ installed in 10 different areas of the city that gauge the radioactivity. Some\
  \ areas including Sadder, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Orangi Town, Federal B Area, North Karachi,\
  \ Drig Colony, KANUPP Colony, Abdul Rehman Goth and Faqeer Muhammad Goth were also\
  \ under KANNUP surveillance.The KANNUP has also setup a Desalination Demonstration\
  \ Plant in its premises that has been catering its needs for drinking and other\
  \ purposes since 2010. A senior official said the plant at KANNUP is producing 400,000\
  \ gallons water per day that not only meets its own needs, but \u201Cwe are also\
  \ supplying it to nearby villages through tankers\u201D.The KANNUP is also making\
  \ efforts to address health issues of the people living in nearby villages through\
  \ sending mobile nursing units. \u201CWe have frequently arranged gatherings with\
  \ elders of nearby Goths to resolve their issues that they share with us,\u201D\
  \ he said.All in all, with more and more countries embarking on plans to lay their\
  \ hands on civil nuclear technology, it seems Islamabad too is not ready to miss\
  \ out on its socioeconomic development. It appears determined to go ahead with its\
  \ civil nuclear program to overcome power crisis that has crippled the country\u2019\
  s economy."
