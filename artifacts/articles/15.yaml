text: "Sarfraz Merchant refuses to appear before FIA on March 15\nLONDON: Sarfraz\
  \ Merchant, one of the central characters in the MQM-related money-laundering investigation,\
  \ has told the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) investigators that he will be\
  \ unable to appear before it on March 15 to record his statement until the FIA does\
  \ not set its record straight and puts the whole context of the investigation right.\n\
  Merchant set the record straight by telling the FIA that he did not originally accuse\
  \ the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) or its leader Altaf Hussain of receiving money\
  \ from the RAW, India\u2019s main spy agency, but the Scotland Yard, showing proofs.\n\
  Sarfraz Merchant said he has undeniable proofs with him showing that the MQM took\
  \ money from the Indian sources and he indicated that he will cooperate with the\
  \ FIA once amends have been made to the summon, record set straight and inappropriate\
  \ language and threat of punishment withdrawn.\nSarfraz Merchant elaborated that\
  \ it was the Scotland Yard that originally said that the MQM took money from the\
  \ Indian government sources. He said it\u2019s a matter of record that the MQM leaders\
  \ including M Anwar and Tariq Mir accepted before the Scotland Yard investigators\
  \ that they received money from India for several years \u2013 in tune of millions\
  \ of Pounds.\nMerchant said that he came to know about the evidence of the MQM involvement\
  \ with the RAW during his recorded interview with the police in London when he saw\
  \ the shocking evidence when the police investigators revealed it to him. Merchant\
  \ said that he is aware -\_ and has proofs \u2013 that the MQM took money from RAW\
  \ but he was not alone in saying that but the Scotland Yard has said it in writing\
  \ too.\nMerchant said that his only issue is with the FIA letter \u201Cthe way it\
  \ has been presented and written\u201D. He said MQM\u2019s involvement with the\
  \ RAW is a serious matter and must be dealt at the highest level.\nThis correspondent\
  \ has obtained a copy of the hard-hitting letter written by Mr Sarfraz Merchant\
  \ in response to the hurriedly written summon issued by the Federal Investigation\
  \ Agency (FIA) to Sarfraz Merchant, urging him to appear before the committee mandated\
  \ to investigate the alleged links of the MQM with the RAW.\nThe FIA was forced\
  \ into action after Sarfraz Merchant said in a world exclusive with Geo News\u2019\
  \ flagship current affairs show \u2018Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath\u2019 that\
  \ he had been asked by the Scotland Yard investigators during recorded interviews\
  \ if he was aware that the MQM was in the pay of the Indian government sources.\n\
  Sarfraz Merchant said that he had not \u201Clevelled any allegation on any political\
  \ party or its leadership\u201D. He told the FIA that his interview on Geo News\
  \ was \u201Cin connection with a leaked document pertaining to a criminal inquiry\
  \ pending in the United Kingdom\u201D \u2013 i.e., money-laundering investigation\
  \ under the Proceeds of Crimes Act involving Altaf Hussain, M Anwar, Tariq Mir,\
  \ Sarfraz Merchant and two others.\n\u201CI had given my views on the contents of\
  \ that document and some observations of the concerned law enforcement agency of\
  \ UK Scotland Yard, which were brought to my notice being a party to the case during\
  \ my under caution interview on 15th of April,2015. It is therefore incorrect to\
  \ suggest that I have alleged something on a political party,\u201D stressed Sarfraz\
  \ Merchant, while explaining that it was not him but the Scotland Yard which believed\
  \ that the MQM received money from the Indian govt in violation of the UK as well\
  \ as Pakistani electoral laws.\nSarfraz Merchant told the FIA bosses that allegations\
  \ about MQM\u2019s links with RAW emerged first in June last year and he wondered\
  \ what took Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s government so long to come into action\
  \ when the nature of the allegations is of shocking and scandalous nature concerning\
  \ directly to the security of Pakistan. Merchant said that the \u201Csubject matter\
  \ of the criminal investigation in the UK is known to all and has been frequently\
  \ discussed in the media and there is no confusion that the issue is directly related\
  \ to the security of Pakistan\u201D.\nIssuing a hard-hitting critique of the very\
  \ poor handing of the case by the government of Pakistan, Merchant said in the letter:\
  \ \u201CI am surprised to learn that you have initiated action at such a belated\
  \ stage. It would have been proper to contact UK authorities more than a year ago\
  \ for mutual assistance and simultaneous initiation of proceedings in Pakistan;\
  \ unfortunately this was not done.\u201D\nSarfraz Merchant expressed his \u201C\
  disappointment on the language and text of your letter which appears to be an attempt\
  \ to intimidate and pressurize me by indicating criminal action against me and also\
  \ placing the entire onus of the case on my shoulders\u201D. Chaudhary Nisar Ali\
  \ Khan had requested Sarfraz Merchant to assist the FIA in its inquiry but the FIA\
  \ issued a threatening summon to Sarfraz Merchant.\nSarfraz Merchant took exception\
  \ to the fact that the FIA summon was signed off by the Commercial Banking Circle.\_\
  \ Merchant said he believed that \u201Cmatters of national security are required\
  \ to be handled more professionally and not as a typical case of Commercial Banking\
  \ Circle\u201D.\nSarfraz Merchant explained that he was a \u201Cresponsible and\
  \ patriotic citizen\u201D of Pakistan and he felt \u201Cobliged to render complete\
  \ assistance in a matter involving security and integrity of the country in accordance\
  \ with law, however the manner in which the case is being handled especially the\
  \ manner in which summon has been issued reflects that importance and gravity of\
  \ the issue has not been understood by your agency\u201D.\nSarfraz Merchant concluded:\
  \ \u201CUnder such circumstances I will not be able to appear on the 15th of March,\
  \ 2016 for giving my statement until the format/contents of your un-dated letter\
  \ delivered to me by DHL and through Pakistan High Commission, London through Post\
  \ received on 11/03/2016 and 12/03/2016 are corrected referred in Paragraph No 3\
  \ of this letter\u201D."
