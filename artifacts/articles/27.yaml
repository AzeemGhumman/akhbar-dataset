text: "Bill tabled in US Senate to block $300 million aid to Pakistan  \_\nWASHINGTON:\
  \ Following the US drone strike that killed Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mansour\
  \ in Balochistan, the top Senate members on Tuesday introduced a new bill to block\
  \ $300 million aid to Pakistan.\nThe resolution requires the secretary of defense\
  \ to certify that Islamabad is taking demonstrative actions against the Haqqani\
  \ Network.\nThe lower house also passed such a bill last week for the National Defence\
  \ Authorization Act (NDAA) 2017. The next fiscal year NDAA is scheduled to come\
  \ up before the Senate for voting as well, where several Senators are expected to\
  \ bring similar amendments.\nThe house amendment wants secretary of defense to certify\
  \ to Congress that Pakistan is not using its military or any funds or equipment\
  \ provided by the US to persecute minority groups seeking political or religious\
  \ freedom.\nEarlier, the White House expressed objection to the bill saying, \"\
  the administration objects to section 1212 of HR 4919, which would make $450 million\
  \ of CSF to Pakistan ineligible for the Secretary of Defense's waiver authority\
  \ unless the Secretary provides a certification to the Congressional defense committees.\"\
  \_\nThe Senate version of the NDAA 2016, that covers 300 million dollar out of Coalition\
  \ Support Fund, already requires a certification that Pakistan was taking action\
  \ against the Haqqani Network.\nThe renewed bill binds the Secretary of Defence\
  \ to appear before the Congress and convince the lawmakers that Pakistan military\
  \ has been taking demonstrated action against the Haqqani Network for them to release\
  \ funds. The NDAA 2016 ends on September 30 this year.\nThe Pentagon spokesperson\
  \ has reportedly commented that the defence secretary has not taken the decision\
  \ regarding the certification yet."
