text: "Trump, Sanders ride US anti-establishment tide to New Hampshire win\nMANCHESTER,\
  \ N.H:\_Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders coasted to victory on\
  \ a wave of voter anger in the New Hampshire presidential nominating contest, thrashing\
  \ traditional U.S. politicians in a display of anti-establishment power.\nSweeping\
  \ wins by Trump, a New York billionaire, and Sanders, a democratic socialist, on\
  \ Tuesday testified to the sizable share of American voters upset at U.S. economic\
  \ conditions and willing to send a shockwave to Washington in the Nov. 8 presidential\
  \ election.\nNew Hampshire's verdict sets up a tough fight for Republicans in South\
  \ Carolina on Feb. 20 and for Democrats there on Feb. 27. Some of the most monumental\
  \ campaign battles in elections past have been fought in the state that holds the\
  \ first primary election of the American South.\nFor Trump, New Hampshire showed\
  \ he has staying power and can take a punch after losing on Feb. 1 to Texas Senator\
  \ Ted Cruz in the first contest, the Iowa caucuses. His win showed pundits were\
  \ wrong to think he would ultimately self-destruct based on his penchant for insults\
  \ and imprecise plans for the presidency.\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton, the former\
  \ U.S. secretary of state and former U.S. senator, now looks wounded, trailing Sanders\
  \ by 60 to 39 percent based on 86 percent of the returns.The wife of former President\
  \ Bill Clinton, Clinton barely won Iowa and now has been trounced in New Hampshire,\
  \ where young voters liked Sanders' populist proposals to break up big banks and\
  \ have the government pay for free college tuition.\n\u201CPeople have every right\
  \ to be angry but they\u2019re also hungry, they\u2019re hungry for solutions,\u201D\
  \ Clinton, 68, said after congratulating the 74-year-old Sanders. \"I will work\
  \ harder than anyone to actually make the changes that make your lives better.\"\
  \nClinton was headed to New York, home to her campaign headquarters, to regroup\
  \ with top aides and prepare for Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate. Her campaign\
  \ has denied reports it is considering a shakeup but acknowledged it would be natural\
  \ to add members to their team as the campaign progresses.\nSanders said his victory\
  \ showed \"we have sent the message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington,\
  \ from Maine to California, and that is that the government of our great country\
  \ belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\"\
  \nSome 73 percent of voters say they think the United States is on the wrong track,\
  \ and these disaffected people make up a majority of the support bases for Trump\
  \ and Sanders, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nThey are worried about the economy\
  \ and distrust establishment politicians they perceive as being part of the problem.\n\
  SHADOW-BOXING TRUMP\nTrump, 69, who has campaigned to deport illegal immigrants\
  \ and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States, was in first place\
  \ with 35 percent of the vote on the Republican side based on 88 percent of returns.\n\
  At his victory rally, Trump dispensed with niceties. He congratulated other candidates\
  \ in the race but promised to soon return to his pugnacious approach.\n\"Tomorrow:\
  \ boom, boom,\" he said, shadow boxing while his supporters cheered.\nThe New Hampshire\
  \ Republican race did little to clear up confusion about who would emerge as the\
  \ establishment contender to Trump on the Republican side.\nOhio's Republican governor,\
  \ John Kasich, won a spirited fight for second place in New Hampshire, with Cruz,\
  \ former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida fighting\
  \ for third place. All four were headed to South Carolina.\nBush, the son and brother\
  \ of former presidents, lived to fight another day, making something of a comeback\
  \ after a strong debate performance and solid weekend of campaigning.\n\u201CWhile\
  \ the reality TV star is doing well, it looks like you all have reset the race,\"\
  \ Bush told supporters. \"This campaign is not dead. We're going on to South Carolina.\"\
  \nRubio failed to dispatch Bush, seeing a drop in his support after a debate on\
  \ Saturday in which he drew criticism for repeating rehearsed lines from his stump\
  \ speech.\n\"I did not do well on Saturday night - listen to this: that will never\
  \ happen again,\" Rubio told supporters.\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who\
  \ called out Rubio for his robotic debate, fell behind the others in the voting\
  \ and canceled plans to go to South Carolina, a sign he could drop out soon.\nDISENCHANTED\
  \ VOTERS\nIndependent voters wield special clout in New Hampshire, second in the\
  \ series of state-by-state contests that lead to the parties' formal presidential\
  \ nominating conventions in July, because they can vote in either party's primary.\n\
  At a polling station in Manchester, Joan and Roland Martineau said they voted for\
  \ the two candidates they believed they could trust to shake things up.\nJoan, 68,\
  \ went for Sanders. \u201CI like this views, I like the way he speaks, I think I\
  \ can trust him,\u201D she said.\nRoland, 73, a registered Republican, went for\
  \ Trump, a man he said was \"more honest\" than other candidates. But he said he\
  \ would back Sanders over Trump in the general election in November.\nClinton had\
  \ for months been the front-runner nationally. But a Reuters/Ipsos poll done Feb\
  \ 2-5 showed Clinton and Sanders now in a dead heat.\nClinton campaign manager Robby\
  \ Mook said in a memo that the Democratic nomination would \"very likely\" be decided\
  \ in March, with the support of black and Hispanic voters key to victory. The next\
  \ primary races are in Nevada and South Carolina later this month.\n\"It will be\
  \ very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without\
  \ strong levels of support among African-American and Hispanic voters,\" Mook wrote."
