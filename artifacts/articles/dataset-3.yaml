text: "Implementation of 5pc quota for minorities in PA secretariat jobs sought\n\
  KARACHI: An application has been filed with Sindh Assembly Speaker Agha Siraj Khan\
  \ Durrani requesting him to ensure that five per cent of vacant positions in the\
  \ assembly secretariat are filled by applicants from religious minorities.Sindh\
  \ Assembly MPA on a reserved seat for minorities, Surender Valasai, who belongs\
  \ to the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, has filed the application.  The Sindh government\
  \ had reserved a five per cent job quota for minorities in its different departments,\
  \ subsidiary agencies and bodies some eight years ago.On February 3, 2015, the then\
  \ house of the Sindh Assembly had also unanimously passed a resolution on this subject.\
  \ The resolution was moved by an Opposition MPA of the Pakistan Muslim League-Functional,\
  \ Nand Kumar Goklani. His resolution stated: \u201CThis House resolves that the\
  \ Provincial Government ensure implementation of 5% quota reserved for minorities\
  \ in employment in government jobs in the province.\u201DOn February 6, 2015 the\
  \ Sindh Assembly secretary sent a circular containing the contents of the resolution\
  \ to the relevant senior officials of the Sindh government for the due implementation\
  \ of the resolution.The circular was sent to the then Sindh chief secretary, the\
  \ Sindh government\u2019s secretary for Services, General Administration, and Coordination\
  \ Department, and the Sindh government Secretary for Minorities\u2019 Affairs Department.Talking\
  \ to The News, Goklani, who has once again become an MPA on a seat reserved for\
  \ minorities, said more than three years had passed but he was yet to get any evidence\
  \ that showed that the Sindh government had implemented his resolution.He said the\
  \ previous PPP government had itself issued orders to ensure five per cent quota\
  \ for minorities in government jobs, but it has failed to implement it until now.\u201C\
  Once it is implemented by PPP\u2019s own government in Sindh, then we could expect\
  \ from the federal government to ensure its implementation,\u201D the PML-F MPA\
  \ said.According to Goklani, he had raised the issue several times in the last Sindh\
  \ Assembly by putting questions during the question hour session and by submitting\
  \ call to attention notices, asking for information on government departments where\
  \ the quota had been implemented."

  \   Pakistan has obtained a breathing space in the wake of steep decline in prices\
  \ of petroleum products in the international market, which will ease down fiscal\
  \ woes of the country over the short-term.The windfall gains obtained through reduced\
  \ oil prices will not last long in 2015, if structural bottlenecks of the economy\
  \ such as energy outages, security concerns and revenue mobilisation are not resolved.The\
  \ real concern for the government will be continuous trend of low GDP growth again\
  \ this year, as despite tall claims the real GDP growth will not be able to cross\
  \ four percent of GDP against the envisaged target of 5.1 percent for 2014/15.Last\
  \ year growth of 4.1 percent will be revised downward in accordance with the annual\
  \ revision, but this low base will not help jack up growth figure for the ongoing\
  \ fiscal year up to the desired level of the economic managers mainly because of\
  \ bad performance of agriculture and manufacturing sectors.It clearly indicates\
  \ there will be job opportunities for new entrants in the labour market and prevalence\
  \ of poverty will continue to rise during the calendar year 2015.Another challenge\
  \ for the government during 2015 will be keeping the International Monetary Fund\
  \ (IMF) programme on track after completion of the sixth review, which was scheduled\
  \ to be completed by the end of February or early March, 2015.The IMF had largely\
  \ recovered its previous loans, which it provided to Islamabad under the PPP dispensation.\
  \ Now the net inflows are going to start and the phase of tough conditions will\
  \ also be gauged by the IMF from the second quarter (April-June) period of the ongoing\
  \ fiscal year 2014/15.But experts said the breathing space obtained by Islamabad\
  \ in the aftermath of reduction in POL prices would go a long way in keeping the\
  \ IMF programme on track over the short-term and this incumbent regime would be\
  \ able to manage completion of the next review (sixth review) of the IMF programme\
  \ without facing much difficulty.The fiscal side of the economy is real problematic\
  \ area in the wake of expected shortfall in the revenue collection of the Federal\
  \ Board of Revenue (FBR). The government had envisaged annual tax collection target\
  \ of Rs2,810 billion and the IMF had already projected downward revision from Rs2,810\
  \ billion to Rs2,756 billion. However, economists say the FBR\u2019s tax collection\
  \ will stand at the maximum of around Rs2,550 to Rs2,600 billion.In order to bridge\
  \ the gap, the government has jacked up the general sales tax (GST) rate from 17\
  \ percent to 22 percent on POL products in order to offset the revenue losses because\
  \ of reduction in oil prices in the international market.The subsidy to the power\
  \ sector will also decline because of falling prices of the furnace oil so it will\
  \ help curtail the budget deficit close to the level agreed with the IMF for the\
  \ current fiscal year.The interest rates are on the declining trend in the wake\
  \ of decreasing inflation because of base effect in the same period of the last\
  \ fiscal year, but it will rebound in the second half (January-June) period of the\
  \ current fiscal year because of the possible upsurge in the energy prices. But\
  \ inflation on an average will remain around seven percent so the discount rate\
  \ will also come down.\u201CIn the wake of possible reduction in the interest rates,\
  \ Pakistan\u2019s debt servicing will be scaled down by Rs120 to Rs130 billion during\
  \ the current fiscal year on account of both external, as well as domestic loans,\u201D\
  \ official sources said.However, the government would be able to get savings in\
  \ debt servicing and subsidy amounts, which will compensate the FBR\u2019s shortfall.\
  \ If need arises, then the development budget will be slashed down in order to keep\
  \ the budget deficit at around five percent of GDP.Finance Minister Ishaq Dar had\
  \ managed external front of the economy by keeping the IMF programme on track that\
  \ resulted in touching the foreign exchange reserves of $15 billion mark in December\
  \ 2014, as Islamabad got $1.1 billion from the IMF, as well as successfully launched\
  \ Sukuk bond worth $1 billion.Now the balance of payment crisis is over for the\
  \ short- and medium-term after increasing the foreign currency reserves and expected\
  \ saving in the import bill to the tune of $4 billion, but the worrisome indicator\
  \ is declining trends in fetching exports of Pakistani made-ups, which would become\
  \ headache for the economic managers on the long-term basis.There is a silver lining\
  \ on the economic front, as well. If Islamabad manages to attract committed Chinese\
  \ investment of over $40 billion and start moving towards materialising projects\
  \ under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), it can boost the sluggish economy\
  \ of Pakistan."

text: "Circular debt \u2013 a vicious cycle of unpaid bills\n                    \
  \        A recent report of the central bank said the problems in the energy system\
  \ have worsened as reflected in the persistence of load management and the re-emergence\
  \ of inter-corporate circular debt. Circular debt, - a vicious cycle of unpaid bills\
  \ running through the entire power-generation chain, swollen to nearly 2.0 percent\
  \ of GDP and has threaten the functioning of the energy sector.The government, to\
  \ limit the accumulation of circular debt, imposed a surcharge of Rs 0.30/unit from\
  \ October 2014 following soft crude prices. The adjustment implied an effective\
  \ increase of 2.5 percent in electricity tariffs and the government is planned to\
  \ make more adjustments in January and February 2015 to reduce electricity subsidies\
  \ to 0.7 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year.The current fiscal year started\
  \ on a positive note, when the government settled circular debt of Rs 500 billion\
  \ in June 2013. Furthermore, the Pakistan Muslim League\u2019s government was also\
  \ showed its committed to resolve the root causes for the power crisis. The government\
  \ then vowed to implement a time-bound plan to tackle price distortions; inadequate\
  \ collections; costly and poorly targeted subsidies; governance and regulatory deficiencies;\
  \ and low efficiency in the supply and distribution of energy. Unfortunately, most\
  \ of the needed reforms including privatization of distribution companies; increase\
  \ in household tariffs; price rationalization of CNG; and lower priority to households\
  \ in gas allocations, either could not be initiated, or made very slow progress.\
  \ The demand-supply gap hovered around 4,000 megawatt during the year showed a marked\
  \ deterioration.Qasim Niaz, Chairman IPPs Advisory Committee (IPPAC), said the government\
  \ has made some payments to the power producers to run their plants on maximum capacity\
  \ as hydroelectricity fell in winters. However, the initiative is not a sustainable\
  \ solution.\u201CThe government should avoid delay in payments, which would curtail\
  \ accumulation of circular debt and enable IPPs to run on maximum capacity,\u201D\
  \ Niaz said. Analysts said the vicious cycle of debt once again bogged down energy\
  \ supply chain as power distributors delay payments to generators who, in turn,\
  \ face difficulty in clearing dues of fuel suppliers like Pakistan State Oil.An\
  \ expansive fuel mix is partly blamed for the country\u2019s energy woes. The average\
  \ fuel component of generation cost on furnace oil has increased to Rs19/kilowatt\
  \ hour in 2013 from Rs12 in 2011, while generation cost on coal is around Rs3/unit.Still\
  \ there has been no significant progress made on the coal side. Although, a number\
  \ of power producers announced to convert on coal, none has been able to achieve\
  \ the financial close so far primarily because of the lethargic attitude of National\
  \ Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).\u201CVested interest groups mainly\
  \ the infamous oil mafia in the country, keep bringing up frivolous points against\
  \ coal, which is costing $700,000/day to consumers of Karachi,\u201D an official\
  \ of an IPP intending to convert on coal said. \u201CRunning 420 megawatts plant\
  \ on furnace oil costs $500 million a year and it would cost less than $250 million\
  \ on coal.\u201D\u201CThe addiction to oil is set to be replaced by addiction to\
  \ natural gas/LNG. LNG is better than oil but still more expensive than coal,\u201D\
  \ he said.The central bank report said energy conservation must be promoted to manage\
  \ the demand-supply gap in the short-run along with supply initiatives to find a\
  \ long-term solution of the issue. On the demand side, no policy initiative was\
  \ implemented to rationalize power consumption.The government though increased tariffs\
  \ in October; it was more focused on commercial and industries users, compared to\
  \ household users who are less productive from an economic point of view. Given\
  \ the need to rebalance power consumption between productive and non-productive\
  \ users, these tariff revisions could have been better targeted, the central bank\
  \ said.The bank believes that without bringing the consumption mix to a more optimum\
  \ level, the likelihood of exiting the ongoing power crisis is not promising.\u201C\
  Both natural gas and electricity tariffs for households need to be rationalized\
  \ to encourage households to invest in more efficient appliances and reduce wastage.\
  \ Ultimately, sustainable economic development will depend on changing the mindset\
  \ that cheap energy is a right, with a culture that encourages conservation and\
  \ productive usage,\u201D the bank said in its report.The IMF, in its December review,\
  \ notes that the supply shortages stem from a lack of sufficient installed capacity\
  \ to cover peak demand but also from the inability to keep installed plants running\
  \ at peak output due to shortages of gas and of money to provide sufficient fuel\
  \ oil in expensive oil-fired plants.\u201CThere are also significant line losses\
  \ in the distribution system due to inefficiencies and theft,\u201D IMF said.The\
  \ efficiency testing of fuel-based electricity generation companies and three rehabilitations\
  \ are expected to recover around 700 megawatts of capacity and increase efficiency\
  \ by 1\u20131.5 percent. In the medium-term, the government will complete construction\
  \ of an LNG terminal to ease gas shortages to increase electricity production, while\
  \ also encouraging higher domestic gas production.The government aims to promote\
  \ policies for private investment in power generation through both the entry of\
  \ new players as well as expanding existing capacity of those IPPs systematically\
  \ adhering to energy mix targets and least-cost generation plans. These expansions\
  \ are expected to generate additional 2,000 megawatts by 2016. Finally, in the longer-run\
  \ they are launching the development of several major hydropower projects."

  \ Adulterated food\u2019s unchecked availability across the city has created serious\
  \ health issues for hundreds of thousands of people owing to the poor performance\
  \ of Punjab Food Authority (PFA) during 2014.The Punjab Food Authority (PFA), which\
  \ is the sole authority to enforce food-related laws in the provincial metropolis,\
  \ has completely failed to ensure its presence and protect the people from adulterated\
  \ and unhygienic food and edibles.During the year, the PFA checked 103,099 shops,\
  \ hotels, restaurants, marriage halls, water plants, manufacturing units and etc\
  \ out of which it sealed only 2,181 entrepreneurs putting a question mark on its\
  \ performance.The authority also issued notices to only 24,164 businesses for unhygienic\
  \ conditions and in most of the cases the businesses were back to the same state\
  \ of affairs after some hours or the next day. During the whole year, the authority\
  \ collected only 10,577 samples of various edibles which were far less than the\
  \ perceived targets. Despite a hue and cry over adulterated food especially grains\
  \ and spices not a single sample was taken from Akbari Mandi, the biggest grain\
  \ and spices market in the provincial capital.The action and campaign of the PFA\
  \ against water filtration plants also failed as it only issued licences to 281\
  \ such plants while others continued to operate without any checks and balances.\
  \ It is pertinent to mention that most of these unregistered water filtration plants\
  \ are supplying tap water to the citizens in the name of mineral water and many\
  \ of them are suffering from dangerous diseases especially different types of hepatitis\
  \ due to these water plants.Milk adulteration remained on top of all the food items\
  \ and the PFA again failed to ensure supply of hygienic and nutritious milk to the\
  \ citizens during the year. The authority collected 4,300 milk samples out of which\
  \ 2,604 were rejected due to presence of dangerous chemicals. However, supply of\
  \ milk containing formolime, urea and other hazardous chemicals continued in the\
  \ nook and corner of the city.During the year 2014, the authority also failed to\
  \ check and ensure purity in the Ramazan, Model and Sasta Bazaars. Statistics show\
  \ that during the last Ramazan, the authority closed down only 15 stalls in all\
  \ the Ramazan and Model Bazaars of nine towns during 3,039 raids. During these raids,\
  \ the PFA teams only confiscated 38 kg Baisan, 114 kg Ketchup, 32 liter juice, 18\
  \ kg ghee, 32 kg salt, 3 kg corn floor, 4 kg Chat Masala, 11 kg Bhally, 62 kg pulses\
  \ and 2,353 liter juice.During the year, adulteration in food items from milk to\
  \ beverages, bottled water, fruit and vegetable products, oil and fats, spices,\
  \ tea, sauces, sweetening agents and sweets and backing products went on unchecked\
  \ in the provincial metropolis. Both low and high-priced category edibles were no\
  \ exception and one could easily find adulterated and contaminated items in the\
  \ city."

text: "State and religion\n                            A pressing question facing\
  \ today\u2019s Pakistan is the relationship between religion and the state. Should\
  \ the state be subordinate to religion? Should religion be subordinate to the state?\
  \ Or should the two be separate?Subordinating the state to religion means making\
  \ political as well as economic and cultural institutions primarily an instrument\
  \ of the propagation and enforcement of a particular creed. Such a view makes the\
  \ state an ideological entity existing solely to serve a religious purpose.On the\
  \ contrary, making religion subservient to the state means that religion, like other\
  \ social institutions, is an instrument to protect and advance state interest \u2013\
  \ generally described as national interest. The profession of a creed may be prohibited\
  \ in the interest of the dominant political ideology or narrative.Keeping the state\
  \ and religion separate means that neither would the state prescribe or promote,\
  \ nor would public resources be used, in the service of a particular creed. Neither\
  \ would the followers of a specific faith be accorded preferential treatment nor\
  \ would those professing other creeds be discriminated against. The state would\
  \ be secular \u2013 without an official dogma or religion.Every polity has to answer\
  \ this question one way or another with far-reaching socio-political implications.\
  \ How has our society answered this question? To understand this, let\u2019s go\
  \ back to the genesis of the country.The partition of British India was done on\
  \ the basis of religion; there was no other ground: linguistic, ethnic, racial,\
  \ or geographic. Muslim majority regions made up Pakistan \u2013 the rest went to\
  \ India. But what precisely was the purpose of the creation of Pakistan? Was it\
  \ to put in place an \u2018Islamic\u2019 state in the narrow sense of the term?\
  \ Or was it to safeguard the political, economic and cultural rights of the Muslims\
  \ \u2018endangered\u2019 in a united India?To date, opinion has remained sharply\
  \ divided on such questions. The founders of the country, who on their part were\
  \ liberal and westernised if not secular as well, did from time to time make statements\
  \ on the raison d\u2019\xEAtre of what at that time was the largest Muslim state\
  \ on the map of the world. But they were not always consistent \u2013 and understandably\
  \ so. Even if they were consistent, the controversy might not have been sorted out.The\
  \ first real test came when the Constituent Assembly began to draw up the first\
  \ constitution of the country. One of the causes behind the inordinate delay in\
  \ constitution making was the debate on the place religion would hold in the political\
  \ system. The present constitution of Pakistan, following the previous basic laws\
  \ of the land, has sought to answer the question of the state-religion relationship\
  \ by making Islam the state religion and incorporating some other Islamic provisions.\
  \ For instance: Both the president and prime minister have to be Muslim; principles\
  \ of democracy, tolerance, freedom, equality, and justice, as enunciated by Islam,\
  \ shall be fully observed in the country; Muslims shall be enabled to fashion their\
  \ lives as per Islamic teachings; and no law will be made, or continue to be in\
  \ force, which is in conflict with the canons of Islam.At the same time, the constitution\
  \ guarantees religious freedom by giving every citizen the right to \u2018profess,\
  \ practise and promote his religion\u2019. But has the state-religion relationship\
  \ question been adequately answered?Pakistan remains an overwhelmingly Muslim society.\
  \ So on the face of it, making Islam the state religion seems quite logical. But\
  \ within Muslims there are sects and sub-sects having deep, and at some points irreconcilable,\
  \ doctrinal differences. Not only that, there are progressive and retrogressive,\
  \ liberal and narrow, modern and primitive, forward-looking and reactionary interpretations\
  \ of Islam. So in case religion is given a paramount place in the polity, the first\
  \ question is which creed or interpretation should reign supreme. One may refer\
  \ here to the report authored by the late Justice Munir Ahmed on the 1953 Punjab\
  \ disturbances occasioned by a religious movement, which led to the imposition of\
  \ martial law in the province. The Munir Report, as it is commonly called, on the\
  \ basis of the author\u2019s dialogues with some leading Muslim clerics of different\
  \ sects, notes that they can\u2019t even agree on the definition of a Muslim. Here\
  \ is a passage from the report: \u201CThe net result of all this is that neither\
  \ Shias nor Sunnis nor Deobandis nor Ahl-e-Hadith nor Barelvis are Muslims, and\
  \ any change from one view to the other must be accompanied in an Islamic state\
  \ with the penalty of death, if the government of the state is in the hands of the\
  \ party which considers the other party to be kafirs. And it does not require much\
  \ imagination to judge the consequences of this doctrine, when it is remembered\
  \ that no two ulema have agreed before us as to the definition of a Muslim...\u201D\
  Not surprisingly, a Deobandi is reluctant to offer prayers led by a Barelvi. A Shia\
  \ hesitates to go to a mosque that is run by Sunnis.By the same token, the social\
  \ values of Islam are susceptible to a variety of interpretations. Take, for example,\
  \ justice. Does it consist in expeditious trial of the accused followed by on-the-spot\
  \ punishment in case of conviction, as touted by the exponents of the jirga system\
  \ as well as the Taliban? Or does justice lie in following the lengthy due process\
  \ of law, as represented by the formal judicial system? What is the Islamic concept\
  \ of democracy? We follow essentially the Westminster model of parliamentary democracy\
  \ but our parliament is called \u2018Majlis-e-Shura,\u2019 which is at best a consultative\
  \ forum and not a supreme legislature. On a retrogressive interpretation, parliamentary\
  \ democracy, based on majority vote and party system, is \u2018un-Islamic\u2019\
  . On a liberal interpretation, there is no inherent contradiction between the two.Are\
  \ Islam and pluralism mutually compatible or exclusive? If they are compatible,\
  \ a variety of creeds can co-exist with full religious freedom and reciprocal toleration.\
  \ If they are mutually exclusive, only one creed is entitled to exist and the rest\
  \ should either be converted or wiped out, not simply as a matter of policy but\
  \ as a religious obligation. This is what the Taliban ideology, of which a significant\
  \ section of our society is enamoured, essentially is. The Taliban kill in the name\
  \ of God.By making Islam the official religion, the state has taken upon itself\
  \ the task of making people good Muslims. But who is a good Muslim? Is it he who\
  \ prays five times a day but has no qualms about murdering those who do not measure\
  \ up to his standards of a good Muslim? Is it he who earns his or her living by\
  \ hard work? Or is it he who is compassionate and kind to his fellows irrespective\
  \ of their creed?More than 97 percent of Pakistanis are Muslims; Muslims also occupy\
  \ key slots in government, business and industry. So Islam has never been in danger\
  \ in Pakistan. But religious extremism, coming from Muslims and not non-Muslims\
  \ and feeding on a diabolical ideology, is eating into society. It is time we pondered\
  \ where we went wrong in establishing our state-religion relationship.The writer\

  \   KARACHI: Legal experts appeared skeptical on Wednesday as to whether finance\
  \ mangers followed the proper procedure in imposing an increase in sales tax on\
  \ petroleum products.They objected on the SRO issued by finance ministry, which\
  \ increased sales tax by 29.5 percent on POL products, saying that it should only\
  \ be act of parliament.\u201CThere are clear instructions in the Constitution and\
  \ Supreme Court orders regarding imposition of tax,\u201D Dr. Ikram ul Haq, advocate\
  \ Supreme Court and leading tax consultant said.A day earlier, the revenue division\
  \ of ministry of finance issued SRO 1152(I)/2014 to enhance the sales tax to 22\
  \ percent from 17 percent, effective January 01, 2015 in order to offset the decline\
  \ in revenue collection due to the oil price shocks.The revenue division issued\
  \ the notification exercising powers vested in clause b sub-section 2 of Section\
  \ 3 of Sales Tax Act, 1990, which allows the federal government to impose tax through\
  \ a notification.Dr. Haq, however, said the Supreme Court in Human Rights Case No\
  \ 14392 of 2013 [2014 PTD 243], combining many others, disapproved undue hikes in\
  \ utilities provided to people and in Iqbal Zafar Jhagra v Federation of Pakistan\
  \ (2014) declared levying of taxes through executive orders unconstitutional.The\
  \ government, despite such cases, which are binding under the Constitution, has\
  \ been resorting to infamous SROs for levy of taxes, he said and added: \u201CSuch\
  \ move of the government may be challenged in court of law.\u201DThe government\
  \ increased the sales tax considering sharp fall in prices of petroleum products\
  \ and a threat to revenue collection. The combined contribution of POL products\
  \ on imports and local supplies is about 40 percent towards total sales tax.Munawar\
  \ H. Shaikh, President, Pakistan Tax Bar Association said the government should\
  \ avoid taking such decision and should go to the parliament for appropriate approval.He\
  \ said the finance minister himself on several occasions announced elimination of\
  \ SRO culture.Another senior tax lawyer, requesting anonymity, said the Supreme\
  \ Court in its observation made in the order of 2013 that the parliament/ legislature\
  \ alone and not the government/executive is empowered to levy tax.The apex court\
  \ in the case also observed: \u201CAs far as delegation of such powers to the Government/Executive\
  \ is concerned, the same is for the purpose of implementation of such laws, which\
  \ is to be done by framing rules, or issuing notifications or guidelines, depending\
  \ upon case to case, as we have come across some of the cases noted hereinabove.\
  \ But in no case, authority to levy tax for the Federation is to be delegated to\
  \ the Government/Executive.\u201DThe lawyer, however, said at present different\
  \ sales tax rates are implemented, if considered Supreme Court judgment, all the\
  \ rates should be withdrawn.On the other hand, officials in Federal Board of Revenue\
  \ (FBR), said soft oil prices have dented sales tax revenue. \u201CIn addition,\
  \ the collection of advance income tax also started declining,\u201D said a FBR\
  \ official.Legal experts admitted the current revenue crisis but said the government\
  \ should present the revision in sales tax rate before the parliament, which is\
  \ summoned on January 1, 2015. They also suggested that the FBR should explore other\
  \ avenues such as broadening of tax base and bringing elites into tax net, who are\
  \ already identified by the tax authorities."

  \              IslamabadIn a bid to curb terrorist financing, Pakistan will have\
  \ to enact Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) law with the approval of Parliament and\
  \ synchronise legal mechanism at provincial levels for tracking down financiers\
  \ of terror groups. \"Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi was released by the court mainly because\
  \ neither Pakistan nor India put MLA in place so the dossier sent out by New Delhi\
  \ to Islamabad could not be held admissible as evidence before the court of law,\"\
  \ former caretaker law minister and expert on international law Bilal Ahmer Sufi\
  \ told reporters here on Tuesday. MLA, he said, was in place in UK and in many other\
  \ western countries. The military operation is just one aspect, which could be termed\
  \ as surgery but the government would have to put in place legal framework to move\
  \ ahead on blocking terror financing. He said the provincial governments would have\
  \ to enact laws in order to place effective mechanism on all those fronts where\
  \ powers were devolved under 18th constitutional amendment. A mutual legal assistance\
  \ treaty (MLAT) is an agreement between two or more countries for the purpose of\
  \ gathering and exchanging information in an effort to enforce public criminal laws.\
  \ The modern states have developed mechanisms for requesting and obtaining evidence\
  \ for criminal investigations and prosecutions. When evidence or other forms of\
  \ legal assistance, such as witnesses' statements or the service of documents are\
  \ needed from a foreign sovereign, states may attempt to cooperate informally through\
  \ their respective police agencies or, alternatively, resort to what is typically\
  \ referred to as requests for \"mutual legal assistance\". The practice of mutual\
  \ legal assistance developed from the comity-based system of letters rogatory, though\
  \ it is now far more common for states to make mutual legal assistance requests\
  \ directly to the designated \"Central Authorities\" within each state. In contemporary\
  \ practice, such requests may still be made on the basis of reciprocity but may\
  \ also be made pursuant to bilateral and multilateral treaties that obligate countries\
  \ to provide assistance. This assistance may take the form of examining and identifying\
  \ people, places and things, custodial transfers, and providing assistance with\
  \ the immobilisation of the instruments of criminal activity. With regard to the\
  \ latter, MLATs between the United States and Caribbean nations do not cover U.S.\
  \ tax evasion, and are therefore ineffective when applied to Caribbean countries,\
  \ which usually act as offshore tax havens. Assistance may be denied by either country\
  \ (according to agreement details) for political or security reasons, or if the\
  \ criminal offence in question is not equally punishable in both countries. Some\
  \ treaties may encourage assistance with legal aid for nationals in other countries.\
  \ Under the initiative of United Nations to counter terrorism, member states are\
  \ negotiating an additional international treaty, a draft comprehensive convention\
  \ on international terrorism. This convention would complement the existing framework\
  \ of international anti-terrorism instruments and would build on key guiding principles\
  \ already present in recent anti-terrorist conventions: the importance of criminalisation\
  \ of terrorist offences, making them punishable by law and calling for prosecution\
  \ or extradition of the perpetrators; the need to eliminate legislation which establishes\
  \ exceptions to such criminalisation on political, philosophical, ideological, racial,\
  \ ethnic, religious or similar grounds; a strong call for member states to take\
  \ action to prevent terrorist acts; and emphasis on the need for member states to\
  \ cooperate, exchange information and provide each other with the greatest measure\
  \ of assistance in connection with the prevention, investigation and prosecution\
  \ of terrorist acts."

text: "Promises didn\u2019t make Sindh any healthier in 2014\n                   \
  \         Karachi The year 2014 did not makes lives better for the people of Sindh\
  \ in terms of healthcare, and the provincial government stuck to merely making announcements\
  \ instead of actually starting new projects and facilitating the masses. Several\
  \ people died in Karachi of infectious diseases including dengue and Congo hemorrhagic\
  \ fever and the brain-eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, also claimed many lives.\
  \ The provincial health authorities, however, took no significant steps to improve\
  \ health facilities and the environmental conditions to control such outbreaks.\
  \ The battle with polio continued to suffer setbacks in the year as over two dozen\
  \ children were diagnosed with the disease, most of them in Karachi. The provincial\
  \ managers of the Expanded Program of Immunisation appeared helpless in eliminating\
  \ the disease. The provincial government\u2019s biggest failure was seen in Tharparkar,\
  \ where hundreds of children died of malnutrition and lack of basic health facilities.\
  \ Many women also lost their lives during childbirth.The government failed to provide\
  \ immediate and relief and avert the loss of lives in the drought-hit district.\
  \ The control of the health department returned to the Pakistan People\u2019s Party\
  \ after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement parted ways with the provincial government\
  \ and Jam Mehtab Dahar was appointed its minister replacing Dr Sagheer Ahmed in\
  \ October. The government announced several projects during the year to provide\
  \ more and better health facilities to the masses including five new medical colleges,\
  \ a rescue ambulance service, four blood transfusion centres with foreign funding\
  \ and seven thalassaemia centres, but none of these projects were started. The government\
  \ also announced that it would set up five new burns centres and an accident and\
  \ trauma centre but these projects could not kick off as well. The provincial budget\
  \ for the fiscal year 2014-15 contained allocations for the rescue ambulance service,\
  \ health call centres, a central diagnostic centre at the Civil hospital, expansion\
  \ of the OPDs at major hospitals in the province, a solar energy cold chain system\
  \ to maintain the efficacy of the vaccines and various other major and minor schemes,\
  \ but the government was unable to start working on them. In fact, the Benazir Bhutto\
  \ trauma and accident centre project, a project announced six years ago, could also\
  \ not be materialised this year. The provincial government had announced setting\
  \ up a major, tertiary-care hospital with 400 beds in Gulshan-e-Iqbal in Karachi.\
  \ But it failed to even perform its ground-breaking. Another area of neglect was\
  \ the promotion of medical education in the province. The previous coalition provincial\
  \ government of the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement had announced that it would\
  \ establish five new medical colleges and also laid their foundation stones. The\
  \ government had earmarked Rs1.14 billion for setting up these medical colleges\
  \ in Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Khairpur, Karachi and Hyderabad and they had to be completed\
  \ by 2014, but no headway was made in this regard too. The state of healthcare deteriorated\
  \ in the province, especially in Karachi, where three major hospitals were transferred\
  \ to provincial control after the 18th Constitutional Amendment. These services\
  \ at these hospitals suffered because of lack of attention, monitoring and funding\
  \ by the provincial government. The provincial government\u2019s inability to run\
  \ these hospitals can be gauged from the fact that it has recently announced privatising\
  \ the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, the National Institute of Child\
  \ Health and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. More than 5,000 patients died\
  \ during treatment at the JPMC alone during the outgoing year."

  \ massacre of children at the Army Public School in Peshawar \u2013 2014 may have\

  \ a mass outpouring of sympathy for Hamid Mir and Raza Rumi when they were the targets\
  \ of attempted murder. The latter had to flee the country because he is a bleeding\
  \ heart liberal who refuses to shut up; the former would have been okay if he just\
  \ kept to himself his belief on who targeted him.Instead, because Hamid Mir had\
  \ the temerity to use the news channel he works for to explain, through his brother,\
  \ the threats he received, the permanent power in the country (you know who it is)\
  \ decided to embark on an act of collective injustice, targeting not just the news\
  \ channel but the newspapers associated with the same media group and the employees\
  \ of the group. The channel was taken off the air by Pemra for 15 days for having\
  \ the temerity to report the news. Cable operators decided Geo did not pass go,\
  \ will not collect 200 dollars and will be banished to channel number 97 on the\
  \ cable order.Demonising Geo became a sport with everyone having a go at connecting\
  \ it to the various ills that have befallen the country. As he tends to do, Imran\
  \ Khan got the gold star for taking this game to this illogical extreme. During\

  \ it thinks the best target is an elected government \u2013 Imran managed to bundle\
  \ the news channel as part of the conspirators who had stolen an election that was\
  \ rightfully his. His proof of how a news organisation can stuff ballots? It broadcast\
  \ a victory speech by Nawaz Sharif before all the votes had been counted.The Imran-Qadri\
  \ dharnas were a useful barometer of how far we have descended as a country. There\
  \ was Sheikh Rashid, suddenly relevant again, promising \u2013 and achieving \u2013\
  \ blood on the streets. The PML-N government decided the best way to handle protests,\
  \ which is theoretically a right of all Pakistanis, no matter how misguided the\
  \ protest may be, was mowing down Qadri\u2019s supporters in Model Town. All this\
  \ over an election which, like all elections in the country, may have been flawed\
  \ but was better than most we have held.There was one bit of good news in 2014:\
  \ Malala Yousafzai became our second Nobel Laureate. Then we remembered that, like\
  \ our first, she too lives in exile. Many in the country hate her, believe she deserved\
  \ to be shot and killed, or that she faked her own shooting, or that she may have\
  \ been shot but she works for the CIA \u2013 so who cares?Malala isn\u2019t the\
  \ only person Pakistanis expressed a willingness to kill this year. There were also\
  \ the hordes of menacing polio workers, Hazaras, Christians, Ahmedis and schoolchildren.\
  \ Basically, if you weren\u2019t a Punjabi, Sunni male of means your time could\
  \ be up. If not now, we can always wait for next year when the hit-list will surely\
  \ be expanded.There was some good news too this year. The rupee gained against the\
  \ dollar which is good news for everyone except the dollar khor CIA agents who deserve\
  \ to be killed anyway. Javed Hashmi acted as our collective conscience which is\
  \ why he was aired out for a day or two and then promptly chucked to the back of\
  \ the closet. For the 67th year in a row, the state didn\u2019t officially execute\
  \ anyone convicted of blasphemy; it just left the dirty work to mobs, policemen\
  \ and prison guards. Pervez Musharraf is still around to fling his \u2018enlightened\

  \ The establishment of the proposed military courts was challenged in the Supreme\
  \ Court on Wednesday by a non-government organisation. Petitioner Altaf Shakoor,\
  \ president of PASBAN, stated in his application that after the Peshawar killings\
  \ the government\u2019s decision to set up military courts when anti-terrorism courts\
  \ were also working for the same purpose. He said the only reason cited by the government\
  \ for setting up military courts was the \u201Cincrease in terrorist activities\u201D\
  \ though police and other law-enforcement agencies had failed to protect the lives\
  \ of citizens and control the law and order situation. The petitioner stated that\
  \ the personnel of police and other law-enforcement agencies were not trained like\
  \ the armed forces in dealing with terrorists. He said it was necessary to train\
  \ law-enforcement personnel effectively so that they act against criminal elements\
  \ send them to courts for punishment. He said the government instead of removing\
  \ deficiencies in the police and law-enforcement agencies had resorted to inducting\
  \ military courts supervised by army personnel and such action was tantamount to\
  \ running a parallel judicial system in the country which was not only a violation\
  \ of the constitution but was also lethal for the democratic system. He said the\
  \ role of law-enforcement agencies in arresting culprits involved in terrorism used\
  \ to criticise unfair treatment and false implication of citizens due to political\
  \ influence, adding that in case military courts depended upon investigation of\
  \ the police the very purpose of right of fair trial guaranteed under the constitution\
  \ would be seriously affected. The military courts had been declared illegal by\
  \ the Supreme Court and formation of these courts would be a violation of the court\u2019\
  s decision, he contended.He requested the court to bar the government from making\
  \ amendments in the constitution by declaring formation of military courts illegal."

  \ believe that in the end Pakistan\u2019s success is my success, hence I am proud\
  \ of actors like Fawad Khan who represented the country in a positive manner\u201D\
  , says Faysal Quraishi, GEO TV\u2019s blockbuster \u2018Bashar Momin\u2019s lead\
  \ actor. The year 2014 left us all reeling with shocks and a great sense of loss\
  \ over the greatest human tragedies in Lahore and then in Peshawar this country\
  \ had ever witnessed since its inception. However, for some of the homely citizens,\
  \ especially women, Geo TV did bring a little joy in the otherwise highly disturbed\
  \ general public with its epic family oriented blockbusters like Bashar Momin, Ikraar,\
  \ and many other spellbinding presentations. One of the most inspiring television\
  \ personalities, who outshined many others owning to GEO TV network\u2019s memorable\
  \ plays, remains the brilliant young actor Faysal Quraishi. Having started on a\
  \ high note, 2014 definitely turned out to be an exciting year for Faysal Quraishi.\
  \ His grand project Bashar Momin went on to become one of the most watched serials\
  \ of the year. The lavish sets, gripping storyline and Faysal\u2019s on-screen chemistry\
  \ with actress Ushna Shah, received acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Besides\
  \ doing many other glamorous TV shows, Faysal also starred in a serious TV play\
  \ named Adhuri Aurat which dealt with a sensitive topic of breast cancer. He became\
  \ the first Pakistani celebrity to launch his own smart phone application and remained\
  \ as one of the most popular morning show hosts through his show on a TV channel.\
  \ His show Ikraar, where he stars opposite Resham, is currently being aired on GEO\
  \ TV and receiving a great response. Along with other popular Pakistani TV shows\
  \ that were handpicked to be aired in India, Faysal\u2019s Mano Salwa (renamed Tere\
  \ Ishq Mein) and Meri Zaat Zara-e-Benishaan (renamed Kaisi Yeh Qayamat) were two\
  \ of the most popular viewed shows across the border. After winning accolades in\
  \ Pakistan, the shows were welcomed in India with the same enthusiasm and resulted\
  \ in receiving a lot of fans\u2019 mails and interview requests by faysal from there.\
  \ Speaking about the success of his shows in 2014, Faysal said \u201CI am humbled\
  \ by the love India\u2019s viewers have given not only to my shows, but to all of\
  \ our Pakistani shows. Unfortunately the Peshawar incident left me so shaken that\
  \ all the happiness had paled in comparison. I cannot stop thinking about what has\
  \ happened and cannot focus on any future projects right now, although I have very\
  \ exciting plans for the New Year initially. May God show mercy on our country and\
  \ keep us and our children safe. That\u2019s my only expectation from 2015\u201D\
  . Faysal Quraishi began his acting career at the tender age of six when he first\
  \ appeared in a PTV\u2019s play Emergency Ward. As a child he also appeared in the\
  \ drama, Andhera Ujala. At the age of 18 Faysal starred in a movie Saza. Four short\
  \ years and 19 films later Faysal Quraishi quit the movie industry and pursued a\
  \ career in the television drama acting instead. His first major appearance in the\
  \ TV acting was a role as Boota in Tooba Tek Singh. Faysal began acting in television\
  \ in 1999 following which in 2003 he hosted his first show with Showbiz Pakistan\
  \ after which he also hosted Hero Bannay Ke Tarang and was a judge on Pakistan Next\
  \ Mega Star and Nachle."

  \      ISLAMABAD: The Nawaz Sharif government has no majority in the Senate and\

  \ weak.\u201CSince the new amendments will have far-reaching implications, we will\
  \ work for an accord among the parliamentary parties,\u201D a senior Pakistan Muslim\
  \ League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader told The News. He said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\
  \ was conscious of the fact that no amendments would be forced without evolving\
  \ a consensus. \u201CUnanimity is essential for such steps. There is no question\
  \ of bulldozing the amendments.\u201DOvert and coverts moves are being undertaken\
  \ by the prime minister and his aides to work out a consensus on the package of\
  \ amendments prepared by the government. Nawaz Sharif has asked a set of ministers\
  \ to initiate dialogue with the parliamentary parties to remove their reservations.The\
  \ PML-N leader said that some parties are unnecessarily trying to create controversies\
  \ about the creation of the military courts although all of them had agreed to the\
  \ proposal in the December 24 conclave, which was also attended by Chief of Army\
  \ Staff (COAS) General Raheel Sharif and Director General of the Inter-Services\
  \ Intelligence (ISI) Lt-Gen Rizwan Akhtar.While addressing the Senate on Wednesday,\
  \ the prime minister was sure that all the parties would unanimously pass the fresh\
  \ amendments. \u201CWe have formulated an outline of the constitutional amendment\
  \ that would be cleared by the parliament soon. The National Action Plan (NAP) is\
  \ not the decision of one man, but the entire national leadership. We are in a state\
  \ of war and extraordinary measures are warranted to deal with the scourge of terrorism.\u201D\
  In Tuesday\u2019s meeting of constitutional experts belonging to different parties,\
  \ the PPP rejected the comprehensive constitutional amendment prepared by the attorney\
  \ general. Instead PPP representative Aitzaz Ahsan presented a brief modification\
  \ in an ordinary law to establish military courts and held the view that there was\
  \ no need of constitutional amendment for the purpose. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\
  \ (PTI) nominee Hamid Khan had dismissed the proposal of setting up military courts\
  \ altogether although his chief Imran Khan had consented to it in the December 24\
  \ meeting.In the National Assembly, the PML-N has a total of 189 seats apart from\
  \ the support of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl, National Party, Federally Administered\
  \ Tribal Areas (Fata) members and some smaller groups. However, when Nawaz Sharif\
  \ was elected as prime minister in 2013, he had clinched sixteen votes more than\
  \ the dreamy two-thirds majority. The two-thirds figure precisely comes to 228 MPs\
  \ while Nawaz Sharif had secured 244 votes.The PML-N has only 14 senators - 13 from\
  \ Punjab, just one from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and none from Sindh and Balochistan.\
  \ With the addition of one member each of the National Party of Hasil Bizenjo and\
  \ Balochistan Chief Minister Dr Abdul Malik, and PML-Functional, the ruling coalition\u2019\
  s tally comes to 23 senators. Then, there are twelve senators from Fata, who generally\
  \ side with the government.The PPP is the single largest party in the Senate having\
  \ forty plus members and has its nominees as its chairman and deputy chairman for\
  \ the first time.The PTI has no representation whatsoever in the Senate. It has\
  \ less than thirty members in the National Assembly minus its defectors, but its\
  \ MPs including Imran Khan refuse to attend the House proceedings saying that they\
  \ have tendered resignations.From day one, the Nawaz Sharif government has been\
  \ uncomfortable with the Senate for not having majority in it. It cherishes a previous\
  \ record of fast legislation but it has not been able to keep that up during its\
  \ present stint due to its poor numerical position in the Senate. It was for this\
  \ reason that Nawaz Sharif has mostly stayed away from the Upper House. He has been\
  \ eagerly waiting for February when he will secure majority in the Senate."

  \ Niaz Mohammad, who was executed the other day in Peshawar Central Prison for trying\
  \ to kill General Pervez Musharraf, used to be a former technician of the Pakistan\
  \ Air Force, who was a close aide of Adnan Rasheed, the chief operational commander\
  \ of the TTP-linked Ansarul Aseer (Helpers of the Prisoners) - a lethal jehadi unit\
  \ which was founded to secure freedom for the imprisoned jehadis by conducting jail\
  \ break operations.Of the seven people hanged so far since the lifting of the moratorium\
  \ on executions last month, six had been involved in two abortive attempts to assassinate\
  \ Pervez Musharraf eleven years ago in Rawalpindi in December 2003. The remaining\
  \ one - Aqeel alias Dr Usman - had also tried to target Musharraf\u2019s plane at\
  \ Chaklala Airport in Rawalpindi with a shoulder missile. However, he was handed\
  \ down a death sentence and sent to the gallows for spearheading the October 10,\
  \ 2009 fidayeen attack targeting the General Headquarters of the Pakistan Army in\
  \ Rawalpindi. Of the seven people hanged so far over the past fortnight, four were\
  \ civilians. While Aqeel alias Dr Usman and Arshad Mahmood alias Mehrban, who were\
  \ hanged in Faisalabad on December 22, belonged to the Pakistan Army, Niaz Mohammad,\
  \ who was executed in Peshawar on December 31, was a PAF employee. Niaz, a resident\
  \ of Yar Hussain area in Swabi district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was kept at the Haripur\
  \ Central Prison until December 30 when he was shifted to Peshawar Central Prison\
  \ in a helicopter, before being executed. According to the military circles, in\
  \ the first assassination attempt on Musharraf, which took place near Jhanda Chichi\
  \ bridge in Rawalpindi on December 14, 2003, six PAF personnel were convicted by\
  \ a field general court martial at the PAF Base Chaklala on October 3, 2005. Besides\
  \ Niaz, four more PAF personnel were also sentenced to death that also included\
  \ a former junior technician Adnan Rashid, who later escaped during the 2012 Bannu\
  \ jailbreak and later joined hands with the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. The other\
  \ three PAF personnel included former chief technician Khalid Mahmood, former senior\
  \ technician Karam Din, and former corporal, Nawazish. The sixth convict, Nasrullah,\
  \ a junior technician, was sentenced to life imprisonment. A PAF appellate court\
  \ dismissed the joint appeal of the six accused in February 2006. Almost a month\
  \ later, on March 28, 2006, the Lahore High Court also dismissed their petitions.\
  \ Six months later, a Supreme Court bench headed by then Chief Justice Iftikhar\
  \ Mohammad Chaudhry had rejected their appeals against the high court verdict [on\
  \ September 25, 2006]. The bench held that under Article 199 of the Constitution,\
  \ civil courts had no jurisdiction to issue writ against orders passed by the military\
  \ courts. In petitions, Niaz Mohammad and other five convicts had alleged they had\
  \ falsely been implicated in the case. They claimed they had voted against General\
  \ Musharraf in the 2002 referendum and, therefore, they were picked up by the agencies\
  \ following the 2003 attempts on his life, only to be kept in illegal detention\
  \ during which they were severely tortured.The proximity between Niaz Mohammad and\
  \ Adnan Rasheed can be gauged from the fact that they had spent most of their prison\
  \ term together, unlike the other four PAF personnel. In September 2011, Adnan Rasheed\
  \ and his comrade Niaz Khan were shifted from Haripur central jail to Peshawar prison.\
  \ The transfer was against their wishes and both prisoners went on a hunger strike\
  \ in protest. Adnan used to be the prayer leader in the Haripur Jail and had a strong\
  \ influence over the prisoners. In 2011, Adnan and Niaz ensured that Eid was celebrated\
  \ on two different days in Haripur Jail, as per the custom in Khyber Pakthunkhwa\
  \ province, where majority of the rigid clerics do not celebrate Eid with the government.\
  \ As they refused to end their hunger strike, Adnan and Niaz were shifted to two\
  \ separate jails - Adnan was lodged in the Bannu Jail while Niaz was taken to the\
  \ Mansehra District Jail.Therefore, while Adnan was freed by the Taliban in the\
  \ 2012 Bannu jailbreak operation, Niaz stayed behind bars because of being in another\
  \ jail, only to be executed the other day. Adnan was freed on April 15, 2012 when\
  \ around 200 Taliban militants armed with guns, grenades and rockets attacked the\
  \ high-security Bannu Central Jail and released 384 prisoners. The then TTP spokesman\
  \ Ehsanullah Ehsan had subsequently declared on April 20, 2012 that the operation\
  \ was mainly aimed at freeing Adnan. Ehsanullah had added that the Taliban had been\
  \ working on the jailbreak plan for several months and that they had been in touch\
  \ with Adnan and some other prisoners in the Bannu Central Jail.Interestingly, despite\
  \ being an al-Qaeda linked convicted terrorist, Adnan was allowed to get married\
  \ in the jail in 2010 and become father of a daughter. Adnan Rasheed actually worked\
  \ for Amjad Farooqi, the al-Qaeda-linked Lashkar-e-Jhangvi terrorist who had engineered\
  \ the twin suicide attacks against Musharraf at the behest of al-Qaeda leader Abu\
  \ Faraj al Libi. Coming from Chota Lahore village of the Swabi district, Adnan had\
  \ joined the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in 1997, before being arrested for his role\
  \ in an attempt to kill Musharraf in Rawalpindi on December 14, 2003. He has already\
  \ been elevated as the chief operational commander of a lethal fidayeen unit of\
  \ TTP - Ansarul Aseer whose stated mission is to secure freedom for imprisoned jehadis\
  \ by conducting jailbreak operations. In a video-taped message released on March\
  \ 25, 2013, Adnan had threatened to assassinate Musharraf, adding that he has constituted\
  \ a death squad which would hunt down the former dictator for having ordered the\
  \ 2007 Lal Masjid massacre.Since his release, he has led several guerrilla operations\
  \ - the most significant being the July 30, 2013 Dera Ismail Khan jailbreak raid\
  \ in which 275 most wanted militants were freed. Almost a month before conducting\
  \ DI Khan raid, Adnan had claimed in a rare interview that he was indoctrinated\
  \ by a covert jehadi group which recruits officers from the three military services\
  \ and utilises them to wage jehad along with the Taliban. The interview was published\
  \ in the May 2013 issue of an English-language jehadi magazine \u201CAzan\u201D\
  \ which was launched by the Taliban elements, primarily to cater the educated Muslims.\
  \ Adnan had claimed that his first jehadi inclination emerged when the Indians were\
  \ compelled to release Maulana Masood Azhar after the 2000 hijacking of an Indian\
  \ plane. He said he was about to travel to Germany for higher education when the\
  \ 9/11 terrorist attacks took place and his colleagues in the PAF persuaded him\
  \ to pursue the jehadi path. In a latest development, while refuting the rumours\
  \ of his death in the ongoing military operation in Waziristan, Adnan Rasheed has\
  \ appeared in a video message [released on December 30, 2014], accusing the Pakistani\
  \ establishment of taking a U-turn after using militants in Jammu Kashmir and Afghanistan\
  \ and labeling them as terrorists. Following his trusted aide Niaz Mohammad\u2019\
  s execution the other day, the next PAF personnel to be executed for trying to kill\
  \ Musharraf is a former chief technician of the PAF, Khalid Mehmood who was associated\
  \ with 310 GC Wing and comes from Dunyapur area of the Lodhran district in Punjab."

text: "Political parties fear military courts may target them\n                  \
  \          ISLAMABAD: A primary reason behind expressing reservations to creation\
  \ of military courts by some political parties is their strong apprehension that\
  \ these forums might be used against politicians.Whether any political party has\
  \ publicly aired such fears or not, every one of them has substantial worries in\
  \ the back of their mind that politicians may fall victim to such courts.However,\
  \ this fear apart, no parliamentary party is opposed to the establishment of military\
  \ courts if they exclusively try terrorists because all want elimination of terrorism\
  \ by employing every possible means and tool. All political forces want conviction\
  \ of militants on fast-track basis.Every parliamentary force including even the\
  \ ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had consented to the proposal, though\
  \ hesitantly, after exhaustive discussions. \u201CWe are sure that the parliamentary\
  \ parties will agree to the creation of these courts at the end of the day as we\
  \ are trying to allay their apprehensions,\u201D a senior source which is part of\
  \ the high-level consultations presided over by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif told\
  \ The News.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which has now partially differed\
  \ with the proposal, had stamped its approval on it during the December 24 second\
  \ meeting of the top parliamentary leaders, which was also attended by Chief of\
  \ Army Staff (COAS) General Raheel Sharif and Director General of the Inter-Services\
  \ (ISI) Lt-Gen Rizwan Akhtar.When the recommendation was floated in the lengthy\
  \ session, PTI Chairman Imran Khan had sought time to mull over it but endorsed\
  \ it just after half an hour in the same deliberations.However, his nominee, Hamid\
  \ Khan, advocate, held the view in Monday\u2019s meeting of constitutional experts\
  \ that the PTI was opposed to the military courts. On the other hand, PTI Information\
  \ Secretary Dr Shireen Mazari quickly contradicted Hamid Khan saying that her party\
  \ was not against such bodies. Confusion about the PTI\u2019s policy has unnecessarily\
  \ been spawned.Almost same is the case with the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP).\
  \ In the December 24 discussions, its representatives had also agreed to the proposal.\
  \ The biggest support, though slightly conditional, to the setting up of the military\
  \ courts had come from a person no less than PPP chief and former president Asif\
  \ Ali Zardari. He had stated at the death anniversary congregation of Benazir Bhutto\
  \ in Garhi Khuda Bux on December 27 that his party has backed the recommendation\
  \ with the condition that these courts will not target politicians.However, PPP\
  \ Senator Raza Rabbani has now expressed reservations over military courts and advised\
  \ the government to learn lessons from thepast as two civilian regimes were toppled\
  \ by martial laws. It was always during the PML-N stints that such courts were set\
  \ up, he said.However, PPP Senator Aitzaz simplified the creation of military courts\
  \ saying that they can be established by bringing about a change in an ordinary\
  \ law that the Parliament can pass with a simple majority, and there is no need\
  \ of any constitutional amendment. \u201CWe rejected the draft presented by the\
  \ attorney general in Monday\u2019s meeting and offered a very brief and simple\
  \ amendment in a law to satisfy the mandate of the December 24 deliberations.\u201D\
  Former Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has also described the proposed\
  \ setting up of military courts as unconstitutional. \u201CMilitary courts are illegal\
  \ and unconstitutional. The basic structure of the Constitution guarantees an independent\
  \ judiciary, and military courts cannot be created in the presence of an independent\
  \ judiciary.\u201DThe Jamaat-e-Islami was the first political party that had stood\
  \ against the idea of military courts. But in the December 24 session, it too had\
  \ changed its mind, though reluctantly. The political parties continue to highlight\
  \ their fears and apprehensions despite the fact that General Raheel Sharif has\
  \ categorically assured the parliamentary leaders that he guarantees that these\
  \ forums would only try \u2018jet black terrorists\u2019 with the objective of getting\
  \ rid of the scourge of terrorism and would not arraign any political figure.The\
  \ parliamentary parties, which concurred to the proposal in the presence of the\
  \ COAS but are disapproving it afterward, are following a hypocritical policy. It\
  \ is quite possible that they will be fully on board after another meeting on the\
  \ pattern of the one held on December 24.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has made it\
  \ clear that the creation of the military courts is part of the 20-point National\
  \ Action Plan (NAP), which was unanimously approved by all the parliamentary parties.As\
  \ per the NAP, the military courts are to function for two years. As they try and\
  \ convict hardcore terrorists, the government may use this period to massively rectify\
  \ the normal criminal justice system so as to enable it to meet the new challenges.The\
  \ final go-ahead to the establishment of military courts from all the parliamentary\
  \ parties may be forthcoming with some more discussions and efforts by the prime\
  \ minister and the army leadership. But the biggest test these forums will face\
  \ will come when they will be challenged in a superior court especially in view\
  \ of the fact that the Supreme Court had declared such tribunals null and void back\
  \ in 1999.Generally, the superior courts treat special tribunals as a parallel judiciary,\
  \ which, they are sure, is not allowed under the Constitution. Whenever special\
  \ courts have been disputed at a judicial forum, superior courts have been laying\
  \ down strict guidelines to be followed by them where the parties involved are given\
  \ the due right of hearing, defence and appeal."

text: "PTI regime to follow the Swedish governance model\nLAHORE: Premier Imran Khan-led\
  \ Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is reportedly going to follow the transparent governance\
  \ model of Sweden, which has the lowest levels of national debt, low and stable\
  \ inflation and a relatively healthy banking system among the European Union states,\
  \ research conducted by the \"Jang Group and Geo Television Network\" shows.Few\
  \ vital demographic and economic facts about Sweden: At 450,295 square kilometres,\
  \ Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area. Sweden has\
  \ a total population of 10.2 million, of which 2.4 million has a foreign background.\
  \ According to the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition, only\
  \ 30.7% of Swedes live in urban areas The total nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\
  \ of Sweden is over $601 billion, twice that of Pakistan!The nominal Swedish Per\
  \ Capita GDP is $58,345. Sweden is the 32nd largest export economy in the world.\
  \ In 2016, Sweden exported commodities totaling $133 billion and imported goods\
  \ worth $131 billion, resulting in a positive trade balance of $2.39 billion. In\
  \ 2016, Sweden had a tax-to-GDP ratio of 44.1% compared with the 36-member OECD's\
  \ average of 34.3% and compared to Pakistan's dismal 12.5 %. The enviable Swedish\
  \ road to success:According to Swedish government's official websites, the country's\
  \ economy used to suffer from low growth and high inflation, and the Swedish krona\
  \ was repeatedly devalued. Sweden was also hit by a deep financial crisis in the\
  \ early 1990s. Banks became unstable and two were nationalized, unemployment rose\
  \ rapidly, government spending got out of control, and so did Sweden\u2019s national\
  \ debt. The road back to stability and success was not easy for Sweden. But by pursuing\
  \ inventive and courageous reforms and sticking to them, Sweden has transformed\
  \ its economy and stayed strong in the face of the new global recession. Since the\
  \ crisis of the 1990s, successive Swedish governments have been balancing the budget\
  \ for over a decade, and have continued to do so even in the wake of the 2007\u2013\
  2008 global financial crises. Sweden reinvented its economic governance with a series\
  \ of innovative regulations. First, in 1996 a ceiling for government expenditures\
  \ was introduced. This was accompanied by the addition of the \u2018surplus goal\u2019\
  \ for the government budget. These reforms have met with broad support from across\
  \ the political spectrum in Sweden. They help ensure that high debt doesn\u2019\
  t accumulate and that debt isn\u2019t passed on to future generations.Additionally,\
  \ in 2007 the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council was established. This committee of experts\
  \ audits the government\u2019s policy decisions regarding public finances and aims\
  \ to ensure that they remain consistent with the goals of growth, employment and\
  \ long-term financial sustainability. The Swedish government\u2019s credible management\
  \ of the public finances has meant that Sweden remains in the top league of fiscally\
  \ responsible countries in Europe. While governments with large budget deficits\
  \ carry out austerity measures by increasing taxes and cutting public spending,\
  \ Sweden has avoided these difficulties. In fact, taxes in Sweden have actually\
  \ been lowered since the crisis began. Sweden has also continued to invest in areas\
  \ like healthcare, education and research, instead of having to cut heavily in these\
  \ areas like in some countries. Research shows that the parliamentary democracy\
  \ of Sweden has three levels of government: national, regional and local. Approximately\
  \ seven million people in the country entitled to vote in this Scandinavian nation\
  \ with thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes, along with vast boreal forests\
  \ and glaciated mountains. At parliamentary, municipal and county council elections\
  \ held every four years, voters elect those who are to decide how Sweden is governed\
  \ and administered.National level: At the national level, the Swedish people are\
  \ represented by the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) which has legislative powers.\
  \ Proposals for new laws are presented by the Government which also implements decisions\
  \ taken by the Riksdag. The Government is assisted in its work by the Government\
  \ Offices, comprising a number of ministries, and some 400 central government agencies\
  \ and public administrations. The Government implements the Riksdag's decisions\
  \ and draws up proposals for new laws or law amendments. There are many ways of\
  \ influencing Swedish politics, for example by taking part in referendums, joining\
  \ a political party or sending in your comments on reports presented by the Government.Regional\
  \ level: Sweden is divided into 21 counties. Political tasks at this level are undertaken\
  \ on the one hand by the county councils, whose decision-makers are directly elected\
  \ by the people of the county and, on the other, by the county administrative boards\
  \ which are government bodies in the counties. Some public authorities also operate\
  \ at regional and local levels, for example through county boards.Local level: Sweden\
  \ has 290 municipalities. Each municipality has an elected assembly, the municipal\
  \ council, which takes decisions on municipal matters. The municipal council appoints\
  \ the municipal executive board, which leads and coordinates municipality work.The\
  \ Constitution: Basic provisions defining how Sweden shall be governed are enshrined\
  \ in the Constitution. In these fundamental laws the relationship between decision-making\
  \ and executive power is set out and also the freedoms and rights enjoyed by citizens.\
  \ Among other things, the Instrument of Government guarantees citizens the right\
  \ to freely procure information, hold demonstrations, form political parties and\
  \ practice their religion.The Freedom of the Press Act: In another of the fundamental\
  \ laws, the Freedom of the Press Act, the principle of public access to official\
  \ documents is set out in order to guarantee an open society with access to information\
  \ about the work of the Riksdag, the Government and public agencies. This openness\
  \ entitles the Swedish people to study official documents. Anyone may avail him/herself\
  \ of this possibility whenever they wish.Division of responsibility between levels\
  \ of government: The Swedish Constitution contains provisions defining the relationship\
  \ between decision-making and executive power. The 1992 Swedish Local Government\
  \ Act regulates division into municipalities and the organization and powers of\
  \ the municipalities and county councils. It also contains rules for elected representatives,\
  \ municipal councils, executive boards and committees.The division of tasks between\
  \ central government and municipalities has changed over the years. Activities have\
  \ chiefly been transferred from central government to municipal bodies, inter alia\
  \ for democratic reasons. In municipalities it is easier to maintain continuous\
  \ contact between decision-makers and the private individual The Government has\
  \ appointed a parliamentary committee, the Committee on Public Sector Responsibilities,\
  \ which has been instructed to look into the division of responsibility between\
  \ different levels of government In addition, there is the European level which\
  \ has acquired increasing importance following Sweden's entry into the European\
  \ Union.The European level: On entering the EU in 1995, Sweden acquired a further\
  \ level of government: the European level. As a member of the Union, Sweden takes\
  \ part in the decision-making process when new common rules are drafted and approved.\
  \ Sweden is represented by the Government in the European Council of Ministers,\
  \ which is the EU's principal decision-making body.{C}{C}to assume charge as Governors\
  \ of Punjab. Till date since 1970, most of the Punjab Governors have hailed from\
  \ Pakistan People\u2019s Party and late Salman Taseer remains the only unfortunate\
  \ one to be assassinated in office. The post-1970 Punjab Governors (Acting and permanent)\
  \ include:Lt General Attiqur Rahman, Ghulam Mustafa Khar, Hanif Ramay, Nawab Sadiq\
  \ Hussain Qureshi, Mohammad Abbas Khan Abbasi, Aslam Riaz Hussain, Vice Chief of\
  \ Army Staff Lt. General Sawar Khan, Lt. General Ghulam Jilani Khan, Makhdoom Sajjad\
  \ Hussain Qureshi, Pakistan\u2019s former Army Chief General Tikka Khan, Mian Muhammad\
  \ Azhar, Chaudhary Altaf Hussain, Lt General Raja Saroop Khan, Khawaja Tariq Rahim,\
  \ Shahid Hamid, Zulfiqar Ali Khosa, Lt General Muhammad Safdar, Lt General Khalid\
  \ Maqbool, Salmaan Taseer, Rana Iqbal Khan between January 4 and January 13, 2011\
  \ after Taseer\u2019s assanination, Latif Khosa, Makhdoom Ahmed Mahmood, Chaudhary\
  \ Muhammad Sarwar, Rana Iqbal and Rafique Rajwana.There have been a few occasions\
  \ when Punjab was administratively controlled by Governors only. These were the\
  \ times of the Martial Laws of 1958-1972 and 1977-1985, and Governor Rules of 1999-2002.\
  \ In the case of Punjab, there was direct governor rule in 1949-1951, when the provincial\
  \ chief minister of that time was removed and assemblies were dissolved. Very few\
  \ people would know that covered by lush-green sprawling lawns, the Governor's House\
  \ Lahore was build around the tomb of Mohammed Kasim Khan (died 1635), a cousin\
  \ of the Mughal emperor Akbar. Kasim Khan, as chronicles of history reveal, was\
  \ a great patron of sports, and near his grave is a \"kushtee gumbaz\" or the dome\
  \ of the wrestlers.The famous \"Darbar Hall\" of the Governor's House Lahore found\
  \ its name after the Prince of Wales wanted to hold a darbar (open public court)\
  \ here. Hence, a magnificent room with a high oak ceiling and a balustrade balcony\
  \ running all round was built for the British Prince to hold a court. The balcony\
  \ of the \"Darbar Hall\" at Governor's House Lahore still has painted portraits\
  \ of the British administrators of Lahore."

  \ weeks extension in the deadline. The deadline was extended after poor response\
  \ was due to some strict conditions regarding eligibility criteria as majority of\

  \ had fixed November 28, 2014 last date for the submission of applications under\
  \ Apna Rozgar Scheme for providing pick-up vans to unemployed people in the province\
  \ on five-year long mark-up free payment plan. Realising lacklustre response of\
  \ people due to some conditions the criteria was later amended and last date extended\
  \ to December 15, 2014. For the applicants, age limit was fixed between 21 to 35\
  \ years in the matriculation qualification and valid driving licence issued on or\
  \ before October 31, 2014. The criteria was later amended as majority of the interested\
  \ applicants did not have valid driving licence, required academic certificate and\
  \ age. The government increased the age limit up to 40 years, no minimum education\
  \ and driving licence issued till last date of submission of applications, i.e.\
  \ December 15, 2014. The steering committee of Chief Minister Apna Rozgar Scheme\
  \ held a meeting after receiving applications from across the Punjab which was exceeded\
  \ to 150,000. As per the plan, the government has decided to give 50,000 vehicles.\
  \ However, more than 125,000 applications have been received for Suzuki Bolan against\
  \ the approved 25,000 vehicles and over 25,000 applications for Suzuki Ravi against\
  \ 25,000 vehicles. Out of every five applicants, one will get Suzuki Bolan vehicle\
  \ application while in Suzuki Ravi category, majority of the applicants will succeed\
  \ in getting vehicles even without balloting due to limited number of applications.\
  \ The members of the Steering Committee talking to The News confirmed that more\
  \ than 150,000 applications received under the Chief Minister Apna Rozgar Scheme.\
  \ It was decided that balloting of the applications should be started in the first\
  \ week of January, 2015. The committees would set up at the district and divisional\
  \ levels for the balloting of the applicants which would be completed by the first\
  \ week of January 2015, they said. Under the scheme, quota of the vehicles has been\
  \ divided among the districts on population basis which is further bifurcated to\
  \ 50-50 for each Suzuki Bolan and Suzuki Ravi. In the case of Suzuki Bolan, applications\
  \ received from each district are more than the assigned quota while in Suzuki Ravi\
  \ case, applications from districts of North and Central Punjab, are less than the\
  \ quota. Thus, almost all the applicants of Suzuki Ravi from these districts will\
  \ be successful even without balloting. The balloting will be held for Suzuki Bolan\

text: "Land record couldn\u2019t be computerised in 2014\n                       \
  \     LAHORETHE dream of completing a historical World Bank funded land record computerisation\
  \ project could not come true in the year 2014 despite tall claims made by Punjab\
  \ Chief Minister Mian Shahbaz Sharif in the said context. The first deadline to\
  \ complete the historical project was set for June 2014 and later December 2014\
  \ by the CM but computerisation of the land record could only be completed in 20\
  \ districts including Kasur, Sheikhupura, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Nankana Sahib,\
  \ Jhang, Jhelum, Lodhran, and Lahore out of total 36 districts of the province.\
  \ Similarly, around 12,500 muzaz out of total 23,000 were computerised in the year\
  \ 2014 in comparison with 2,500 muzaz which were completed in the year 2013. Besides\
  \ this, Arazi Record Centres have also been established in 143 tehsils of the province\
  \ during 2014 to provide further benefit to the masses. Now the project is expected\
  \ to be completed by June 2015. In those districts where the new system has started\
  \ working, any citizen can get the record of his piece of land in just 30 minutes\
  \ while transfer record can be made available within 50 minutes only. The computerisation\
  \ of land record has also made the process of getting \u2018Fard\u2019 more friendly\
  \ and the legal fee of Fard has also been reduced to Rs 150. It is expected that\
  \ when this modern system became fully functional in all the districts of the province,\
  \ the culture of corruption, bribery and forgery in the matters related to land\
  \ would be eliminated and the people would get rid of exploitative system of Patwaris\
  \ and Tehsildars. Due to computerisation of land record, the threat of theft and\
  \ loss of documents in fire or flood will also be minimised. It is pertinent to\
  \ mention here that the project \u2018Land Record Computerisation\u2019 was initiated\
  \ by Ch Pervaiz Elahi as a pilot project. The aim of the project was to get rid\
  \ the province of corrupt practices and irregularities of Patwaris and other revenue\
  \ officers. The project moved ahead very slowly every year. Designed by the Project\
  \ Management Unit, the project was recommended to the World Bank Board for funding\
  \ in 2006 and subsequently the Project Financing Agreement was signed on February\
  \ 28, 2007. During the previous era of incumbent PML-N\u2019s provincial government,\
  \ nothing tangible work could be done on the project and the project was delayed\
  \ further mainly because of delay in the software development and selection process\
  \ which was expected to be completed by the end of 2008. Similarly, implementation\
  \ of the project in four districts of the province, to be initiated in 2009, got\
  \ delayed. After the software development, the work on computerising the land record\
  \ got underway in the Punjab to facilitate more than 20 million land owners of the\
  \ province. To expand the Land Record Management Information Systems project in\
  \ the entire Punjab by CM Shahbaz Sharif was the other reason for the delay in the\
  \ completion of the project as initially the project was to be implemented in only\
  \ half of the districts of the province. Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad\
  \ Shahbaz Sharif presided over a high level meeting on Wednesday which reviewed\
  \ in detail the progress of the Land Record Management Information System. According\
  \ to a handout issued on Wednesday, addressing the meeting, the chief minister said\
  \ that the land record computerisation service centres had been made operational\
  \ in all the 143 tehsils of the province. He said through the computerisation of\
  \ land record issuance of proprietary deed had been ensured within 30 minutes which\
  \ would provide substantial relief to citizens as well as rid them of obsolete Patwar\
  \ Culture. He said the computerisation of land record had been completed in 20 districts\
  \ and online system at 92 service centres had been linked with a consolidated system.\
  \ He further said the process of Google mapping with regard to land had been completed\
  \ in three districts. The CM directed that the programme of Google mapping of the\
  \ land be extended to the whole province and an effective awareness campaign be\
  \ initiated regarding the importance of the project. He appreciated institutions\
  \ and authorities concerned over a speedy progress on the project and said it was\
  \ a public welfare project which would directly benefit the masses. The chief minister\
  \ issued instructions for setting up a steering committee to be headed by Member\
  \ Punjab Assembly Rana Sana Ullah and directed that the committee should submit\
  \ recommendations within seven days after reviewing matters pertaining to the launching\
  \ of the project of computerisation of urban land record, restriction on consolidation,\
  \ setting up of an authority with regard to permanent monitoring of the Land Record\
  \ Management Information System and other matters. The chairman planning and development\
  \ gave a detailed briefing on the pace of the project. Provincial Minister for Law\
  \ Mujtaba Shuja-ur-Rehman, Assembly Members Najaf Abbas Sial, Rana Sana Ullah, Dr.\
  \ Ayesha Ghous Pasha, Mian Tariq Mehmood, Qamar-ul-Islam, chief secretary, senior\
  \ member, board of revenue, chairman planning and development and officers concerned\
  \ were also present."

  \           ISLAMABAD: Members of parliaments of Pakistan and Afghanistan met for\
  \ the 12th round of Pakistan-Afghanistan Parliamentarians\u2019 Dialogue here called\
  \ for joint efforts and steady steps for preventing terrorist attacks and reiterated\
  \ their resolve against all kinds of terrorism and extremism affecting the two countries.In\
  \ a joint statement issued at the end of the dialogue facilitated by the Pakistan\
  \ Institute of Democracy and Transparency (PILDAT) unequivocally condemned the heinous\
  \ and inhuman terrorist attack of December 16 in Peshawar. Similar dastardly terro-rist\
  \ attacks in Kabul and Paktika province were also deplored.Parliamentarians of the\
  \ two countries acknowledged and appreciated the positive momentum in bilateral\
  \ relations generated through the visit of Afghanistan\u2019s newly-elected President\
  \ Mohammad Ashraf Ghani to Pakistan, in November, this year.The parliamentarians\
  \ also appreciated the vision of building a \u201Cpeaceful neighbourhood\u201D of\
  \ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as a fundamental element of which is the vision of\
  \ a strong, comprehensive and enduring partnership between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\
  \ \u201CA strong and viable bilateral relationship between the two countries is\
  \ the only guarantee of the security and prosperity as well as of peace and development\
  \ in the region,\u201D they said. The parliamentarians as representatives of the\

  \ are now ready to, independently and along with each other, take concrete and effective\
  \ steps to counter terrorism and extremism aimed at ensuring peace and stability\
  \ in the region.Participants of the dialogue underscored the need for bilateral\
  \ cooperation, particularly cooperation among the State and security agencies in\
  \ two countries, in fight against terrorism, extremism, and for achieving and maintaining\
  \ peace and stability. In this regard, need for comprehensive and effective laws\
  \ on combating terrorism, including cyber terrorism, was underscored. Parliaments\
  \ and parliamentary committees in both countries should oversee effective implementation\
  \ of these laws. Parliamentarians stressed that trade and commerce between the two\
  \ countries must be prioritised and formalised. Both sides also supported removal\
  \ of bottlenecks and trade barriers and emphasised that facilities for transit trade\
  \ between the two neighbouring countries must be improved. They also supported the\
  \ initiatives to enhance connectivity between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including\
  \ through a motorway between Peshawar and Kabul, rail and road links between Parachinar\
  \ and Kabul, Peshawar and Jalalabad and Chaman and Spinbolduk as well as building\
  \ a trade central strategic corridor between the two countries. They also believed\
  \ that mechanisms and opportunities for public private partnerships must also be\
  \ enhanced. The MPs also favoured de-weaponisation and improved drug management\
  \ across the border. Parliamentarians stressed on putting in place a relaxed visa\
  \ regime that allows multiple entry visas of citizens of each country. Speedy visas\
  \ should be issued for citizens travelling for health-related reasons.In addition\
  \ to the need for enhancing educational scholarships for students of Afghanistan,\
  \ the two countries would greatly benefit by cooperation in education."

  \ two-day deliberations in which Islamabad will make efforts to maximise its exports\
  \ in cement, agriculture products by seeking reduction in duty and taxes to Afghanistan,\u201D\
  \ the official sources said on Wednesday.Pakistan\u2019s exports of cement to Afghanistan\
  \ are witnessing declining trend in the recent months as Kabul is importing the\
  \ commodity from Iran.There are two factors involved in the decline in cement exports\
  \ to Afghanistan, as construction-related work is decreasing and Iranian brand of\
  \ cement is penetrating in the Afghan market, the sources said.\u201CIn order to\
  \ get our due share, Pakistan will seek waiver in duty and tariff structure on exports\
  \ of cement, as currently there is 10 percent duty on our exports, an official said.The\
  \ Afghan authorities will also demand starting negotiations on the revision of Afghanistan-Pakistan\
  \ Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) within 2015, as this agreement would exhaust after\
  \ five years.In 2003, India and Afghanistan had signed PTA that resulted in boosting\
  \ trade ties between the two countries.Now, Pakistan will also make efforts to sign\
  \ PTA with Afghanistan where Kabul would seek scaling down of the duty structure\
  \ on fresh and dry fruits.Pakistan had already granted such incentive to China and\
  \ other neighbouring countries so there was no harm in granting the same facility\
  \ to Afghanistan, the official added.When contacted, Federal Commerce Secretary\
  \ Muhammad Shehzad Arbab said the Pakistani side would submit its draft PTA to the\
  \ Afghan side and would seek their comments in order to boost trade ties between\
  \ the two countries.He said Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan would hold deliberations\
  \ on signing trilateral transit agreement on January 3 in Islamabad with clear cut\
  \ timeframe to move towards signing this agreement. However, the sources said the\
  \ APTTA will cease to exist after the lapse of five years in the coming few months.\
  \ The existing APTTA agreement states it will remain in force for five years from\
  \ the date it comes into force. The APTTA illustrates this agreement will automatically\

  \ as may be agreed upon unless terminated by either contracting party.Pakistan desires\
  \ to include Tajikistan in APTTA after the lapse of this existing agreement with\
  \ effect from October 28, 2015.In the aftermath of the signing of APTTA between\
  \ Afghanistan and Pakistan in the last five years, the commercial trade (transit\
  \ and bilateral trade) and noncommercial (NATO-related trade) showed fluctuating\
  \ trends, as in the fiscal year 2009/10 the total trade was recorded at $3.332 billion\
  \ with the share of commercial trade ($2.157 billion) and noncommercial trade ($1.165\
  \ billion). In the fiscal year 2010/11, the commercial trade was recorded at $1.871\
  \ billion and noncommercial trade at $11.65 million. The commercial trade was recorded\
  \ at $1.256 billion in 2011/12 and noncommercial trade at $525 million, $1.319 billion\

text: "A capital storm\n                            A near-perfect storm is now swirling\
  \ around capital punishment in Pakistan where a seven-year old moratorium has recently\
  \ been lifted in the wake of the Peshawar tragedy. The EU is against the decision,\
  \ being an ardent supporter of abolishing capital punishment globally. In accordance\
  \ with a 2008 report, 137 countries had abolished death penalty in law or in practice\
  \ while the US, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan retained it and accounted\
  \ for 88 percent of the world\u2019s executions.In an indirect manner, some political\
  \ parties in the country are also whipping up opposition through objections to the\
  \ government\u2019s current efforts to institute military courts through an amendment\
  \ to the constitution for speedy justice. It is not difficult to see that such resistance\
  \ is not so much out of deference to human rights or any consideration for the constitution\
  \ of Pakistan, but out of fear that a combination of speedy trials and lifting of\
  \ moratorium would adversely affect their politics which so far have had a strong\
  \ streak of violence.The EU position is understandable; it saw Pakistan as a country\
  \ on the \u2018cusp\u2019 of abolishing the death penalty when former president\
  \ Asif Ali Zardari imposed a ban on executions in 2008. Recent developments have\
  \ reversed that status. The EU had invested much effort with the Zardari regime\
  \ through political arm twisting through the European Instrument for Democracy and\
  \ Human Right (EIDHR), matched by its mechanism of funding through the European\
  \ Commission. But Zardari was confused; on the one hand the government was imposing\
  \ a moratorium on capital punishment and at the same time promulgating the Prevention\
  \ of Electronic Crimes Ordinance which included \u2018cyber terrorism\u2019 in the\
  \ list of offences warranting the death penalty.In countries where the death penalty\
  \ situation is still in flux, EU has been striving for adherence to minimum international\
  \ standards \u2013 imposing capital punishment only for the most serious intentional\
  \ and violent crimes, not imposing it on anyone less than eighteen years of age,\
  \ pregnant women, new mothers, or persons with mental disorder. The standard requires\
  \ a fair trial where the defendant benefits from legal assistance and has recourse\
  \ to an appeal process. Also every endeavour is made that there is minimum possible\
  \ suffering while carrying out the punishment. But it has taken centuries for Europe\u2019\
  s civilisation to arrive at a stage where as a society it considers the death sentence\
  \ to be cruel, inhuman and irreversible and would like to abolish it for the sake\
  \ of human dignity and progressive development of human rights. Also historically\
  \ Europe has used a whole range of very painful methods to inflict death on convicted\
  \ prisoners which are too gory to be narrated here.It is audacious to think how\
  \ a punishment that snuffs out life out of an otherwise perfectly healthy body,\
  \ can be termed as causing less suffering than another, but certainly there is a\
  \ difference between hangings as per Pakistan\u2019s jail manuals which bring life\
  \ to a sudden end as opposed to some of the seemingly sophisticated methods in the\
  \ west. Earlier this year, Dennis McGuire, who was administered a lethal injection\
  \ in an Ohio jail writhed in acute and miserable pain for nearly fifteen minutes\
  \ before breathing his last.It is also interesting to note that in the past, most\
  \ of the offences for which the death sentence was awarded in Europe, were minor\
  \ compared to today\u2019s standards. It is only through a process of evolution\
  \ that the public mind in Europe accepts interning a mass killer like the Norwegian\
  \ Anders Breivik on an island for 21 years as punishment for killing 77 innocent\
  \ lives in 2011 \u2013 the highest in Norway for such offences \u2013 just over\
  \ three months for every person killed. Indeed life couldn\u2019t come have cheaper\
  \ in a society where it is otherwise so valued. Pakistan is relatively a nascent\
  \ state on the timeline of global civilisation. It inherited English jurisprudence\
  \ tailored to serve the purposes of erstwhile colonial masters when it came into\
  \ existence. Under the best of circumstances, we are never a very stable society\
  \ and governments of every hue have been found struggling to keep the crime rate\
  \ to a manageable level. Historically, the death sentence has never reduced the\
  \ crime rate to zero but it has helped lower it. Towards that end, capital punishment\
  \ in Pakistan had an element of fear for would-be offenders and acts as deterrence.\
  \ Over time, as societal turbulence increased, the number of offences punishable\
  \ by death has also risen but in spite of the heinous nature of the crime in some\
  \ cases, Pakistan has never violated the minimum international standards. Successive\
  \ governments, except for a brief period during General Ziaul Haq\u2019s rule, have\
  \ also kept capital punishments out of public view despite public pressure as is\
  \ being witnessed these days.The social fabric of today\u2019s Pakistan has been\
  \ ripped apart by a process started decades ago by former President Ronald Reagan\
  \ when he chose to fight the \u2018evil empire\u2019 in Afghanistan by dusting off\
  \ the concept of armed Islamic jihad and employing it as a weapon in the game between\
  \ superpowers. Terrorism refuses to die as was witnessed in Peshawar recently. That\
  \ element of fear which was meant for would-be offenders through the death penalty\
  \ has struck deep into the hearts of our mothers, sisters and children and has made\
  \ normal life impossible. This fear has to be taken out of our people and put back\
  \ into the hearts of those who perpetuate such heinous crimes. The citizens of Pakistan\
  \ deserve some peace of mind and if it is through capital punishments, let it be\
  \ so. A guiding principle for capital punishment enunciated by Prophet Muhammad\
  \ (pbuh) mentions only three offences \u2013 murder, illegal sexual intercourse\
  \ committed by a married person and apostasy. Pakistan\u2019s penal code, however,\
  \ prescribes death sentence for 27 different crimes which can perhaps be reviewed\
  \ downward in deference to global sentiments on the issue especially where crime\
  \ has been checked effectively. But any outright move to abolish capital punishment\
  \ will not only aggravate the law and order situation but also be a breach of the\
  \ country\u2019s constitution which declares that no law shall be enacted against\
  \ Islamic injunctions as stipulated in the Quran and Sunnah.The former chief justice\
  \ was recently asked why the conviction rate in the anti-terrorist courts was so\
  \ low to which he responded by admitting that when evidence falls short, the courts\
  \ have no option but to let the accused go free. This is a perfectly legal approach\
  \ but the question honourable judges should be asking themselves is whether doing\
  \ so always serves the ends of justice. Would justice be better served if in an\
  \ odd case of huge public interest, and where the judge is convinced beyond any\
  \ shadow of doubt that evidence has been intentionally left patchy during investigation\
  \ under pressure from the powerful, the judgements are in response to public expectations\
  \ and not a computerised outcome of the arguments in the courts?That said, the real\
  \ issue we should be looking at is that, as far as possible, no innocent should\
  \ be deprived of his life due to miscarriage of justice. Our existing legal system\
  \ is highly flawed where self-confessed criminals of major crimes roam about freely\
  \ and the innocent get punished. The EU would therefore do well to channel its EIDHR\
  \ support, complemented by European Commission funding, towards bringing about much-needed\
  \ jurisprudence infrastructure reforms in Pakistan rather than focusing on the moratorium\
  \ on the death penalty.The writer is a retired vice admiral. Email: [email\_protected]"

  \ of public sector enterprises and statutory bodies which are running without regular\
  \ chiefs since the PML-N came to power, and has sent the report to Establishment\
  \ Division, according to Khawaja Zaheer Ahmed, special assistant to the prime minister.\
  \ After the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict of abolishing the commission constituted\
  \ for the appointment of heads of PSE, the government gave free hand to these institutions\
  \ for choosing a panel of suitable candidates for heading these institutions. The\
  \ apex court had set the deadline of December 31 for finalising the process and\
  \ submitting a report in this regard.Khawaja Zaheer Ahmed, head of the committee\
  \ constituted by the government for the appointment of heads of public sector enterprises,\
  \ while talking to The News said that the committee has completed the assigned task.\
  \ \u201CThe committee finalised its task today (Wednesday) and sent the report to\
  \ Establishment Division which would further proceed as per the court\u2019s verdict.\
  \ Out of 53 remaining PSEs only four companies i.e. Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Oil\
  \ and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL)\
  \ and Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) have asked for reviewing their panel\
  \ of candidates and sought some time which the committee granted,\u201D said Khawaja\
  \ Zaheer.The committee comprised former secretary law Barrister Zafrullah Khan,\
  \ Muhammad Zubair, secretary Establishment Division, secretary Cabinet Division\
  \ and the secretary of the relevant ministry.\u201CAfter reviewing the commission\u2019\
  s work and sensitivity of the matter, the committee in its initial report to the\
  \ government recommended that all the state-run enterprises which are being run\
  \ without a regular head should be given free hand to choose a suitable panel of\
  \ candidates to head them. We have told them to bring the panel of names to the\
  \ committee and then the committee would decide about the finalists and recommend\
  \ his name to the prime minister,\u201D he said.He said there is a minor change\
  \ in the process of appointment of heads of the state-run enterprises as earlier\
  \ the ministry used to send three names to the prime minister. However now the departments\
  \ concerned and ministries would bring these names to the committee and committee\
  \ would review them after which it would present its recommendations to the prime\
  \ minister.When asked about the reason for delay in the appointment process as the\
  \ government could appoint only five heads of the institutions so far, he said the\
  \ commission delayed the process as it failed to fulfill its task.\u201CThe commission\
  \ was fully authorised and was given a free hand but it failed as it could not hold\
  \ its meetings regularly. Due to the failure of the commission, the government has\
  \ to face criticism,\u201D he remarked.  He said the committee has made it clear\
  \ to all these institutions that they could re-advertise the positions if they want\
  \ to include eligible candidates in the list. However the final decision would be\
  \ taken by the committee after scrutinising the list of candidates.Five of 58 state-run\
  \ enterprises and statutory bodies got their chiefs already, whereas the process\
  \ of 15 organisations is under process, three departments have been dissolved or\

text: "Ghani to keep a close eye on water board, SBCA, KDA, KMC\nKARACHI: Sindh\u2019\
  s local government minister has stressed the need to make major improvements in\
  \ the Karachi Water & Sewerage Board (KWSB), the Sindh Building Control Authority\
  \ (SBCA), the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation\
  \ (KMC).Talking to The News at his office, Saeed Ghani said he has recently taken\
  \ over the LG department, so for now he would review their performances and then\
  \ make appropriate changes. He said that at present the working of these bodies\
  \ is particularly unsatisfactory.Ghani said the recommendations provided by the\
  \ Supreme Court-designated judicial commission investigating the non-provision of\
  \ potable water, proper sanitation facilities and healthy environment to Sindh\u2019\
  s people would be implemented in letter and spirit.When asked to comment on Karachi\
  \ Mayor Wasim Akhtar\u2019s demand that the KWSB, the SBCA, the KDA and the master\
  \ plan department should be under the mayor, the LG minister said that such a demand\
  \ can only be met through amendments by the Sindh Assembly in the LG law.He said\
  \ the mayor can demand all he wants, but he has to seek the help of the provincial\
  \ legislature to have them met, adding that before making any demands, the mayor\
  \ should take a look at his performance.Ghani listed the deplorable conditions of\
  \ the city\u2019s parks and hospitals as well as the roads and streets that are\
  \ strewn with garbage as Akhtar\u2019s failings. He said the KMC is unable to generate\
  \ revenue, which shows how poorly the body is performing, so before criticising\
  \ the Sindh government, one should take a look at their own performance. The mayor\
  \ is unable to stop the rampant corruption in the KMC, added the minister.Ghani\
  \ asked what Akhtar and his Muttahida Qaumi Movement had achieved as regards the\
  \ Karachi Building Control Authority and the KWSB when his then party colleague\
  \ Mustafa Kamal was the city mayor.The minister said the provincial government gives\
  \ them Rs500 million a month to disburse salaries and the chief minister has provided\
  \ them with development funds. He asked if the mayor can show any development project\
  \ or other work on which these funds have been spent.Responding to a question regarding\
  \ the mayor\u2019s renewed demand of CM Syed Murad Ali Shah to provide him with\
  \ authority and funds, Ghani said Akhtar already has all the powers under the Sindh\
  \ Local Government Ordinance 2013.The minister said the people keep complaining\
  \ to him about the deplorable conditions of roads and streets across the city where\
  \ heaps of garbage have been dumped.He said that when the KMC had failed to lift\
  \ garbage and sought the help of Bahria Town Chairman Malik Riaz, he had helped\
  \ only because of former Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari, as he had quoted in\
  \ his speech that Zardari is his close friend and had asked him to help lift garbage\
  \ from District Central.A day earlier Ghani had rejected the claim of opposition\
  \ political parties that the provincial government\u2019s figure of offal removal\
  \ was exaggerated, and reiterated that 41,980 tonnes of sacrificial animal remains\
  \ were lifted and disposed of by Karachi\u2019s municipal agencies during the three\
  \ days of Eidul Azha.Addressing a news conference at the media cell of the Pakistan\
  \ Peoples Party, he said that around a million animals were sacrificed this Eidul\
  \ Azha across the metropolis in the areas that do not fall under the jurisdiction\
  \ of the different cantonment boards.Ghani said that according to the results of\
  \ the latest population census, Karachi comprises about three million families.\
  \ \u201CSome 33 per cent of the families living in the city sacrificed animals this\
  \ time, and the number of animals whose offal we lifted corresponds to this estimate.\u201D\
  He said that those with objections over the government\u2019s figure should object\
  \ to similar statistics of other cities. He added that some 44,000 tonnes of remains\
  \ were lifted in Lahore, so it is implausible that around 66 per cent of the families\
  \ living in Pakistan\u2019s second largest city sacrificed animals.The minister\
  \ said that in Peshawar around 9,500 tonnes of remains were allegedly disposed of,\
  \ meaning that up to 97 per cent of the families living in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019\
  s capital sacrificed animals.\u201CAccording to [Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Karachi\
  \ chief] Firdous Shamim Naqvi, the city\u2019s people sacrificed fewer animals than\
  \ the offal lifted. So, instead of questioning our very plausible figure, he should\
  \ challenge the number of Peshawar.\u201DGhani advised the leaders of the opposition\
  \ Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) that instead of embroiling themselves in an undue\
  \ controversy, they should at least check with the Central District Municipal Corporation\
  \ (DMC) chairman, who is affiliated with their own party.The minister said that\
  \ according to the figure provided by the Central DMC, some 437,000 animals were\
  \ sacrificed in District Central alone. He asked MQM leader Khawaja Izharul Hassan\
  \ to inquire about it from his party\u2019s local government representatives.Ghani\
  \ thanked the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar, chairmen\
  \ of the different DMCs, the Karachi District Council, other municipal agencies\
  \ and local government employees for their respective roles in the operation to\
  \ lift and dispose of offal and other remains of sacrificial animals.He claimed\
  \ that barring a few areas, the operation had been completed. He said that there\
  \ were a few complaints regarding the clean-up operation, but the overall sanitary\
  \ situation remained promising and would be improved further."
