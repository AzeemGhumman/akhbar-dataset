text: "Oh, CPEC\n\n\u201CIn order for things to remain the same, everything must change\u201D\
  \ \u2013 Giuseppe Tomasi di LampedusaHere\u2019s the problem: the winning party,\
  \ the Election Commission and other institutions involved in last week\u2019s national\
  \ polls say there is nothing wrong in the way the results were announced, and that\
  \ the outcome of the electoral exercise is the will of the people. They say it\u2019\
  s fair play.Those affected by the unprecedented delay in poll results announcements\
  \ and almost surreal developments in vote counting and tabulation, among other things,\
  \ cry brazen foul play. They allege that the umpire\u2019s thumb and finger both\
  \ were at work in ensuring the PTI\u2019s victory (and their loss). So while Imran\
  \ Khan wants to make government at the centre and in Punjab, the broad coalition\
  \ of parties (PML-N, MMA, ANP, PPP, PSP, MQM, and the rest) wants to expand their\
  \ protest and question the very foundation on which the PTI\u2019s victory stands.Whom\
  \ do you believe? What do you believe? This is a hard one. It can tear your brain\
  \ apart. One safe way to get a perspective on things is to tell yourself that the\
  \ many odd things that have happened before and during these critical polls, and\
  \ which together have produced this outcome, have been because of CPEC. Yes, CPEC\
  \ \u2013 Crazy Process of Election-related Coincidences. You can believe for the\
  \ sake of staying sane that behind this CPEC lies some inscrutable universal force\
  \ which sequenced political, judicial and electoral events in such a way that they\
  \ all ended up giving the PTI its magnificent mandate and every other party a humbling\
  \ defeat.Reliance on CPEC as a tool of reflection and analysis is particularly helpful\
  \ if you don\u2019t like to hear words like \u2018rigging\u2019, \u2018engineering,\u2019\
  \ \u2018fixing\u2019, \u2018buying\u2019, \u2018selling\u2019 \u2013 words which\
  \ we heard endlessly for five years about 2013 elections, and are now so sick of\
  \ them that we simply don\u2019t want to mention them.So your analysis can unfold\
  \ something like the following. It was CPEC that caused the collapse of the Election\
  \ Commission\u2019s famed system for transmission of results. It somehow stopped\
  \ working just when it was needed the most \u2013 at the end of the polling time.\
  \ It just happened that a basic system like this (for data transmission) which works\
  \ fine in every nook and cranny of the world, processing hits in millions for tiny\
  \ companies without fail, could not take the load of a few thousand hits here in\
  \ Pakistan on the 25th of July.From this crazy coincidence flowed every other crazy\
  \ coincidence: delay in the results announcement, banishing of polling agents of\
  \ the losing parties from polling stations during the counting of the votes, disappearance\
  \ of the counted vote aggregate (Form 45) that has to be signed by each contestant\u2019\
  s polling agent, and the inability of most presiding officers to reach the offices\
  \ of the Returning Officers \u2013 located four kilometres away \u2013 in some cases,\
  \ even in 48 hours.It was CPEC that created results in which the maximum rejected\
  \ vote, which in at least 35 cases could have altered the outcome, belonged to the\
  \ losing candidates. It was CPEC that ensured that somehow voters had to wait the\
  \ longest in constituencies where a healthier vote cast would have potentially led\
  \ to the victory of the N-League.It was CPEC that produced this amazing statistic\
  \ of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan causing the loss of 14 National Assembly seats to\
  \ only one party: the PML-N. It was CPEC\u2019s doing that every party that could\
  \ have potentially joined forces with the N-League to form government at the centre\
  \ is wiped out \u2013 the MMA, the ANP and the MQM-P for instance. It was CPEC\u2019\
  s fault that the chief election commissioner, the secretary of the ECP and all the\
  \ resources at their command had no clue about securing ballot boxes\u2019 record\
  \ and that the security forces had to remain in custody of or stand at guard on\
  \ the boxes during recounting even when their special duties had ended.The impact\
  \ of this Crazy Process of Election-related Coincidences was visible before the\
  \ elections as well. From NAB getting hold of the likes of Eng Qamrul Islam contesting\
  \ from Pindi on the N ticket to the seven-year old case being adjusted before the\
  \ polls and resulting in the arrest and incarceration of another N-Leaguer from\
  \ the same city, Hanif Abbasi. It was just a coincidence that somehow all media\
  \ outlets found it convenient to start talking about the PTI\u2019s victory two\
  \ hours after the election time closed even though a mere three percent of results\
  \ had been announced and full results could only be obtained after three days.CPEC\
  \ also necessitated that all media outlets somehow agreed to blackout most news\
  \ of vast and very nasty public protests in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over alleged\
  \ rigging. It was just a coincidence that these outlets made sure, almost in unison,\
  \ to mute or take off press conferences of parties levelling serious allegations\
  \ about the polling and itsresults.It had to be CPEC, what else, that ensured that\
  \ Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz never get to show their faces \u2013 even in court\
  \ \u2013 to the public 15 days prior to the election and ten days after. Thanks\
  \ to CPEC, every court case involving the Punjab government of the previous era\
  \ became a media trial of politicians who were most vocal during their days as ministers.CPEC\
  \ created the Grand Democratic Alliance. It was CPEC that pricked the conscience\
  \ of south of Punjab landlords and religious families to switch sides at the eleventh\
  \ hour; the birth of the Balochistan Awami Party was also a random coincidence.\
  \ So is the amazing fact of the volume of stories about Asif Ali Zardari and his\
  \ sister\u2019s cases of money laundering and other alleged crimes corresponding\
  \ to their political stance on whether to join forces with the PTI\u2019s opponents\
  \ or stay quiet.Of course, it is just a crazy coincidence that everything that Shaikh\
  \ Rashid said (from the chief justice visiting the sight of the hospital that Rashid\
  \ wanted to complete in his constituency to the Sharif family landing specifically\
  \ in Adiala Jail) and Javed Hashmi repeatedly predicted has come true!You have to\
  \ believe in CPEC and nothing else to make sense of the events that have taken place\
  \ on this country\u2019s electoral chessboard recently and those that have preceded\
  \ them. Nobody is to be blamed. No one did anything. Not even lifted a finger or\
  \ made a call, or rolled out maps to create an elaborate plan to recast national\
  \ politics. These things do not happen like this. Maybe elsewhere in the uncivilised\
  \ world, but not here in Pakistan. No way. Nobody has anything to do with anything.\
  \ All election-related things have happened because they just happened.But let\u2019\
  s be clear on one thing: just because big things have simply happened on their own\
  \ does not mean that they will not have consequences. CPEC\u2019s consequences are\
  \ far and wide. The election results have triggered a wave of anger and a deep feeling\
  \ of being wronged in a large section of a charged electorate that cuts across at\
  \ least four ethnic and linguistic boundaries \u2013 Baloch, Pakhtun, Mohajir and\
  \ Punjabi. CPEC has activated religious groups with viciously sectarian or parochial\
  \ worldviews and with matchless ability to agitate the street.CPEC has broken down\
  \ political debate into two unbridgeable halves and has planted seeds of terrifying\
  \ distrust and enveloping hatred among the young and the old voter alike. It has\
  \ laid a siege on the plan to build a stable political order by putting a big question\
  \ mark on the legitimacy of the verdict of these critical elections.These are long-term\
  \ consequences that have already started to unfold. Only if this Crazy Process of\
  \ Election-related Coincidences had not happened, Imran Khan\u2019s victory would\
  \ have been such a splendid thing for the country \u2013 neat, clean, undiluted\
  \ and unquestioned. He could have truly led the country from the front.But now he\
  \ has to constantly look over his shoulder, cover his sides and, what\u2019s worse,\
  \ constantly depend on CPEC to keep him afloat. He is a man holding a tainted trophy\
  \ even though without CPEC this trophy could well have been his, fair and square.\
  \ But now we would never know that. All we know is that the Crazy Process of Election-related\
  \ Coincidences has created a royal mess \u2013 of the sort that will not get sorted\
  \ out easily. Wait and watch.The writer is former executive editor of The News and\
