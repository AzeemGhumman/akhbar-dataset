text: '  Monitoring Desk KABUL: An estimated 160,000 to 200,000 children under one
  year of age in Afghanistan   one in three   received zero vaccinations last year,
  the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) said in a statement on Wednesday. These gaps
  in routine immunization coverage not only put the lives of under-vaccinated children
  at risk but also everyone around them. Insecurity in parts of the country reduces
  access for health workers to reach children and for families to get to health clinics,
  while displaced populations and those living in remote areas are also more likely
  to miss out on vaccines.  Immunization is the right of every child, we must accelerate
  our efforts to ensure all children in the country are vaccinated and protected from
  preventable diseases,  said H.E. Minister for Public Health, Dr Ferozuddin Feroz.  Through
  immunization we can protect children from diseases, such as measles, polio and pneumonia   a
  major killer of children under 5 years of age,  Dr, Feroz added. The remarks come
  as Afghanistan marks,  World Immunization Week , which is celebrated annually, 24-30
  April, to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination and ensure that people
  take action to receive all required life-saving vaccines. The theme for 2018 is:  Protected
  Together, #VaccinesWork . Efforts to eradicate polio also continue in Afghanistan
  and most of the country remains polio-free. In 2018, there have been 7 polio cases,
  mostly restricted to high-risk areas in the southern and eastern regions.  We are
  seeing improvements in routine immunization coverage and new vaccines have been
  introduced,  said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative in Afghanistan.  But
  the country is still behind schedule on the targets for disease eradication and
  elimination, including polio, measles, rubella, and maternal and neonatal tetanus.
  We must make more concerted efforts to reach all Global Vaccine Action Plan goals
  by 2020,  Dr. Peeperkorn added. The Global Vaccine Action Plan was endorsed by the
  World Health Assembly in 2012 and is a commitment to ensure that no one misses out
  on vital immunization by 2020.  We must all commit to providing every child with
  the lifesaving vaccines they need,  said Stefano Savi, UNICEF s deputy representative
  in Afghanistan.  This includes reaching the most vulnerable children, who are often
  affected by conflict or living in the most remote areas of the country. Children
  in Afghanistan have the right to get the best start in life, to develop and progress
  like any child,  Savi added. Immunization saves millions of lives globally each
  year and is widely recognized as one of the world s most successful and cost-effective
  health interventions. Key facts and progress: The number of health centres providing
  immunization services increased by 12 per cent to 1,767 facilities around the country.
  In 2017, some 1,250,000 children, under one year old, were vaccinated in against
  measles, polio, whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria, pneumonia, meningitis and tuberculosis.
  In 2017, 900,000 pregnant women and children younger than 5 were provided with medicines
  for antenatal care, newborn care, pneumonia, diarrhoea and meningitis. 10 antigens
  are currently included in Afghanistan s routine immunization programme, available
  free of charge. In recent years, Afghanistan has introduced new vaccines, including
  the Pentavalent vaccine protecting people from five deadly diseases and the Pneumococcal
  vaccine to fight pneumonia. This year, the Ministry of Public Health introduced
  the Rota vaccine, it s hoped that this will significantly reduce mortality due to
  diarrhea in the country, From July to September 2018, a nationwide measles immunization
  campaign will target 14 million children, aged 10 months to five years.     Related '

  criticised Sunday the frequent strikes by the legal fraternity, and shared that

  \ techniques and mental strength.But for anyone arguing that his performance was\
  \ just a one off spectacular, needs to revisit his battle-hardened attitude in whatever\
  \ little chances that came his way. At the 2012 Asia Cup final in Mirpur, he top\

  \ decent run and the Braveheart responded by maturing into a genuine match-winner.\
  \ He is the first Pakistani wicketkeeper to score three hundreds in one year.But\
  \ let\u2019s not forget that he is first a keeper and then anything else. In an\
  \ era when Pakistan Cricket has been hostage to the slips and misses of the Umar\
  \ Akmal Trilogy, its Sarfaraz\u2019s dependable glove work that has proved to be\
  \ a safe haven for Pakistani bowlers.Had he not been replaced, just imagine the\
  \ mess Akmal would have made off Hashim Amla\u2019s nudge.Like countless sad stories\
  \ of dumping and nepotism in Pakistan Cricket, Sarfaraz is no stranger to hardships\
  \ and baseless criticism. Often sidelined for unexplained reasons, the street fighter\
  \ has the habit of crawling his way back through some stellar performances.Some\
  \ circles scared of his skills and leadership qualities have discouraged and deliberately\
  \ tried to keep him out of the team. During a recent tour, his visa was purposely\
  \ delayed and a fellow keeper kept on telling him that he will be replacing Sarfaraz\
  \ on the tour. Sarfaraz eventually went on the tour, though he was dropped soon\
  \ afterwards without given right opportunities.Right after the 2012 Asia Cup, he\
  \ was dubbed as \u201CNot a good enough batsman\u201D and was dropped from the next\
  \ outing.A further shock came with him not being awarded the Central Contract.Expecting\
  \ Better from a CoachLet\u2019s admit it, Sarfaraz proved the Think Tank completely\
  \ wrong. In another setting, the Coach or captain would have erupted with joy and\
  \ shower laurels on his young gun, but remember this is Team Pakistan, where personal\
  \ egos have always been much larger than the game.There was no point in Waqar walking\
  \ alone for the press conference; honestly, he hadn\u2019t done much to deserve\
  \ a chat with the media about this feat (he puts Misbah to the cannons whenever\
  \ the team loses). His only right move was to let Sarfaraz play, but only after\
  \ facing ruthless criticism and shouldering some scratchy performances from his\

  \ to pose a winning smile for the cameras. It was his feelings and experience that\
  \ were of interest to fans and media scribes around the world. Sadly, he was deprived\
  \ of the opportunity and Waqar engineered an unnecessary controversy.Interestingly,\
  \ Waqar has time and again accused Wasim Akram of sabotaging his carrier. It\u2019\
  s strange to see him handing the same treatment to the young and controversy free\
  \ Sarfaraz. Waqar needs to realise that like a boomerang thrown correctly, a deserving\
  \ player will only bring back the laurels to him.Hopefully, things will change for\
  \ Sarfaraz now.He has shown his toughness and lethality and expectations would be\
  \ high from him, but as the saying goes, \u201CWhen the going gets tough, the tough\
  \ get going\u201D. The fear of failure and being dropped again would keep pushing\

  to delay or stop the sixth census in Pakistan, as mentioned in Aam log Ittehad Petition
  filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. According to Petitioner Justice (retd) Wajihuddin
  Ahmed, Acting Chairman Aam Loeg Ittehad:  While the first four censuses were more
  or less regularly and duly held in the years 1951, 1961, 1972 and 1981, the fifth
  census was undertaken in 1998 after 17 years, an inordinate delay of 7 years which
  was certainly avoidable. That is not to say that the pervious censuses were problem
  free.  However, we are now in the 21st century and living in the Information Age,
  with little or no scope for such aberrations.  Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed said in
  a separate statement:  None of the governments are serious in the matter, though
  for different reasons. The Federal Government is engaged in a mechanical exercise,
  solely because it has to honor its undertaking before the apex court. The sardars
  and Khans of Balochistan and KP feel threatened that once their impecunious and
  burgeoning populations are quantified, their own lavish and luxurious lifestyles
  would come under scrutiny. The Sindh government, which exclusively represents rural
  Sindh, is determined to inflate the numbers in rural areas and decimate those in
  urban Sindh.  Justice Wajih further said that the census is an activity necessary
  to assess the needs on the basis of population, and this act will be beneficial
  for human rights. The petition points out that the leadership of Punjab is no wiser.
  It is fully aware that the proportion of their population is slowly declining and
  if census is held it would no longer be officially reflected as being 55.63% of
  the population of Pakistan. The estimated Punjab population, as per the 2011 Housing
  Census, is 47.69%. In the previous census of 1998, while a slower per annum growth
  rate of 2.64% in Punjab was recorded, Sindh registered a growth rate of 2.80% per
  annum. The petition further states that if this trend continues, it is bound to
  have a negative impact on the 148 National Assembly seats allocated to the province
  of Punjab under the Constitution. In order to maintain and ensure the numerical
  majority of the province of Punjab in the population census of Pakistan, some functionaries
  of the Punjab government are keen to have the exercise of the forthcoming census
  abandoned. The notables of Punjab need to realise that if the present population
  ratio of their province is unrealistically maintained and reflected to be higher
  than it actually is, history may repeat itself. In similar circumstances, the former
  province of East Pakistan, having a 54% share of the total population, seceded,
  not the least for the reason that the former province of West Pakistan was not in
  favour of the idea of remaining a permanent minority province, says the petition.
  The petition notes that the situation is particularly sensitive in Sindh because
  at this eleventh hour the government is proactively pursuing the issuance of CNICs
  in rural areas. It is no secret that the government of Sindh only and exclusively
  represents rural Sindh, with a predictable tilt in that direction. Its unchecked
  participation in the census exercise, which, as stated in the preceding paragraph,
  is a Federal subject/entry, occurring in Part II of the Federal Legislative List,
  controlled by Articles 153(4) and 154 (1) (6) ), is likely to produce unacceptable
  results. Aam Loeg Ittehad petition states that there is hue and cry in Balochistan
  that if the current census, in the present situation, is carried out the Baloch
  people shall be relegated to being a minority in their own province. Nothing can
  be farther from the truth. The Baloch people, who are purported to have moved to
  Sindh and Punjab, can easily be counted at their present places of residence.  And
  if some Afghan refugees, in Balochistan, now possess Pakistan CNICs, they can always
  be carefully screened and excluded from the head count of the forthcoming population
  census. Thereafter, their illegal Pakistan CNICs can be replaced by other distinctive
  cards of identification. Much the same is the position in KP, where provincial leaders
  have shown apprehension that if some migrants from Afghanistan, who are unlawfully
  holding Pakistan CNICs, are counted, as part of the population, the Pashtuns would
  be converted into a minority. That also is as illogical a position as taken by the
  Baloch sardars. For one thing, an inflated KP population would bring similar benefits,
  as in the case of Balochistan and in any case the electoral process would remain
  unaffected, as in the case of Balochistan, states the petition. It has been requested
  of the Honorable Court to direct the Federal Government to assume full jurisdiction
  in the matter of the forthcoming census and provide directions and guidance to the
  Council of Common Interests, as and when necessary. The Court has also been appealed
  to direct the Federal and Provincial Governments of Pakistan to ensure full, complete
  and absolute compliance of law and the Constitution in the matter of the forthcoming
  census. Census is not just for the head-count of Pakistani citizens (CNIC holders)
  but of all persons in Pakistan who must be counted on the basis of due and verifiable
  particulars and only after securing due clarification of valid CNIC holders. The
  petition has further requested the Court to issue directions to NADRA, through the
  Chair NADRA to cancel all illegal CNICs and, where needed, to issue other cards/insignias
  for identification of persons holding illegal CNICs. And also to prohibit NADRA
  from issuing new CNICs at least one month prior to the start of the first phase
  of the census. It has also been requested that the Court prohibit all Provincial
  Governments from any and all direct or indirect interaction with the census functionaries,
  and to ensure that no census result is announced until the Armed Forces  component
  of the census personnel expressly approves it. '

  so far this year, according to figures collected by AFP as India counts the rising
  toll from floods that have devastated southern Kerala state.  The monsoon, which
  lasts from June to September, causes widespread death and destruction across South
  Asia each year, with the tourist hotspot of Kerala suffering its worst floods in
  nearly 100 years. Kerala has reported 445 deaths with more bodies discovered each
  day as a massive cleanup gets underway. The floods forced more than a million people
  to seek shelter in temporary relief camps and 15 others were reported missing up
  to Monday.  Kerala accounted for nearly half of the more than 1,000 deaths reported
  across India, with over 160 killed in neighbouring Karnataka state, more than 200
  fatalities in Uttar Pradesh state, and 195 in West Bengal, according to official
  figures. The monsoon also battered Nepal, with 87 people killed since June, according
  to the home ministry, including a woman and eight children swept away by a landslide
  in a remote village. But in Sri Lanka, where authorities organised the early evacuation
  of 750,000 people in threatened areas this year, the death toll from monsoon floods
  fell to 24 from 224 killed in May and June last year, official figures showed. In
  Bangladesh, floods and landslides killed at least 29 people, according to official
  figures. In the deadliest monsoon-induced disaster in recent years in South Asia,
  flooding and landslides killed around 5,800 people in India s northern Uttarakhand

language: en

summary: null

text: 'Many European Union member states have failed the migrant victims of torture
  and trauma by not having systems in place to recognise the ordeals they have suffered,
  and support them on arrival. Such trauma if left untreated can scar them and their
  families for life, and may lead to suicide. These are some of the findings from
  the latest summary report of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) on migration-related
  fundamental rights concerns in select EU member states. It examines how victims
  are being handled by national authorities to highlight how to best offer them the
  protection they are entitled to. Many migrants and asylum seekers have fled or experienced
  extreme suffering in their home countries or en route to Europe. This includes physical
  and psychological violence, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. Lengthy bureaucracy,
  uncertainty about the outcome of asylum proceedings and poor reception conditions
  can compound their suffering. In Denmark alone, there were 120 suicide attempts
  and incidents of suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in 2016, of which 29 were
  by children. Despite international and EU laws guarding against such treatment offering
  support to victims, many member states are falling short of their duties, the report
  shows. Some of the report s main findings include:  1. The true extent of suffering
  is hard to gauge as only limited data on the victims of torture and trauma and on
  suicide attempts is collected in the 13 member states studied. Only Greece regularly
  collects information on torture victims.  2.  Recurrent violence or the excessive
  use of force by state officials or those working on their behalf was not found although
  there were cases of individual and localised incidents. However, serious incidents
  are more frequent along EU external border zones.  3.  Identifying victims is problematic
  given the lack of formal screening procedures. Instead countries heavily rely on
  the expertise and knowledge of individual staff, although tools are increasingly
  being developed to facilitate identification by non-experts.   4.  Access to support
  is limited by the number of specialised medical staff who can provide psychological
  or psychiatric help. The lack of staff often leads to long waiting periods; for
  example, in Germany around 5,600 asylum seekers waited over a year to receive treatment.
  It is also a challenge starting therapy when asylum applicants are homeless or live
  in reception facilities that are not adequate to sustain the therapy.   5.  Despite
  training, monitoring bodies and complaints mechanisms in all member states, their
  effectiveness in preventing ill-treatment varies from country to country. Despite
  the lack of attention to torture and trauma victims, the report also identifies
  promising practices that other member states could adopt to identify and support
  victims. The European Commission asked the Agency for Fundamental Rights to collect
  data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in member states,
  particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 member
  states: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy,
  the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. '

  \ gladly offer him the opening slot, handing him the keeper\u2019s gloves needs\
  \ a lion\u2019s heart. He has been missing from ODI action since June 2013 but that\
  \ would be of little concern as he carries bundles of experience tasting Australian\
  \ pitches and modern pacers. Initially part of Pakistan\u2019s 30 member Squad,\
  \ Karman lost his place and popularity to the young and fearless Sarfaraz.3-Kevin\
  \ PietersenProbably the most dominating and explosive cricketer of the modern era,\
  \ the past year has been tough for the fire-eating stroke maker. A poor avg of 29.40\
  \ during the Ashes down under made the selector\u2019s job easy. For a high maintenance\
  \ player like him, even a few low scores are enough to raise questions. Last wearing\
  \ the England shirt in September 2013, KP has been creating havoc in cricket leagues\
  \ around the world and specially the Big Bash.4-Yuvraj SinghThe True \u201CRock-Star\u201D\
  \ of International cricket and a heartthrob to millions, 2015 Would Cup will surely\
  \ miss the beloved Yuvi. The Hero of the previous edition failed to appear in any\
  \ ODI in 2014 and had an average stint in IPL. The lowest point came when Yuvi failed\
  \ to cut into initial 30. Regardless of this rusty performance, Yuvi is one player\
  \ who\u2019s spark shines at the highest level, a ticking bomb that can go off exactly\
  \ when needed. Dhoni\u2019s 11 would definitely miss a match winner in their ranks.5-Fawad\
  \ AlamFawad Alam is undoubted Pakistan\u2019s hidden gem and at the same time, their\
  \ Unsolved puzzle. Forced into oblivion for a good 3 years, Fawad burst into match\
  \ winning performances when given a chance at the Asia Cup. His sparkling come back\
  \ was a huge surprise, big enough only to be matched by his omission from the world\
  \ cup. Milking 345 runs from 8 matches at a healthy avg of 43, Fawad suddenly became\
  \ the darling of the nation. His Vadera looking mustache and sticking-in approach\
  \ fetched back the much needed stability in the waggling middle order. In a batting\
  \ line up that\u2019s always ready to choke, one can only hope that Pakistan made\
  \ the right decision by leaving out their Iron-Wall.6-Dwayne BravoA maverick all\
  \ rounder, Bravo is missing the world cup seat for reasons purely beyond the boundary.\
  \ West Indian players have had a long prevailing payment dispute with their board\
  \ and Bravo; along with Kevin Pollard were the latest to feel the heat. Bravo faced\
  \ the music for leading the revolt and was replaced by former skipper Darren Sammy.7-Ryan\
  \ HarrisHave Australia made a blunder by not picking the blue chip Harris? Only\
  \ time will tell. Nicknamed Rhino for his hulking figure and tear-apart approach,\
  \ Harris makes a formidable opening bowling pair with Mitchell Johnson, one many\
  \ openers would least like to face. Despite some impressive performance, Australian\
  \ selectors\u2019 weren\u2019t convinced that the 35 year olds injury prone body\
  \ would survive the toil of the World Cup. They appeared more interested in handing\
  \ him the ball for the upcoming Ashes.8-James NeeshamNew Zealand stirred a storm\
  \ by dropping James Neesham and picking the long forgotten Gant Elliot. The magnitude\
  \ of this jolt could only be matched with Pakistan\u2019s dragging of Sohail Khan\
  \ from international oblivion. The debate against Nasham raised the fact that his\
  \ best performances came in test matches and his replacement Elliot would bring\
  \ solidity to the batting line.9-Ajantha MendisThe maestro that gave us the mystery\
  \ \u201CCarrom Ball\u201D and is remembered best for tormenting the Indian Team.\
  \ He might not be as effective as the time he emerged, but still remains a lethal\
  \ force in the shorter formats where batsmen don\u2019t have much time to adjust\
  \ to his variations. He is one of the 6 players overlooked by the Islanders for\
  \ the Cup. This cut could eventually mean an end to his illustrious but often up\
  \ and down career.10-Saeed AjmalThe story of Ajmal is the saddest of the Cup. Had\
  \ it not been for the suspected arm action, Ajmal would have been the Hercules for\
  \ Pakistan. Baffled with fitness issues, Ajmal\u2019s emission could stretch the\
  \ cup further away from the Green Shirts. Always a lethal force to reckon with,\
  \ Ajmal has been re-structuring his action ever since English umpire Ian Gould brought\
  \ his action under the microscope.11-Umer GulGul, undoubtedly Pakistan\u2019s most\
  \ experience bowler has been battling with a long aggravating knee injury. Operated\
  \ in May, Gul was recalled for the series against Sri-Lanka where the pain resurfaced\
  \ and turned chronic during the New Zealand series. Gul has maintained that he is\
  \ fit for the highest level, but somehow failed to satisfy the selectors. The architect\
  \ of the 2009 T-20 triumph and countless memorable moments, the world\u2019s best\
  \ dearth bowler will surely be missed.Robin Peterson \u2013 12th Man. It would be\

heading: Four questions on Iran's legal challenge to US sanctions
language: en
publisher: Geo News
summary: null
tags:
- world
text: 'Iran s legal challenge against renewed sanctions by the United States goes
  before the UN s International Court of Justice on Monday.  Here are four key questions
  regarding the case: What is the case about? Iran s attempt to block the reinstatement
  of sanctions, announced by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, is the latest
  in a series of court battles that Tehran and Washington are fighting at the ICJ.  Trump
  announced on May 8 that he was pulling out of a landmark deal between Iran and major
  powers aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The deal agreed
  with the UN s five permanent Security Council members and Germany in 2015 limits
  Tehran s stockpile of enriched uranium until 2031 in exchange for sanctions relief.
  Blasting the accord as a "horrible, one-sided deal", Trump reimposed a wave of tough,
  unilateral sanctions. Tehran now accuses Washington of "besieging" its economy and
  wants the Hague-based court   which rules in disputes between countries   to order
  the US to temporarily halt punitive measures, while the judges mull the deeper merits
  of the case. Does Tehran have a case? The case has two elements, said Eric De Brabandere,
  professor of international dispute settlement at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
  Firstly, "Iran genuinely considers the re-imposition of sanctions a violation of
  international law." Secondly, "Iran has the support of many European states on the
  question of sanctions, politically speaking," De Brabandere argued. Iran s representatives
  need to convince the ICJ that its 15 permanent judges indeed have the jurisdiction
  to hear the case. Tehran bases its arguments on a little-known 1955 treaty between
  Iran and the United States. The treaty provides for "friendly relations" between
  the two countries, encourages mutual trade and investment and regulates consular
  relations. However, there have been no formal diplomatic ties between Tehran and
  Washington since the regime of the US-backed Shah was deposed by Iran''s revolution
  in 1979. What will Washington argue? "My guess is that for this case they will argue
  that the court has no jurisdiction, as they did in a separate case launched against
  the US two years ago," said De Brabandere. Washington could invoke two arguments.
  One is that the 1955 treaty is no longer in force, because it is a "treaty of friendship"
  between two nations which have been adversaries for the last four decades. Secondly,
  US representatives could say that the dispute was "not about the treaty, but about
  sanctions and Iran s alleged terrorist activities," De Brabandere said. "The US
  is likely to argue that the dispute is about something much broader than a treaty,"
  for instance Tehran s nuclear ambitions, the expert said. Furthermore, there is
  a clause in the 1955 treaty which allows the states to take "any measures to protect
  essential security interests." Can Iran s case succeed? "I think it s very likely
  that the ICJ will, based on the 1955 treaty, decide to hear the case," said De Brabandere.
  However, whether the case will be successful on its own merits -- in other words
  whether the United States indeed breached its obligations -- is more difficult to
  establish. "For one, the 1955 treaty is relatively narrow in scope. It means that
  the ICJ can only rule whether the US violated its obligations under the specific
  treaty," De Brabandere said. This means that the ICJ s judges will not rule in what
  they may consider any broader dispute between Iran and the United States. The outcome
  of the case   which could still take years before being handed down   "is very difficult
  to predict," said De Brabandere. '

text: 'THE HAGUE: Iran will argue Monday against renewed sanctions imposed by the
  United States, as a bitter legal battle between Tehran and Washington opens before
  the UN s top court. US President Donald Trump reimposed a wave of tough unilateral
  sanctions on Iran three weeks ago, bringing back into effect harsh penalties that
  had been lifted under a landmark 2015 agreement. A second round of measures is to
  come into effect in early November, targeting Iran s valuable oil and energy sector.
  Tehran filed its case before the International Court of Justice in late July, calling
  on the Hague-based tribunal s judges to order the immediate lifting of sanctions,
  which it said would cause "irreparable prejudice." The US had no right to reinstate
  such measures, Tehran added, as it demanded compensation for damages. Iran maintained
  restoring the penalties lifted under the historic 2015 deal, aimed at curbing Tehran
  s nuclear ambitions, violated a decades-old treaty signed between the two nations
  in 1955. The ICJ -- set up in 1946 to rule in disputes between countries -- is expected
  to take a couple of months to decide whether to grant Tehran s request for a provisional
  ruling, while a final decision in the case may actually still take years. Trump
  described the 2015 deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the United
  Nations Security Council, as well as Germany, as a "horrible one-sided deal (that)
  failed to achieve the fundamental objective of blocking all paths to a Iranian nuclear
  bomb." Even though all of the other parties pleaded with him not to abandon the
  pact, Trump pulled out and announced he would reinstate sanctions.  Neither war,
  nor negotiations  Tehran -- which argues that the move violates the little-known
  1955 Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations -- says that the new sanctions are already
  hurting its economy. Iran s currency the rial has lost around half its value since
  April. A raft of international companies -- including France s Total, Peugeot and
  Renault, and Germany s Siemens and Daimler -- have suspended operations in Iran
  in the wake of the move. Both Air France and British Airways announced Thursday
  they were halt flights to Tehran next month, saying they were not commercially viable,
  but the British carrier added the decision was unrelated to the new tranche of sanctions.
  In his executive order, Trump argued that the sanctions would turn up the financial
  pressure on Tehran to come to a "comprehensive and lasting solution" regarding activities
  that the international community regarded as "malign" such as Iran s "ballistic
  missile programme and its support for terrorism." Earlier this month, Iran s supreme
  leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to rule out any immediate prospect of talks,
  saying "there will be neither war, nor negotiations," with the US. Washington s
  lawyers will present their case on Tuesday, with experts believing they are to challenge
  the ICJ s jurisdiction. '

text: 'Nearly half the world s schools lack clean drinking water, toilets and handwashing
  facilities, putting millions of children at risk of disease, experts warned on Monday.
  Almost 900 million children have to contend with a lack of basic hygiene facilities
  during their education, putting their health at risk and meaning some have to miss
  school.  You can t have a quality learning environment without these basics,  said
  Dr Rick Johnston of the World Health Organization, a lead researcher on the project.  Children
  may not come to school at all if there s no toilets ... Then, when they are at school,
  they are not going to at their very best if they not able to use a decent toilet
  or if they are not properly hydrated.  World leaders have signed up to global pledges
  to provide safe water and hygiene facilities for all and ensure every child gets
  a comprehensive education by 2030 under the UN s sustainable development goals.
  A lack of safe water and sanitation facilities can cause dehydration, illness, and
  even death. But many children are forced to risk their health to take part in classes,
  according to the report produced jointly by the United Nations Children s Fund UNICEF
  and the WHO, the first to look specifically at provision in schools. It found nearly
  a third of primary and secondary schools lacked a safe and reliable drinking water
  supply, affecting nearly 570 million children. Nearly 20 per cent of schools had
  no safe drinking water at all. Just over a third of schools lacked adequate toilet
  facilities, affecting more than 620 million children. Almost one in five primary
  schools and one in eight secondary schools were considered to have no sanitation.
  Nearly half lacked proper handwashing facilities, essential for helping prevent
  the spread of infections and disease. Nearly 900 million children were affected,
  the report found. Sub-Saharan Africa, East and Southeast Asia had some of the worst
  facilities.  It s deeply shocking,  Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of charity
  WaterAid, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The consequences are very broad
  in terms of children s access to education, general health and state of nutrition.  Adolescent
  girls in particular are often forced to miss classes when they are on their periods
  if there are no proper cleaning and sanitation facilities, he said. More than a
  third of girls in South Asia miss school during their periods, often because they
  lack access to toilets or pads, according to a WaterAid and UNICEF study earlier
  this year. The World Bank last year warned countries needed to quadruple spending
  to $150 billion a year to deliver universal safe water and sanitation. However,
  experts say they are optimistic the situation can be quickly improved if leaders
  treat water, sanitation and hygiene as a priority.  With political will, it really
  is possible to deliver good quality services,  said Johnston. '

  \ put both hands on the trophy, but also add shine to it.But then there are the\
  \ few who worked their hearts out, but somehow success and luck refused to favour\
  \ them. Here is a look at World Cups 5 captivating individual performances that\
  \ failed to win games.1-Martin Crowe, New Zealand 1992Semi-Final against Pakistan,\
  \ 83 ball 91 runsThe 1992 Cup was a time to restructure the game. Cricket was coming\
  \ to innovative Australasia and the Kerry Packer touch was impacting to revolutionize\
  \ the game on big stage. The traditional red ball and white screens were replaced\
  \ with white and black respectively. Multicolored kits and games under flood lights\
  \ gave cricket and viewers a fresh experience.Led by the maverick Martin Crowe,\
  \ NZ were the team to beat in 92. Crowe was enjoying the form of his life leading\
  \ his team to the semis with 7 straight wins against one defeat. With all his weapons\
  \ and tactics syncing together, Crowe was eyeing to be part of Kiwi folklore. Coming\
  \ in to bat at 39/2, Crowe dominated the spirited Pakistani attack and with 7 fours\
  \ and 3 sixes set Eden Park on fire. Lifting the total to a nerve soothing 262,\
  \ Martin had changed into shorts and was already planning strategies for the final.But\
  \ sadly, few things didn\u2019t go his way, the weather report that had forecasted\
  \ huge downpour resisted till the last ball, while batting he pulled a hamstring,\
  \ his decision not to take the field and letting his deputy John Wright take charge\
  \ and finally little known BIG-INZI hitting a match winning 37 ball 60. His was\
  \ the World Cup\u2019s sparkling performance that fell to some ill-planning, thus\
  \ ending in a national heartbreak.2- Javagal Srinath, India 1996Semi-Final against\
  \ Sri Lanka, 3 for 34Don\u2019t be puzzled by Jaggu Dadas figures, for those who\
  \ knew the mindset and lethality of the Sri Lankan batting line of those days, it\
  \ was equivalent of walking barefooted on burning charcoals. Under Dav Whatmore,\
  \ the Lankans had set a new meaning for early over slogs. Where 60 in first 15 were\
  \ considered a healthy score, Little Romesh Kaluwitharana and Sanath Jayasuriya\
  \ made a mockery of bowling lines by smashing 100\u2019s off 10\u2019s.With this\
  \ slaughtering attitude, Sri Lankans came to face India at Eden Garden, the cricketing\
  \ Heart of the nation. To win their nations heart, Azharuddin\u2019s men had to\
  \ put a courageous display. The Mysore Express did exactly that when he penned the\
  \ unthinkable script, removing both openers in the first over with just ONE run\
  \ on the board. For the 90 thousand plus fanatic Indian fans, it was enough to lay\
  \ their hearts on Srinaths feet.The Mysore Express then puffed more steam to remove\
  \ Asanka Gurusinha, Sri Lanka were bleeding 3 for 35. The dream of a billion was\
  \ about to see light but Aravinda De Silvas fighting fifty and a dramatic Indian\
  \ batting collapse shattered that dream. The riots that followed would be remembered\
  \ as the most humiliating day in Indian Cricket.3- Lance Klusener - The Choke of\
  \ the Century1999 Semi-final against Australia, 16 ball 31 runsBy 1999 the Proteas\
  \ were the leading force in World cricket and arguably the most lethal unit in the\
  \ Cup. They were creating havocs in opponent ranks thanks to one of the most swashbuckling\
  \ hitters of all time. Lance Klusener had the natural ability to tear apart even\
  \ the most balanced and orchestrated bowling attack.The man they call Zulu was in\
  \ magical form, scoring 250 in 8 innings and also pocketing 17 important wickets.\
  \ But his fairytale run had to come to a sorry end, in the most dramatic fashion,\
  \ against the most worthy opponents, in one of the most thrilling matches ever contested.In\
  \ a fluctuating match that never seemed to have a clear winner, Klusener walked\
  \ in with South Africa needing 39 runs in 5 over\u2019s, Steve Waugh\u2019s men\
  \ were smelling victory, but to tease their nostrils Zulu was the last man standing.What\
  \ seemed like a daunting task, Klusener make it look like a walk in the park. With\
  \ 9 required from the last over, the hero of 96 semis Damien Fleming was trusted\
  \ to deliver once again. Klusener on the other hand showed no respect and hammered\
  \ the first 2 balls for consecutive boundaries. With the scores level only one was\
  \ required off 4 balls. That\u2019s where the panic happened and the term \u201C\
  Chokers\u201D gained substance. Klusener pushed the ball to mid-off for the winning\
  \ run, but he and his partner Allan Donald blundered with the basic principle of\
  \ running between the wickets. Australia moved to the finals while Klusener would\
  \ be remembered for this infamous comic, tragic and chock run out. 4- Wahab Riaz\
  \ \u2013 Viki\u2019s biggest yet saddest day2011 Semi-final against India, 5 for\
  \ 4630th March was a big day for 2011 World Cup, yet it turned out to be a day Wahab\
  \ Riaz would remember for his topsy turvy fortunes. Called in to replace knee nursing\
  \ Shoaib Akhtar, the lively Mohali pitch was ready for Wahab to bang in hard. Having\
  \ spent three sleepless nights cooking his strategy against Dhoni\u2019s men, both\
  \ Wahab and his luck were itching to shine.While the more experienced Umar Gul received\
  \ hammering, Wahab dried runs and kept picking big names. The highlight was dismissing\
  \ India\u2019s darling Yuvi on the first ball full toss, a ball enough to make Shoaib\
  \ himself jump in the dressing room. Wahab would then ignition the airplane celebration,\
  \ a trade mark registered by Shoaib himself. Wahab\u2019s first 5 wicket haul would\
  \ restrict India to a challenging 260 to defend, a job only to be made easy by yet\
  \ another Pakistani batting collapse.5- Mahela Jayawardene \u2013 The Big Match\
  \ Performer2011 World Cup final against India, 88 ball 103Mahela Jayawardene's high-classic\
  \ 100 at Wankhede did not deserve to be the only one of six in World Cup finals\
  \ to not have been good enough to earn the maker's side the trophy. Majestic Mahela\
  \ had played the 2007 final as a captain and this time he was Sangakkara\u2019s\
  \ main hope.Coming in at 2 for 60, The Islanders needed a partnership going to get\
  \ the cup. It was time for Mahela to bring out his years of experience and construct\
  \ an empire brick by brick. In-font of an incredibly hostile Mumbaians, his signature\
  \ strokes not only imposed a graveyard silence but reverted the pressure right back\
  \ on the Indian bowlers.Like a true spirited fighter, he helped build up a healthy\
  \ 62 runs partnership with Sanga and made sure he survived the full 50 over\u2019\

text: 'ISLAMABAD: Members of opposition parties lambasted the Pakistan Peoples Party
  on Monday for their failure to nominate a joint candidate for the upcoming presidential
  election.  The grand alliance of opposition parties had initially resolved to field
  a joint candidate for the country s presidency. The PPP, however, stuck to Aitzaz
  Ahsan as its choice for the presidential nomination despite the Pakistan Muslim
  League-Nawaz s objections. The rest of the opposition eventually fielded Maulana
  Fazlur Rahman for the slot earlier today. Dr Arif Alvi is the presidential candidate
  nominated by the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Addressing a joint press
  conference, PML-N leader and former interior minister Ahsan Iqbal criticised the
  PPP for failing to end the deadlock and expressed hope that the party will review
  its decision and prevent the opposition s vote from splitting.  Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal
  (MMA) leader Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri thanked the opposition alliance for nominating
  Maulana Fazl for the post, while regretting the PPP s lack of support to the opposition
  s cause.  Haideri further said that as per the opposition s calculations, Fazl looked
  in a position to win the presidential polls.  Arif Alvi, Aitzaz Ahsan and Maulana
  Fazl submit nomination papers for presidency  Opposition parties except PPP decided
  to field the JUI-F chief for the post of the country''s president Terming the PPP
  s decision as  shocking , National Party leader Hasil Khan Bizenjo lamented the
  failure of the grand alliance to put up a strong front on the matter.   The way
  PPP backed out was shocking,  he said.  All the parties had asked PPP to propose
  another name.  It was not possible for PML-N to vote for Aitzaz Ahsan, Bizenjo added.  The
  deadline for candidates to submit their nomination papers for the upcoming presidential
  election ended at noon today. Polling for the presidential election will be held
  on September 4.  '

  its water-holding capacity. Pakistan is of the view that India has violated the
  Indus Waters Treaty by starting construction of reservoirs at a time when Pakistan
  is reeling from severe water shortage.  According to sources, a nine-member Indian
  delegation headed by Indian Water Commissioner P K Saxena will arrive in Pakistan
  tomorrow to hold talks over the matter. The Pakistani delegation is headed by Pakistan
  Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Meher Ali Shah.  Following meetings between the
  two parties, a joint notification would be issued.  The projects by India have been
  started on Chenab River, which violate the Indus Waters Treaty signed between the
  two countries, sources said.  Officials have confirmed that India wanted to place
  spillway of 1,000 megawatts of Pakal Dul Dam on Chenab River in Indian-occupied
  Kashmir, about 15 metres down against the permissible limit, which will give the
  country undue leverage of holding 11,000 acres of feet water in addition to allowed
  volume of water storage, The News reported.  India wanted to establish water storage
  capacity of 88,000 acre feet on Chenab River with the setting up of Pakal Dul Dam.
  Pakal Dul Dam is a reservoir-based scheme currently under construction on river
  Marusudar, the main right bank tributary of Chenab River in Kishtwar tehsil of Doda
  district in Jammu and Kashmir, while lower Kalnai project is of 48 megawatts on
  another tributary of the river.  '

text: 'Jailed Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh began a hunger strike in
  prison on Saturday, she announced in a note posted on her husband s Facebook page.
  Sotoudeh said she was launching her protest over the recent arrest of a prominent
  civil rights activist and the harassment of his, and her own, family by security
  forces. Sotoudeh served about half of a six-year jail sentence imposed in 2010 for
  spreading propaganda and conspiring to harm state security   charges she denied   before
  being freed in 2013. She was arrested again in June and her husband, Reza Khandan,
  told Iranian media she is facing security charges. "Since none of my correspondence
  with the authorities has produced a result, I have no choice but to start a hunger
  strike as of [August 25, 2018] in protest against the judicial arrests and pressure
  against my family, relatives and friends," Sotoudeh wrote on Khandan s Facebook
  page. She added the words: "With the hope of the establishment of law and justice
  in our dear country Iran." Sotoudeh, who has represented Iranian opposition activists,
  embarked on an earlier 50-day hunger strike in 2012 against a travel ban on her
  daughter. Her case then caused an international outcry in which the United States
  and the human rights group Amnesty International criticised Iran and she was freed
  in September 2013 ahead of a visit to the United Nations by President Hassan Rouhani,
  soon after he was swept into office in part on promises of liberal reforms. Sotoudeh
  recently represented a number of women who have removed their headscarves in public
  to protest against Iran s mandatory dress code for women, according to the Center
  for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group. '

text: 'Investors on Monday will render their verdict on Tesla Chief Executive Elon
  Musk s decision to abandon a proposed $72 billion buyout to take the luxury electric
  car maker private.  Musk said in a blog post late on Friday that his decision to
  scuttle the proposed deal was motivated in part by existing Tesla shareholders who
  said they wanted the company to remain publicly-traded. The trading on Monday will
  be a test of how investors are taking the demise of the buyout plan, and their views
  on whether Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, can avoid going back to capital
  markets to raise more cash. Tesla s shares already had fallen nearly 10 percent
  below their level on Aug. 7, just before Musk tweeted that he had  funding secured  for
  a buyout at $420 a share. Investors in Tesla s bonds and convertible debt also had
  shown skepticism that the buyout would materialize during the days after that tweet,
  and a subsequent blog post in which Musk made a case for going private. With Musk
  s idea of a buyout backed by Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund off the table,
  investors will focus on Tesla s efforts to become profitable, the company s cash
  reserves and what steps Musk could take to raise fresh capital. Musk and Tesla also
  face a series of investor lawsuits and a US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation
  into the factual accuracy of Musk s tweet that funding for the buyout deal was  secured.  Tesla
  had $2.78 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, after a record $718
  million loss. In early August, before the buyout plan was made public, Tesla reiterated
  a forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, under
  normal accounting rules, and Musk said the company would not need to raise more
  cash. A Tesla spokesman on Sunday referred to those previous comments. One of Tesla
  s biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3,
  which is critical to its profitability goals. Tapping capital markets Analysts have
  suggested a capital raise may be required soon to boost investor confidence. Musk
  and Tesla could hold off on any fundraising plans for the time being, in part tapping
  capital markets would contradict Musk s comments about Tesla being adequately funded,
  investment bankers who are not working for the company said over the weekend. This
  week would also be an inopportune time for a capital raising, given that many bankers
  and investors are away ahead of the Sept. 3 Labour Day holiday.  The high price
  investors have put on Tesla s shares has allowed Musk to expand US production, invest
  in building out a vehicle charging network and start work on new models including
  a small sport utility vehicle, a new Roadster and a semi-truck even as the company
  burned cash. Tesla earlier this year announced plans to build a battery and vehicle
  assembly complex in China. Musk said earlier this month the company s  default plan  would
  be to fund that expansion by borrowing money from Chinese banks. '

  of the Senate Standing Committee on Inter-Provincial Coordination chaired by Senator
  Mushahidullah, said Islamabad United players Sharjeel Khan, Khalid Latif and Mohammad
  Irfan met the bookie named Yousuf during the Pakistan Super League but did not inform
  the PCB s Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU). According to Shahryar Khan, the evidence gathered
  by the ACU shows that Sharjeel followed through on his agreement with the bookie
  in Islamabad United s opening match in PSL. Latif was willing to do the same but
  he did not play that match. Mohammad Irfan, however, did not pay attention to the
  bookie s instructions but he still did not notify the board, due to which the pacer
  is still under investigation, Khan elaborated. Nasir Jamshed arranged meeting with
  bookie The PCB chairman informed the committee that bookies do not approach players
  directly. They either make contacts with the players  relatives or former players
  who can get them in touch with their intended targets.  The bookie Yousuf met Nasir
  Jamshed, and both of them came to Dubai from London. Nasir Jamshed said to the players
  that a man wants to meet them, and arranged meeting of Sharjeel, Latif and Irfan
  with the bookie,  Khan explained. The PCB s ACU, however, was alert throughout and
  knew such an incident could happen, which is why such swift action was taken against
  the players, the chairman added.  Match fixing is universal. Bookies come to wherever
  T20 matches are played. They also come to India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The first
  edition of PSL was successful, hence the bookies came to the second edition of the
  league,  Khan noted.   '

  \ reply from Azhar Mehmood, one of the finest all rounders of the 21st century,\
  \ as we discuss that fateful day of March 17, 2007. Painfully remembered as the\
  \ darkest day in Pakistan Cricket, it was the same day that brought down the curtains\
  \ on Azhar\u2019s otherwise celebrated career.Ironically, it was Azhar\u2019s slower\
  \ ball that was picked early by Irish skipper Trent Johnston and he hit the ball\
  \ high and handsome to foster some of the craziest celebrations in Irish Cricket\
  \ history.No wonder, this is one game Azhar never feels comfortable discussing.Meanwhile,\
  \ Mohammad Yousuf is quick to point out the grudge ICC had towards Pakistan as they\
  \ did their part in assisting Ireland, \u201CGreen top wicket was deliberately prepared\
  \ for our match\u201D.He was also cynical about the media trial that followed, \u201C\
  We can\u2019t forget how media bashed us after that match, India lost to Bangladesh\
  \ in the same World Cup but their media didn't give them the same treatment\u201D\
  .Background2007 was probably the darkest year in Pakistan cricket. To start off\
  \ with, they never had the ideal preparations walking into the Mega Event. A 3-1\
  \ drubbing against the Protease on their home ground did little to boost their confidence.\
  \ That defeat was followed by another scratchy performance against the West-Indies\
  \ in the tournament opener where Lara\u2019s men handed them a 54 run defeat.On\
  \ the other side, a splendid century by Jeremy Bray helped Ireland fight out a thrilling\
  \ tie against the much experienced Zimbabweans. Don\u2019t forget, this was their\
  \ first ever World Cup.From there on, the stage was set for the Irish to step up\
  \ and lock arms with the big boys. Their next obstruction was the Sub-continent\
  \ giants, Pakistan. With a reputation of always being ready for self destruction,\
  \ they were just the kind of opponents the Irish needed to engineer the greatest\
  \ upset in modern cricket. Iceberg, right ahead!!!This was not going to be Pakistan\u2019\
  s day, and that was evident with the first proceeding of the day when Johnston called\
  \ correctly at the toss and sent Pakistan to bat on a grass top wicket.It was also\
  \ the Irish National holiday known as St. Patrick's Day and somehow the grass on\
  \ the pitch matched the Irish shade of green, perhaps setting the right ingredients\
  \ for a National Feast later in the day.Years later, Irish Off spinner Kyle McCallan\
  \ admitted he was shocked to see the green top wicket,\u201CThe pitch was absolutely\
  \ green and that played into our hands as Irish players are used to such pitches\
  \ whereas there are not many such wickets in Pakistan, so when Johnston won the\
  \ Toss we could see an opportunity to exploit\u201D. The Pakistani camp knew it\
  \ was not going to be an easy outing either. Their coach; the Late Bob Woolmer described\
  \ the game as a \u201CSerious banana skin fixture\u201D.The Irish had done their\
  \ homework; it took Langford- Smith just six balls to find flaws in Hafiz\u2019\
  s technique when he made him edge an away swinger to the keeper.That top order jolt\
  \ was too much for the incoming batsmen and they kept leaving the field in haste,\
  \ as if hot chicken biryani was being served in the dressing room.Such was the accuracy\
  \ in the Irish bowling and juice in the wicket that seven Pakistani batsmen failed\
  \ to reach double figures. Imran Nazir did little to stabilise things with 24 while\
  \ Kamran Akmal resisted with a hard fought 27 to stretch the score to a miserable\
  \ 132.That done, Ireland had done half the job, but their smiles were cautious as\
  \ they knew a treacherous ride awaited them ahead.Captain Inspirational 132 was\
  \ a small total, but suddenly started to look huge for the newcomers, it was their\
  \ first such situation and no surprises that nervousness started trickling in. The\
  \ innings break was a tricky time and someone needed to spark their self belief.\
  \ It was time for Trent Johnston to give the Irish version of the Cornered Tigers\
  \ speech, \u201CGuys, we have a massive chance to make it to the super 8, you have\
  \ a chance to stay in the West-Indies for another four weeks. I promise you it\u2019\
  s going to be very difficult out there, it\u2019s up to each one of us to see how\
  \ much we want to stay here.\u201DAndrew White has a big laugh remembering his words,\
  \ \u201CDo you want to stay here or go back to Dublin, waking up at 6 am Monday\
  \ morning and deliver posts?\u201D\u201CScore these runs and we will all be heroes,\u201D\
  \u2026and heroes they became.Pakistan fight back\u201CWe knew we had to give it\
  \ everything, because if we lost, our WC was over, and the only way to do that was\
  \ to take early wickets\u201D, recalls Azhar Mehmood.And strike well they did with\
  \ M. Sami generating lightening pace to get rid of Jeremy Bray and the current English\
  \ Captain Eoin Morgan as Irish were licking their wounds at 15 for 2.Ireland needed\
  \ a hero to steady their ship and Niall O\u2019Brian decided to place himself in\
  \ the modern Irish folklore. In the tense chase his hard fought 72 took the game\
  \ out of Pakistan\u2019s hands.Shoaib Malik did eventually get rid of him but the\
  \ damage had been done. Rao Iftikhar then struck twice in quick succession to put\
  \ the Irish fans in doubt, but Kevin O Brian and ultimately Skipper Johnston made\
  \ sure the fairly-tale ride doesn\u2019t come to an abrupt end.Things get uglier\
  \ for PakistanIreland became the story of the Cup; they went out to beat Bangladesh,\
  \ proving to the world that the win against Pakistan was not just a fluke.For Pakistan,\
  \ all hell broke loose. Sarfaraz Nawaz, who had already accused them for underperforming\
  \ against the West-Indies, suggested the body language clearly indicated that they\
  \ were not interested in winning.The way Pakistan lost their wickets also raised\
  \ many eyebrows, with some former cricketers smelling foulplay as all their 10 batsmen\
  \ were out caught.As if turning another chapter from an Alfred Hitchcock thriller,\
  \ Bob-Woolmer was found dead in his room next morning. The news was shocking and\
  \ the reactions were mixed. Some felt he was a man of dignity and couldn\u2019t\
  \ digest the humiliation, others believed he was strangled by some match-fixing\
  \ mafia fearing he might spill beans for them, the official word cited natural causes.However,\
  \ his death is shrouded in mystery till today. Pakistan were forced out of the Cup\
  \ while Inzamam called it a day.But for Azhar and Yousuf, it was a matter of poor\
  \ performance and basic mistakes. \u201CWe simply played bad cricket and it was\
  \ not our day, I don\u2019t see any reason to doubt the results\u201D, Yousuf tries\
  \ to put to rest any further probing questions.Azhar is quick to add, \u201CIreland\
  \ were a better team on that day, they played well and read the conditions. We fought\
  \ back hard but an appeal against Neill was turned down and that took the game away\u201D\
  .That was eight years ago, on Sunday things would be favoring Pakistan as the wicket\
  \ at Adelaide Oval gives a sub-continent feeling and has produced interesting results\
  \ in the two matches played in the Cup. With both teams looking in good form and\
  \ eyeing the third spot, fans can only expect a cliffhanger."

  \ enforcer embraced martyrdom while 4 others were injured. Weapons and mobile phones\
  \ were also recovered from Kurd\u2019s possession. Intelligence sources revealed,\
  \ that Kurd was a known terrorist and the mastermind of all major sectarian attacks\

  \ Kurd was apprehended once before, but managed to escape from a high security prison.\
  \ He was apprehended by an intelligence agency along with the Sindh CID in December\
  \ 2005 from Cattle colony in Karachi. After his arrest from the metropolis, he was\
  \ shifted to Quetta where he was kept at the Anti Terrorist Force\u2019s high security\
  \ prison inside Quetta Cantonment. Astonishingly in 2008, he escaped from the fortified\
  \ prison and remained at large till Sunday, when he was killed.According to his\
  \ interrogation report, seen by this scribe, Kurd was one of 8 siblings born to\
  \ Noor Mohammad who hailed from a poor background. At the young age of 15, he began\
  \ driving an oil tanker and later joined Dawood Badini another oil tanker driver.\
  \ Badini\u2019s father was Mulana Ameer Hamza Badini, the leader of the proscribed\
  \ Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan \u2013 renamed as Ahle Sunnat Wal Jammat (ASWJ). Badini\
  \ is the nephew of al-Qaeda\u2019s former operational commander and No. 3, Khalid\
  \ Sheikh Mohammad. He is also the brother-in-law of Ramzi Yousaf, who executed the\
  \ first terror attack in the United States in 1993 at the World Trade Center in\
  \ New York. Saifullah Kurd began visiting gatherings hosted by Badini\u2019s father,\
  \ Ameer Hamza and under his influence joined the proscribed Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan.\
  \ In 1998, Saifullah Kurd first met with Riaz Basra, the founder of banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi\
  \ in Kabul, Afghanistan. A recently executed terrorist Shabbir aka Doctor was also\
  \ present during the meeting. It was in Afghanistan that Kurd received 20-days of\
  \ training at the Khalid Bin Waleed training camp run by banned Harkat-ul-Mujahideen,\
  \ where he was trained on how to use pistols and AK-47 assault rifles by his trainer,\
  \ Ustad Usama.Kurd stayed in Afghanistan for a month and returned to Quetta via\
  \ Kabul, Khandhar and Chaman. He carried out his first sectarian assault in October\
  \ 6, 1999 on Zarghoon Road in Quetta. Along with two aides, Saifullah ambushed the\
  \ vehicle of the then head of the Hazara tribe and provincial minister for education,\
  \ Sardar Nisar Hazara. The minister and his bodyguard were injured while his driver\
  \ lost his life in the attack. For their direct involvement in terrorist attacks,\
  \ both Kurd and Badini were sentenced to death by an Anti-Terrorist Court in Quetta\

text: 'LAHORE: The National College of Arts in Lahore on Friday announced a week''s
  holiday, after which the hostel administration ordered students to immediately vacate
  their dormitories. The NCA administration ordered students to vacate three hostels;
  two for boys and a girls'' dormitory. With this, around 300 students, male and female,
  have been stranded due to administration negligence. All of these students come
  from distant cities and areas in the province, while some hail from outside Punjab.
  Geo News has learnt that police had given a notice to hostel administration a week
  ago. They said that they had repeatedly asked the administration to improve security,
  before finally getting the hostels vacated tonight upon non-compliance of orders
  by admin staff. Reached for comment, hostel administration declined the request.
  Police said the hostels will not be reopened until adequate security arrangements
  are made. The situation also perplexed the parents of the students, who questioned
  where would their children go at this hour of night. The students, outside the hostels,
  were found calling their relatives and friends in Lahore in search of a temporary
  place to stay at. No institute asked to get hostels vacated: DIG On the other hand,
  DIG Operations Lahore Haider Ashraf denied that the police asked NCA administration
  to get the hostels vacated. "We have not asked administration of any educational
  institution to get its hostels vacated," Ashraf said, adding that police were providing
  foolproof security to all institutes. '

  \ argue that history only reserves space for performances that fetch laurels, and\
  \ rightly so. Putting his weight behind this thought, the great American football\
  \ coach Vince Lombardi had famously said, \u201CWinning isn\u2019t everything, it\u2019\
  s the only thing\u201D, thus setting an unshakable standard for generations to come.\
  \ The greats of international cricket would interpret his word no differently and\
  \ stretch every muscle to put their names on the winners list. World Cup, the greatest\
  \ showpiece in world cricket has been witness to some of the most memorable acts\
  \ the game had to offer. The majestic performances of Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards,\
  \ Kapil Dev, Inzamam, De Silva, Ponting, Yuvraj etc helped their teams not only\
  \ put both hands on the trophy, but also add shine to it.But then there are the\
  \ few who worked their hearts out, but somehow success and luck refused to favour\
  \ them. Here is a look at World Cups 5 captivating individual performances that\
  \ failed to win games.1-Martin Crowe, New Zealand 1992Semi-Final against Pakistan,\
  \ 83 ball 91 runsThe 1992 Cup was a time to restructure the game. Cricket was coming\
  \ to innovative Australasia and the Kerry Packer touch was impacting to revolutionize\
  \ the game on big stage. The traditional red ball and white screens were replaced\
  \ with white and black respectively. Multicolored kits and games under flood lights\
  \ gave cricket and viewers a fresh experience.Led by the maverick Martin Crowe,\
  \ NZ were the team to beat in 92. Crowe was enjoying the form of his life leading\
  \ his team to the semis with 7 straight wins against one defeat. With all his weapons\
  \ and tactics syncing together, Crowe was eyeing to be part of Kiwi folklore. Coming\
  \ in to bat at 39/2, Crowe dominated the spirited Pakistani attack and with 7 fours\
  \ and 3 sixes set Eden Park on fire. Lifting the total to a nerve soothing 262,\
  \ Martin had changed into shorts and was already planning strategies for the final.But\
  \ sadly, few things didn\u2019t go his way, the weather report that had forecasted\
  \ huge downpour resisted till the last ball, while batting he pulled a hamstring,\
  \ his decision not to take the field and letting his deputy John Wright take charge\
  \ and finally little known BIG-INZI hitting a match winning 37 ball 60. His was\
  \ the World Cup\u2019s sparkling performance that fell to some ill-planning, thus\
  \ ending in a national heartbreak.2- Javagal Srinath, India 1996Semi-Final against\
  \ Sri Lanka, 3 for 34Don\u2019t be puzzled by Jaggu Dadas figures, for those who\
  \ knew the mindset and lethality of the Sri Lankan batting line of those days, it\
  \ was equivalent of walking barefooted on burning charcoals. Under Dav Whatmore,\
  \ the Lankans had set a new meaning for early over slogs. Where 60 in first 15 were\
  \ considered a healthy score, Little Romesh Kaluwitharana and Sanath Jayasuriya\
  \ made a mockery of bowling lines by smashing 100\u2019s off 10\u2019s.With this\
  \ slaughtering attitude, Sri Lankans came to face India at Eden Garden, the cricketing\
  \ Heart of the nation. To win their nations heart, Azharuddin\u2019s men had to\
  \ put a courageous display. The Mysore Express did exactly that when he penned the\
  \ unthinkable script, removing both openers in the first over with just ONE run\
  \ on the board. For the 90 thousand plus fanatic Indian fans, it was enough to lay\
  \ their hearts on Srinaths feet.The Mysore Express then puffed more steam to remove\
  \ Asanka Gurusinha, Sri Lanka were bleeding 3 for 35. The dream of a billion was\
  \ about to see light but Aravinda De Silvas fighting fifty and a dramatic Indian\
  \ batting collapse shattered that dream. The riots that followed would be remembered\
  \ as the most humiliating day in Indian Cricket.3- Lance Klusener - The Choke of\
  \ the Century1999 Semi-final against Australia, 16 ball 31 runsBy 1999 the Proteas\
  \ were the leading force in World cricket and arguably the most lethal unit in the\
  \ Cup. They were creating havocs in opponent ranks thanks to one of the most swashbuckling\
  \ hitters of all time. Lance Klusener had the natural ability to tear apart even\
  \ the most balanced and orchestrated bowling attack.The man they call Zulu was in\
  \ magical form, scoring 250 in 8 innings and also pocketing 17 important wickets.\
  \ But his fairytale run had to come to a sorry end, in the most dramatic fashion,\
  \ against the most worthy opponents, in one of the most thrilling matches ever contested.In\
  \ a fluctuating match that never seemed to have a clear winner, Klusener walked\
  \ in with South Africa needing 39 runs in 5 over\u2019s, Steve Waugh\u2019s men\
  \ were smelling victory, but to tease their nostrils Zulu was the last man standing.What\
  \ seemed like a daunting task, Klusener make it look like a walk in the park. With\
  \ 9 required from the last over, the hero of 96 semis Damien Fleming was trusted\
  \ to deliver once again. Klusener on the other hand showed no respect and hammered\
  \ the first 2 balls for consecutive boundaries. With the scores level only one was\
  \ required off 4 balls. That\u2019s where the panic happened and the term \u201C\
  Chokers\u201D gained substance. Klusener pushed the ball to mid-off for the winning\
  \ run, but he and his partner Allan Donald blundered with the basic principle of\
  \ running between the wickets. Australia moved to the finals while Klusener would\
  \ be remembered for this infamous comic, tragic and chock run out. 4- Wahab Riaz\
  \ \u2013 Viki\u2019s biggest yet saddest day2011 Semi-final against India, 5 for\
  \ 4630th March was a big day for 2011 World Cup, yet it turned out to be a day Wahab\
  \ Riaz would remember for his topsy turvy fortunes. Called in to replace knee nursing\
  \ Shoaib Akhtar, the lively Mohali pitch was ready for Wahab to bang in hard. Having\
  \ spent three sleepless nights cooking his strategy against Dhoni\u2019s men, both\
  \ Wahab and his luck were itching to shine.While the more experienced Umar Gul received\
  \ hammering, Wahab dried runs and kept picking big names. The highlight was dismissing\
  \ India\u2019s darling Yuvi on the first ball full toss, a ball enough to make Shoaib\
  \ himself jump in the dressing room. Wahab would then ignition the airplane celebration,\
  \ a trade mark registered by Shoaib himself. Wahab\u2019s first 5 wicket haul would\
  \ restrict India to a challenging 260 to defend, a job only to be made easy by yet\
  \ another Pakistani batting collapse.5- Mahela Jayawardene \u2013 The Big Match\
  \ Performer2011 World Cup final against India, 88 ball 103Mahela Jayawardene's high-classic\
  \ 100 at Wankhede did not deserve to be the only one of six in World Cup finals\
  \ to not have been good enough to earn the maker's side the trophy. Majestic Mahela\
  \ had played the 2007 final as a captain and this time he was Sangakkara\u2019s\
  \ main hope.Coming in at 2 for 60, The Islanders needed a partnership going to get\
  \ the cup. It was time for Mahela to bring out his years of experience and construct\
  \ an empire brick by brick. In-font of an incredibly hostile Mumbaians, his signature\
  \ strokes not only imposed a graveyard silence but reverted the pressure right back\
  \ on the Indian bowlers.Like a true spirited fighter, he helped build up a healthy\
  \ 62 runs partnership with Sanga and made sure he survived the full 50 over\u2019\
  s to see his team to a commanding 274. But the prayers of a billion crept in and\
  \ Dhoni played the innings of his life to deprive Mahela of cricketing immortality."

  so far this year, according to figures collected by AFP as India counts the rising
  toll from floods that have devastated southern Kerala state.  The monsoon, which
  lasts from June to September, causes widespread death and destruction across South
  Asia each year, with the tourist hotspot of Kerala suffering its worst floods in
  nearly 100 years. Kerala has reported 445 deaths with more bodies discovered each
  day as a massive cleanup gets underway. The floods forced more than a million people
  to seek shelter in temporary relief camps and 15 others were reported missing up
  to Monday.  Kerala accounted for nearly half of the more than 1,000 deaths reported
  across India, with over 160 killed in neighbouring Karnataka state, more than 200
  fatalities in Uttar Pradesh state, and 195 in West Bengal, according to official
  figures. The monsoon also battered Nepal, with 87 people killed since June, according
  to the home ministry, including a woman and eight children swept away by a landslide
  in a remote village. But in Sri Lanka, where authorities organised the early evacuation
  of 750,000 people in threatened areas this year, the death toll from monsoon floods
  fell to 24 from 224 killed in May and June last year, official figures showed. In
  Bangladesh, floods and landslides killed at least 29 people, according to official
  figures. In the deadliest monsoon-induced disaster in recent years in South Asia,
  flooding and landslides killed around 5,800 people in India s northern Uttarakhand
  state in June 2013. '

  The Islamabad United ambassador was speaking to Geo.TV, where she was asked if there
  should be a PSL for women cricketers to go along with the theme of women empowerment.
  Momina said that it s an important theme that should be highlighted. Giving an example
  of her team s fellow female ambassadors, who happen to be female cricketers too,
  the singer said that the sport should be promoted at the same level for both genders.
  Girls should also excel in this field, she said. When asked that if other teams
  should also take a leaf out of Islamabad United s book as far as the addition of
  female cricket ambassadors goes, Momina said that not only franchises, the entire
  nation should be promoting this initiative.  We need to set a precedent so we get

text: 'United Nations investigators on Monday called for an international probe and
  prosecution of Myanmar''s army chief and five other top military commanders for
  genocide against the country''s Rohingya minority.  "Myanmar''s top military generals,
  including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated
  and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes
  against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States," a UN-backed
  fact-finding mission said. Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled northern Rakhine state
  to Bangladesh after Myanmar launched a brutal crackdown last August on insurgents
  amid accounts of arson, murder and rape at the hands of soldiers and vigilante mobs
  in the mainly Buddhist country. Myanmar has vehemently denied allegations of ethnic
  cleansing, insisting it was responding to attacks by Rohingya rebels.  But in Monday
  s report, the UN mission insisted the army tactics had been "consistently and grossly
  disproportionate to actual security threats." The mission, which was created by
  the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017, concluded in a report that "there is
  sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials
  in the Tatmadaw (Myanmar army) chain of command." "The crimes in Rakhine State,
  and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and
  scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,"
  the report said. The investigators named Min Aung Hlaing and five other top military
  commanders, adding that a longer list of names could be shared with "any competent
  and credible body pursuing accountability in line with international norms and standards."
  Criticism was also directed at Myanmar s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel
  Peace Prize laureate who has been the target of global vitriol for a perceived failure
  to stand up for the stateless minority. The report found that she had "not used
  her de facto position as head of government, nor her moral authority, to stem or
  prevent the unfolding events."  While acknowledging that she and other civilian
  authorities had little influence on military actions, it said that they "through
  their acts and omissions... have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes."
  The investigators called on the UN Security Council to refer the Myanmar situation
  to the International Criminal Court, or for an ad hoc international criminal tribunal
  to be created. They also recommended an arms embargo and "targeted individual sanctions
  against those who appear to be most responsible." '

text: 'Nearly half the world s schools lack clean drinking water, toilets and handwashing
  facilities, putting millions of children at risk of disease, experts warned on Monday.
  Almost 900 million children have to contend with a lack of basic hygiene facilities
  during their education, putting their health at risk and meaning some have to miss
  school.  You can t have a quality learning environment without these basics,  said
  Dr Rick Johnston of the World Health Organization, a lead researcher on the project.  Children
  may not come to school at all if there s no toilets ... Then, when they are at school,
  they are not going to at their very best if they not able to use a decent toilet
  or if they are not properly hydrated.  World leaders have signed up to global pledges
  to provide safe water and hygiene facilities for all and ensure every child gets
  a comprehensive education by 2030 under the UN s sustainable development goals.
  A lack of safe water and sanitation facilities can cause dehydration, illness, and
  even death. But many children are forced to risk their health to take part in classes,
  according to the report produced jointly by the United Nations Children s Fund UNICEF
  and the WHO, the first to look specifically at provision in schools. It found nearly
  a third of primary and secondary schools lacked a safe and reliable drinking water
  supply, affecting nearly 570 million children. Nearly 20 per cent of schools had
  no safe drinking water at all. Just over a third of schools lacked adequate toilet
  facilities, affecting more than 620 million children. Almost one in five primary
  schools and one in eight secondary schools were considered to have no sanitation.
  Nearly half lacked proper handwashing facilities, essential for helping prevent
  the spread of infections and disease. Nearly 900 million children were affected,
  the report found. Sub-Saharan Africa, East and Southeast Asia had some of the worst
  facilities.  It s deeply shocking,  Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of charity
  WaterAid, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The consequences are very broad
  in terms of children s access to education, general health and state of nutrition.  Adolescent
  girls in particular are often forced to miss classes when they are on their periods
  if there are no proper cleaning and sanitation facilities, he said. More than a
  third of girls in South Asia miss school during their periods, often because they
  lack access to toilets or pads, according to a WaterAid and UNICEF study earlier
  this year. The World Bank last year warned countries needed to quadruple spending
  to $150 billion a year to deliver universal safe water and sanitation. However,
  experts say they are optimistic the situation can be quickly improved if leaders
  treat water, sanitation and hygiene as a priority.  With political will, it really
  is possible to deliver good quality services,  said Johnston. '

  90 s, a pair that mastered and lifted the art of reverse swing to uncatchable heights.
  One broke feet with his much feared toe-crushers while the other terrorised batsmen
  with his swinging bouncers. They hunted best in pairs and destroyed lineups regardless
  of conditions and oppositions.Their love for the game and bonding together grew
  with every falling wicket, but somehow this happy union was hurt by someone s envious
  wish and the love affair went sour.Who can forget their all conquering smile pose
  during the 92 English tour where they cemented a clear domination over Graham Gooch
  s men. But the very next year sowed the foundation of the great divide amongst the
  two most lethal quickies of modern era.Jawed Miandad was stripped off captaincy
  after the failure of Down Under and Wasim was installed in his place. However, just
  after one series into captaincy against the West Indies, players complained off
  Wasim authoritative behavior and Waqar pulled off a mutiny that included some big
  names in the team. Akram had to resign and Salim Malik was installed as the compromise
  captain.From then onwards, the breach could never be healed and the Demon of Mistrust
  kept rising its ugly face time to time. Friendship amongst the two was all but buried
  and the desire for revenge brewed with every possible opportunity.           Big
  year   Big Fights1999 was the eventful year when differences between the two were
  elevated to the next level. They were hardly at talking terms during the short tour
  of India and poor Inzi had to run around playing the courier guy. But it was the
  World Cup in England where Wasim actually got to test Waqar s nerves.Despite all
  of Wasim s tactics, Waqar somehow did find a place in the touring squad but remained
  mostly on the bench. The fire spitting Shoaib Akthar was at his fiercely best and
  that gave Wasim a good reason to curb his role to a water boy. Waqar only featured
  in the fateful game against Bangladesh while Wasim s dream of walking high like
  Imran Khan were shattered by Kangaroos in the finals.The rivalry resurfaced again
  in the later part of the year when Pakistan faced Australians in their backyard.

language: en
publisher: Geo News
summary: null
tags:
- world
text: 'Iran s legal challenge against renewed sanctions by the United States goes
  before the UN s International Court of Justice on Monday.  Here are four key questions
  regarding the case: What is the case about? Iran s attempt to block the reinstatement
  of sanctions, announced by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, is the latest
  in a series of court battles that Tehran and Washington are fighting at the ICJ.  Trump
  announced on May 8 that he was pulling out of a landmark deal between Iran and major
  powers aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The deal agreed
  with the UN s five permanent Security Council members and Germany in 2015 limits
  Tehran s stockpile of enriched uranium until 2031 in exchange for sanctions relief.
  Blasting the accord as a "horrible, one-sided deal", Trump reimposed a wave of tough,
  unilateral sanctions. Tehran now accuses Washington of "besieging" its economy and
  wants the Hague-based court   which rules in disputes between countries   to order
  the US to temporarily halt punitive measures, while the judges mull the deeper merits
  of the case. Does Tehran have a case? The case has two elements, said Eric De Brabandere,
  professor of international dispute settlement at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
  Firstly, "Iran genuinely considers the re-imposition of sanctions a violation of
  international law." Secondly, "Iran has the support of many European states on the
  question of sanctions, politically speaking," De Brabandere argued. Iran s representatives
  need to convince the ICJ that its 15 permanent judges indeed have the jurisdiction
  to hear the case. Tehran bases its arguments on a little-known 1955 treaty between
  Iran and the United States. The treaty provides for "friendly relations" between
  the two countries, encourages mutual trade and investment and regulates consular
  relations. However, there have been no formal diplomatic ties between Tehran and
  Washington since the regime of the US-backed Shah was deposed by Iran''s revolution
  in 1979. What will Washington argue? "My guess is that for this case they will argue
  that the court has no jurisdiction, as they did in a separate case launched against
  the US two years ago," said De Brabandere. Washington could invoke two arguments.
  One is that the 1955 treaty is no longer in force, because it is a "treaty of friendship"
  between two nations which have been adversaries for the last four decades. Secondly,
  US representatives could say that the dispute was "not about the treaty, but about
  sanctions and Iran s alleged terrorist activities," De Brabandere said. "The US
  is likely to argue that the dispute is about something much broader than a treaty,"
  for instance Tehran s nuclear ambitions, the expert said. Furthermore, there is
  a clause in the 1955 treaty which allows the states to take "any measures to protect
  essential security interests." Can Iran s case succeed? "I think it s very likely
  that the ICJ will, based on the 1955 treaty, decide to hear the case," said De Brabandere.
  However, whether the case will be successful on its own merits -- in other words
  whether the United States indeed breached its obligations -- is more difficult to
  establish. "For one, the 1955 treaty is relatively narrow in scope. It means that
  the ICJ can only rule whether the US violated its obligations under the specific
  treaty," De Brabandere said. This means that the ICJ s judges will not rule in what
  they may consider any broader dispute between Iran and the United States. The outcome
  of the case   which could still take years before being handed down   "is very difficult
  to predict," said De Brabandere. '

text: 'THE HAGUE: Iran will argue Monday against renewed sanctions imposed by the
  United States, as a bitter legal battle between Tehran and Washington opens before
  the UN s top court. US President Donald Trump reimposed a wave of tough unilateral
  sanctions on Iran three weeks ago, bringing back into effect harsh penalties that
  had been lifted under a landmark 2015 agreement. A second round of measures is to
  come into effect in early November, targeting Iran s valuable oil and energy sector.
  Tehran filed its case before the International Court of Justice in late July, calling
  on the Hague-based tribunal s judges to order the immediate lifting of sanctions,
  which it said would cause "irreparable prejudice." The US had no right to reinstate
  such measures, Tehran added, as it demanded compensation for damages. Iran maintained
  restoring the penalties lifted under the historic 2015 deal, aimed at curbing Tehran
  s nuclear ambitions, violated a decades-old treaty signed between the two nations
  in 1955. The ICJ -- set up in 1946 to rule in disputes between countries -- is expected
  to take a couple of months to decide whether to grant Tehran s request for a provisional
  ruling, while a final decision in the case may actually still take years. Trump
  described the 2015 deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the United
  Nations Security Council, as well as Germany, as a "horrible one-sided deal (that)
  failed to achieve the fundamental objective of blocking all paths to a Iranian nuclear
  bomb." Even though all of the other parties pleaded with him not to abandon the
  pact, Trump pulled out and announced he would reinstate sanctions.  Neither war,
  nor negotiations  Tehran -- which argues that the move violates the little-known
  1955 Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations -- says that the new sanctions are already
  hurting its economy. Iran s currency the rial has lost around half its value since
  April. A raft of international companies -- including France s Total, Peugeot and
  Renault, and Germany s Siemens and Daimler -- have suspended operations in Iran
  in the wake of the move. Both Air France and British Airways announced Thursday
  they were halt flights to Tehran next month, saying they were not commercially viable,
  but the British carrier added the decision was unrelated to the new tranche of sanctions.
  In his executive order, Trump argued that the sanctions would turn up the financial
  pressure on Tehran to come to a "comprehensive and lasting solution" regarding activities
  that the international community regarded as "malign" such as Iran s "ballistic
  missile programme and its support for terrorism." Earlier this month, Iran s supreme
  leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to rule out any immediate prospect of talks,
  saying "there will be neither war, nor negotiations," with the US. Washington s
  lawyers will present their case on Tuesday, with experts believing they are to challenge
  the ICJ s jurisdiction. '

text: 'Many European Union member states have failed the migrant victims of torture
  and trauma by not having systems in place to recognise the ordeals they have suffered,
  and support them on arrival. Such trauma if left untreated can scar them and their
  families for life, and may lead to suicide. These are some of the findings from
  the latest summary report of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) on migration-related
  fundamental rights concerns in select EU member states. It examines how victims
  are being handled by national authorities to highlight how to best offer them the
  protection they are entitled to. Many migrants and asylum seekers have fled or experienced
  extreme suffering in their home countries or en route to Europe. This includes physical
  and psychological violence, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. Lengthy bureaucracy,
  uncertainty about the outcome of asylum proceedings and poor reception conditions
  can compound their suffering. In Denmark alone, there were 120 suicide attempts
  and incidents of suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in 2016, of which 29 were
  by children. Despite international and EU laws guarding against such treatment offering
  support to victims, many member states are falling short of their duties, the report
  shows. Some of the report s main findings include:  1. The true extent of suffering
  is hard to gauge as only limited data on the victims of torture and trauma and on
  suicide attempts is collected in the 13 member states studied. Only Greece regularly
  collects information on torture victims.  2.  Recurrent violence or the excessive
  use of force by state officials or those working on their behalf was not found although
  there were cases of individual and localised incidents. However, serious incidents
  are more frequent along EU external border zones.  3.  Identifying victims is problematic
  given the lack of formal screening procedures. Instead countries heavily rely on
  the expertise and knowledge of individual staff, although tools are increasingly
  being developed to facilitate identification by non-experts.   4.  Access to support
  is limited by the number of specialised medical staff who can provide psychological
  or psychiatric help. The lack of staff often leads to long waiting periods; for
  example, in Germany around 5,600 asylum seekers waited over a year to receive treatment.
  It is also a challenge starting therapy when asylum applicants are homeless or live
  in reception facilities that are not adequate to sustain the therapy.   5.  Despite
  training, monitoring bodies and complaints mechanisms in all member states, their
  effectiveness in preventing ill-treatment varies from country to country. Despite
  the lack of attention to torture and trauma victims, the report also identifies
  promising practices that other member states could adopt to identify and support
  victims. The European Commission asked the Agency for Fundamental Rights to collect
  data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in member states,
  particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 member
  states: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy,
  the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. '

text: 'KARACHI: The Federal Government and provinces are neither serious about nor
  taking an interest in holding population and housing census in the country. It s
  a legal obligation imposed on the Federal Government in the Federal Legislative
  list of fourth schedule to the Constitution; nevertheless, hurdles are being created
  to delay or stop the sixth census in Pakistan, as mentioned in Aam log Ittehad Petition
  filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. According to Petitioner Justice (retd) Wajihuddin
  Ahmed, Acting Chairman Aam Loeg Ittehad:  While the first four censuses were more
  or less regularly and duly held in the years 1951, 1961, 1972 and 1981, the fifth
  census was undertaken in 1998 after 17 years, an inordinate delay of 7 years which
  was certainly avoidable. That is not to say that the pervious censuses were problem
  free.  However, we are now in the 21st century and living in the Information Age,
  with little or no scope for such aberrations.  Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed said in
  a separate statement:  None of the governments are serious in the matter, though
  for different reasons. The Federal Government is engaged in a mechanical exercise,
  solely because it has to honor its undertaking before the apex court. The sardars
  and Khans of Balochistan and KP feel threatened that once their impecunious and
  burgeoning populations are quantified, their own lavish and luxurious lifestyles
  would come under scrutiny. The Sindh government, which exclusively represents rural
  Sindh, is determined to inflate the numbers in rural areas and decimate those in
  urban Sindh.  Justice Wajih further said that the census is an activity necessary
  to assess the needs on the basis of population, and this act will be beneficial
  for human rights. The petition points out that the leadership of Punjab is no wiser.
  It is fully aware that the proportion of their population is slowly declining and
  if census is held it would no longer be officially reflected as being 55.63% of
  the population of Pakistan. The estimated Punjab population, as per the 2011 Housing
  Census, is 47.69%. In the previous census of 1998, while a slower per annum growth
  rate of 2.64% in Punjab was recorded, Sindh registered a growth rate of 2.80% per
  annum. The petition further states that if this trend continues, it is bound to
  have a negative impact on the 148 National Assembly seats allocated to the province
  of Punjab under the Constitution. In order to maintain and ensure the numerical
  majority of the province of Punjab in the population census of Pakistan, some functionaries
  of the Punjab government are keen to have the exercise of the forthcoming census
  abandoned. The notables of Punjab need to realise that if the present population
  ratio of their province is unrealistically maintained and reflected to be higher
  than it actually is, history may repeat itself. In similar circumstances, the former
  province of East Pakistan, having a 54% share of the total population, seceded,
  not the least for the reason that the former province of West Pakistan was not in
  favour of the idea of remaining a permanent minority province, says the petition.
  The petition notes that the situation is particularly sensitive in Sindh because
  at this eleventh hour the government is proactively pursuing the issuance of CNICs
  in rural areas. It is no secret that the government of Sindh only and exclusively
  represents rural Sindh, with a predictable tilt in that direction. Its unchecked
  participation in the census exercise, which, as stated in the preceding paragraph,
  is a Federal subject/entry, occurring in Part II of the Federal Legislative List,
  controlled by Articles 153(4) and 154 (1) (6) ), is likely to produce unacceptable
  results. Aam Loeg Ittehad petition states that there is hue and cry in Balochistan
  that if the current census, in the present situation, is carried out the Baloch
  people shall be relegated to being a minority in their own province. Nothing can
  be farther from the truth. The Baloch people, who are purported to have moved to
  Sindh and Punjab, can easily be counted at their present places of residence.  And
  if some Afghan refugees, in Balochistan, now possess Pakistan CNICs, they can always
  be carefully screened and excluded from the head count of the forthcoming population
  census. Thereafter, their illegal Pakistan CNICs can be replaced by other distinctive
  cards of identification. Much the same is the position in KP, where provincial leaders
  have shown apprehension that if some migrants from Afghanistan, who are unlawfully
  holding Pakistan CNICs, are counted, as part of the population, the Pashtuns would
  be converted into a minority. That also is as illogical a position as taken by the
  Baloch sardars. For one thing, an inflated KP population would bring similar benefits,
  as in the case of Balochistan and in any case the electoral process would remain
  unaffected, as in the case of Balochistan, states the petition. It has been requested
  of the Honorable Court to direct the Federal Government to assume full jurisdiction
  in the matter of the forthcoming census and provide directions and guidance to the
  Council of Common Interests, as and when necessary. The Court has also been appealed
  to direct the Federal and Provincial Governments of Pakistan to ensure full, complete
  and absolute compliance of law and the Constitution in the matter of the forthcoming
  census. Census is not just for the head-count of Pakistani citizens (CNIC holders)
  but of all persons in Pakistan who must be counted on the basis of due and verifiable
  particulars and only after securing due clarification of valid CNIC holders. The
  petition has further requested the Court to issue directions to NADRA, through the
  Chair NADRA to cancel all illegal CNICs and, where needed, to issue other cards/insignias
  for identification of persons holding illegal CNICs. And also to prohibit NADRA
  from issuing new CNICs at least one month prior to the start of the first phase
  of the census. It has also been requested that the Court prohibit all Provincial
  Governments from any and all direct or indirect interaction with the census functionaries,
  and to ensure that no census result is announced until the Armed Forces  component
  of the census personnel expressly approves it. '

text: 'United Nations investigators on Monday called for an international probe and
  prosecution of Myanmar''s army chief and five other top military commanders for
  genocide against the country''s Rohingya minority.  "Myanmar''s top military generals,
  including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated
  and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes
  against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States," a UN-backed
  fact-finding mission said. Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled northern Rakhine state
  to Bangladesh after Myanmar launched a brutal crackdown last August on insurgents
  amid accounts of arson, murder and rape at the hands of soldiers and vigilante mobs
  in the mainly Buddhist country. Myanmar has vehemently denied allegations of ethnic
  cleansing, insisting it was responding to attacks by Rohingya rebels.  But in Monday
  s report, the UN mission insisted the army tactics had been "consistently and grossly
  disproportionate to actual security threats." The mission, which was created by
  the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017, concluded in a report that "there is
  sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials
  in the Tatmadaw (Myanmar army) chain of command." "The crimes in Rakhine State,
  and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and
  scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,"
  the report said. The investigators named Min Aung Hlaing and five other top military
  commanders, adding that a longer list of names could be shared with "any competent
  and credible body pursuing accountability in line with international norms and standards."
  Criticism was also directed at Myanmar s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel
  Peace Prize laureate who has been the target of global vitriol for a perceived failure
  to stand up for the stateless minority. The report found that she had "not used
  her de facto position as head of government, nor her moral authority, to stem or
  prevent the unfolding events."  While acknowledging that she and other civilian
  authorities had little influence on military actions, it said that they "through
  their acts and omissions... have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes."
  The investigators called on the UN Security Council to refer the Myanmar situation
  to the International Criminal Court, or for an ad hoc international criminal tribunal
  to be created. They also recommended an arms embargo and "targeted individual sanctions
  against those who appear to be most responsible." '

text: "LONDON: Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) branch of the\
  \ Pakistan Army, Major General Asim Bajwa addressed the Royal United Services Institute\
  \ (RUSI), a leading think tank in London on Thursday. The DG ISPR, spoke on the\
  \ role of the Pakistan Army in countering terrorism, rendering great sacrifices.\
  \ He explained how the army freed areas from Taliban control adding that the strategic\
  \ objective was to deny them use of Pakistan\u2019s territory to achieve lasting\
  \ peace.Bajwa told the think tank in his address, that with the aim of eliminating\
  \ terrorism and ending militant links in the area to establish the writ of the state\
  \ and to improve governance in the area, the army began its operation from the North\
  \ in Bajaur agency and made its way down. He recalled how Swat was taken over by\
  \ terrorists and how the army went in to eliminate them after the Tehrik-e-Taliban\
  \ Pakistan (TTP) began flogging people meting out their brand of justice. The operation\
  \ was lauded by the United Nations as the most successful operation. Zarb-e-AzbBajwa\
  \ shared, that the government made efforts to negotiate with the terrorists to address\
  \ the matter through dialogue, but that didn't help. Then the terrorists attacked\
  \ one of the country\u2019s major airports in Karachi which was a defining point\
  \ to launch Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Prior to the launch of operation Zarb-e-Azb, Bajwa\
  \ added, the Army Chief issued clear instructions that the operation will be against\
  \ terrorists of all hues and colour without any discrimination. That collateral\
  \ damage must be avoided even at the cost of delayed progress in the operation and\
  \ that no human rights violations should take place. He explained that Operation\
  \ Zarb-e-Azb is not an end in itself, it is a national effort involving all segments\
  \ of Pakistani society determined to root out terrorism from Pakistan and it aims\
  \ at restoring the writ of the government through use of military intervention,\
  \ destroying safe-havens and terrorist hideouts, eliminating all kinds of terrorists.Bajwa\
  \ shared, that Operation Zarb-e-Azb is continuing successfully. As a result over\
  \ 2000 terrorists have been killed in North Waziristan and elsewhere, he added that\
  \ the price being paid is also high, over 200 soldiers have laid down their lives\
  \ and nearly 800 have been injured. Bajwa added, that the Army has dismantled the\
  \ terror economy, their funding sources need to be choked he added that their finances\
  \ must be choked to end the reign of terror. Situation in North WaziristanBajwa\
  \ explained that the Taliban were using safe havens in North Waziristan to operate,\
  \ they had communication systems, were manufacturing bombs and explosive material\
  \ for their nefarious terror objectives. Border CrossingDue to Pakistan\u2019s porous\
  \ borders, Bajwa said, the Taliban were able to cross over to Afghanistan due to\
  \ their existing links. He added, that ISAF and the Afghan security forces were\
  \ informed well before the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb about the border-crossing\
  \ and in some cases they met with success while in others they are still struggling.\
  \ Khyber AgencyThe DG ISPR explains that the Army went into Khyber Agency to clear\
  \ the area and to sever links that the terrorists were trying to reestablish, adding\
  \ that they met with success due to good cooperation with the Afghan and ISAF forces.\
  \ Bajwa added, that when forces went in, they discovered that the terrorists were\
  \ very well equipped and would have been able to cause great damage. Rehabilitation\
  \ InitiativesBajwa told the think tank, that Pakistan has started various social\
  \ economic development projects within the tribal areas to bring dividends to the\
  \ locals through trade and economic development, adding that a general trade corridor\
  \ has been created to expedite trade.Pakistan is addressing the root causes of the\
  \ problem and is initiating projects in fields of education, rehabilitating schools,\
  \ reviewing the curriculum and enabling young girls to attend schools.Bajwa said,\
  \ Pakistan is grateful to its friends from across the world, the donors who are\
  \ helping our efforts, their help is much appreciated, adding that a comprehensive\
  \ plan is in place to look after the IDP\u2019s and rehabilitate them as soon as\
  \ possible which includes cooperation with all relevant civilian agencies.  Border\
  \ IssuesOn the issue of Pakistan\u2019s porous border, Bajwa explained, that it\
  \ was difficult to seal the Eastern border with Afghanistan and the border with\
  \ Iran, adding that was a big challenge. He added that Pakistan has a 3000 km Eastern\
  \ border with India and others. He shared that Pakistan\u2019s neighbours keep hurling\
  \ allegations. He said border violations from India are distracting Pakistan from\
  \ the task we have on the western side, we have shown lots of restraint. Pakistan\
  \ has been offering peace while India has shown arrogance. They cancelled secretary\
  \ level talks, accused Pakistan wrongly adding that there is a method to their madness.\
  \ They are trying to distract our attention, while we want peace and we have offered\
  \ it many times. He said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has gone to great lengths.\
  \ He met Narendra Modi and our foreign office went out of the way, we offered DG\
  \ level talks. It helped to some extent, but what do you do when there is military\
  \ violation and then they blame Pakistan instead \u2013 that doesn\u2019t help,\
  \ he added. Bajwa said, things are right there for everyone to see adding that Pakistan\
  \ expects everyone to play their role to bring peace. India needs to understand,\
  \ that Pakistan is not oblivious to what is happening in India. There is the festering\
  \ wound of the unresolved issue of Kashmir, it is one of the major issues n the\
  \ way of peace between India and Pakistan. BalochistanOn the issue of Balochistan,\
  \ the DG ISPR explained that it is a national problem and that Pakistan has been\
  \ raising the issue of external interference at every level. He said, the porous\
  \ nature of the border hinders full control of the state adding that Baloch militants\
  \ have links and bases inside Afghanistan where Ferrari camps are present. He explained\
  \ that militancy of this nature cannot sustain without external influence for long\
  \ without financing from abroad and that much of it was taking place as a result\
  \ of foreign help but said he did not want to name any country. Military CourtsOn\
  \ the issue of military courts, Bajwa said, that the entire justice system has not\
  \ come under military domain, explaining that military courts are a stop gap arrangement\
  \ due to the existing capacity issue of Pakistan\u2019s judicial system. He clarified\
  \ that military courts will only deal with terrorists. Madrasa ReformsThe decision\
  \ to reform madrasa\u2019s has been taken against those seminaries that abet and\
  \ facilitate terrorists or those who sympathize with terrorists. He added, that\
  \ warrants against Maulana Aziz (the Lal Masjid cleric) have been issued and that\
  \ it was only a matter of execution now. He said, the government has taken its decision\
  \ against terrorism adding that everything does not happen overnight. The government\
  \ is serious about dealing with anyone who sympathizes with or promotes terrorism\
  \ in any form, he added."

text: 'JAKARTA: China s Su Bingtian was crowned Asia s fastest man on Sunday, justifying
  the hype surrounding him by winning the blue riband 100 metres sprint gold in an
  Asian Games record time.  Su became the first Asian-born sprinter to run the distance
  in under 10 seconds in June when he clocked 9.91 twice in the space of eight days,
  matching the Asian record held by Qatar s Nigerian-born Femi Ogunode. On Sunday,
  he held off his opponents with a late burst of speed to win the event in 9.92 seconds,
  ahead of Nigerian-born Qatari Tosin Ogunode, who clocked 10.00, on a hot and humid
  night in the Indonesian capital.  It wasn t about the time, it was about getting
  the win,  Su, 28, told reporters.  I knew that if I got a good start then I can
  t be beaten.  Japan s Ryota Yamagata was credited with the same time as Ogunode
  and won bronze. Indonesian teenager Lalu Muhammad Zohri ran a personal best of 10.20
  but it was good enough for only seventh spot. The crowd at the Gelora Bung Karno
  Stadium was in for a surprise in the women s 100m final when Nigerian-born Edidiong
  Odiong of Bahrain was adjudged the winner in a photo-finish over India s Dutee Chand,
  who lost her lead in the last few metres. The 21-year-old Odiong clocked 11.30 to
  be crowned Asia s fastest woman. Chand was cleared to race in 2015 following a Court
  of Arbitration for Sport ruling on gender testing guidelines. The Lausanne-based
  court suspended the governing International Association of Athletics Federations  regulations
  regarding hyperandrogenism, a condition which produces high testosterone levels
  allowing Chand to compete again after a year sat out. Pre-race favourite Wei Yongli
  of China, who recently became the first Asian woman to break the 11-second barrier,
  had topped the timings in Saturday s heats and also the semi-finals but had to be
  satisfied with a bronze. Sudan-born Abdalelah Hassan gave Qatar its first gold medal
  at the 18th Asian Games in the men s 400m, finishing ahead of India s Muhammed Anas
  in 44.89 seconds. Ali Khamis won the bronze for Bahrain. Salwa Naser maintained
  Bahrain s hold on the women s 400m, following in the footsteps of Kemi Adekoya,
  who won the event in Incheon, South Korea, four years ago. The Nigerian-born Naser,
  who won silver at the world championships last year, comfortably won in an Asian
  Games record time of 50.09. India s Hima Das, the under-20 world champion, won silver
  while Elina Mikhina claimed bronze for Kazakhstan. Women s shot put world champion
  Gong Lijiao and Gao Yang made it a one-two for China although Gong s distance of
  19.66m was over two metres more than her compatriot. China has now won gold in the
  women s shot put at each of the last 11 Asian Games, dating back to 1978. China
  also took the top two positions in the men s long jump when Wang Jianan and Zhang
  Yaoguang won the gold and silver medals respectively. Bahrain also had their one-two
  moment on the night when Moroccan-born Hassan Chani and Kenyan-born Abraham Cheroben
  won the gold and silver respectively in the men s 10,000m. India s Govindan Lakshmanan
  won the bronze but was later disqualified for stepping off the track during the
  race. Jung Hye-lim won the women s 100m hurdles to give South Korea their first
  Asiad gold in athletics in eight years. Silver medallist Emilia Nova became the
  first Indonesian woman to win a track medal since Supriati Sutono s 5000m gold in
  1998.  This silver medal means a lot. Two weeks ago my hip flexor hurt but the past
  week I managed the pain. Because of the Asian Games, I just ignored the pain,  Nova
  said. '

  by admin staff. Reached for comment, hostel administration declined the request.
  Police said the hostels will not be reopened until adequate security arrangements
  are made. The situation also perplexed the parents of the students, who questioned
  where would their children go at this hour of night. The students, outside the hostels,
  were found calling their relatives and friends in Lahore in search of a temporary
  place to stay at. No institute asked to get hostels vacated: DIG On the other hand,
  DIG Operations Lahore Haider Ashraf denied that the police asked NCA administration
  to get the hostels vacated. "We have not asked administration of any educational
  institution to get its hostels vacated," Ashraf said, adding that police were providing
  foolproof security to all institutes. '

  \ press briefing regarding details of the Army Public School investigation, the\
  \ same group stuck again, in the same unfortunate city of Peshawar. The Pakistani\
  \ Taliban\u2019s central group headed by Mullah Fazlullah claimed the responsibility\
  \ in a video message. In a 4 minute and 12 second long video the Tehreek-e-Taliban\
  \ Pakistan (TTP) commander, Umar Mansoor \u2013 flanked by the three suicide-bombers\
  \ \u2013 claimed the Imamia Mosque attack. According to details, the three suicide\
  \ bombers entered the mosque from the back as worshipers were offering Asar prayers.\
  \ Initially the attackers threw hand-grenades followed by an AK-47 assault. In the\
  \ mean time few private guards stationed at the mosque retaliated, but two suicide\
  \ bombers managed to sneak into the main hall of the mosque and blew themselves\
  \ up; while one suicide-bomber was shot dead by private guards in the courtyard\
  \ of the mosque. The similarities between the Imamia Mosque attack and Army Public\
  \ School [APS] carnage are undeniable. Last year on December 16, terrorists stormed\
  \ the Army Public School (APS) and brutally massacred 145 people including 132 school\
  \ children. Speaking to Geo News, Assistant Inspector General of KP police and the\

  \ 16, attackers had reached the school in a van and destroyed it by setting it alight\
  \ before entering the school premises.In the APS assault, the terrorists used Russian\
  \ made hand grenades and the same type of grenades were recovered from the Imamia\
  \ Mosque, Hayatabad. In both the attacks, the terrorists used a dual-trigger mechanism\
  \ for their bombs, Malik confirmed to Geo News. \u201CPolice has found the heads\

text: 'The equation for Pakistan is crystal clear, defeat the South Africans or go
  pack your bags. As the World Cup pool stage approaches its pointy end, both teams
  would look to pocket the all important 2 points, but for different reasons. South
  Africa, for a jab at the top slot, for Pakistan it s a question of survival.While
  fans would love to watch leather bang hard on willow, there are good chances that
  mother nature might step in at Auckland and spoil the fun with possible thundering
  showers.As the big hitters from both sides adjust their grips and the quickies tighten
  their spikes for the cut-through fixture, how about getting a bit nostalgic and
  re-collect some golden moments from days gone by?The Protease and Green shirts have
  fought their battles hard and given fans some memorable treats to cherish. From
  the first time they locked horns at the 92 Cup till the last arm-lock in Centurion,
  it s been all about pure passion, challenge and hunger for success. Keeping such
  history in mind, both teams are expected to produce a lot of bang and smoke on Saturday.Let
  s revisit some moments that refuse to leave our collections.1. Jhonty steals Inzi
  and the three Stumps   Crickets Superman hits the groundWe have all seen it hundreds
  of times and still never get tired of it, probably the most spectacular moment from
  a cricket field. The iconic image of the airborne Jhonty, horizontal to the last
  limb, flying through the air and defying laws of gravity to demolish all three stumps.
  A mind boggling stunt that would make even the legendary Christopher Reeve bite
  his fingers.The magical moment was captured by famed cricket photographer Patrick
  Eager and became a part of the games folklore. Jhonty recognition before the run
  out was limited to that of a struggling middle order batsman who wasn t contributing
  enough runs but would save 20 odd runs in fielding. But that one picture changed
  his existence.Ask him today and Jhonty is still unsure if it was his leap against
  gravity or the click of the camera that made him the poster boy of World Cricket.2.
  Waqar Younis 4-62 at Sharjah Cup Final   The return of the wounded TigerWhat a match
  for fans, what a match for Pakistan and what a match for Waqar Younis it was. Being
  thrashed by Australia in the tour Down under, Wasim Akram was dethroned from Captaincy
  and Pakistan came to play the Sharjah Cup under a new leader, Moin Khan.Waqar was
  kept on the side lines by Wasim and it was his time to hit back. Although he had
  a rocking tournament, but the Burewala Express kept his best for the finals against
  the mighty South Africans. Defending a total of 263, Waqar s middle order burst
  kept a check on the Protease and gave Moin Khan his first tournament win as a captain.And
  not to forget from the same match was Inzaman s cracking off drive that nearly blew
  Nantie Haywards head.3. Afridi s Flying Kiss to Jacque Kallis   Kallis Chaumma DedeAs
  the old saying goes, you can expect anything from Shahid Afridi, but here was an
  act as bizarre as it can get. It was the Semifinal of the T-20 WC at Nottingham,
  Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat. The last ball of the 4th over, Afridi
  wacked a short one from Kallis over wide midwicket for four.It was one of the hundreds
  of boundaries Afridi struck in his career, but what he did next caught every one
  off guard and astonished Kallis. Out of the blue, Afridi blew him a kiss but Kallis
  wasn t thrilled. This was tempting food for TV channels who did not miss a chance
  to milk out ratings. The foot tapping Amitabh hit  Jumma Chaumma Dede  blended perfectly
  and also generated thousand of hits on YouTube.4. Abdul Razzaq s rampant century
  at Abu DhabiPakistan had lost the first match and badly needed a win to bounce back
  in the series. Same was the case with Razzaq who was ping ponged in and out of the
  team. Chasing a target of 286, Pakistan were bruised at 5-136 when Razzaq took guard.
  It was the perfect setting for Razzaq who grabbed the opportunity with both hands
  and showered a 72 ball 109 that included 10 sixes and 7 fours. In his own words,
  this was the most memorable and fighting innings he ever played.5.Fanie de Villiers
  Cycling joy and Hansie Cronje s Tanga jockey funWe have all seem them; we have all
  lived through them. Pakistan has seen much better days then the ones currently flashed
  to the world. Foreign teams used to visit Pakistan multiple times every year, they
  used to play hard and rubbishing aside the cultural shock syndrome, used to merge
  and enjoy the tastes of Pakistan s rich and colorful culture. Every time Pakistan
  play their home series in UAE, the images of Fanie de Villiers enjoying his cycle
  ride in Faisalabad s Famous  Ghanta Ghar Chowk , or the Late Hansie Cronje hacking
  the Tanga at Rawalpindi s  Raja Bazar , remind of the golden days of Pakistan Cricket.
  The smile of their faces tells the complete story, how secure and welcomed they
  felt in the land of pure.Only South Africa can fell Pakistan s pain, they themselves
  suffered international isolation for 27 years and went through the painful apartheid
  segregation. Only they can realize the agony behind empty stands and dusty grounds.
  They have helped us before, they could again stretch their hands and allow Pakistani
  fans to make some noise in those empty stands.                                                         '

  \ killing of Saifullah Kurd on Sunday in Quetta.Mohammad Usman alias Saifullah Kurd\
  \ was chief of the banned LeJ\u2019s Balochistan chapter and was the most wanted\
  \ terrorist in the province. The provincial government had announced a reward or\
  \ \u2018head money\u2019 of Rs. 2.5 million. Speaking to Geo News the Quetta Police\
  \ Chief Abdul Razzaq Cheema confirmed his death. A top security source disclosed\
  \ that, Kurd\u2019s aide was also neutralized during the operation. \u201CAn identity\
  \ card was recovered from his pocket bearing the name Ghulam Sarwar, but his identity\
  \ is yet to be confirmed\u201D told the source. On an intelligence tip-off, a special\
  \ unit of the Frontier Corps Balochistan raided a hotel in Shaal Kot, Karachi Road\
  \ area of Saryab. In the exchange of fire that followed between terrorists and the\
  \ law enforcers Saifullah Kurd was gunned down along with his accomplice. One law\
  \ enforcer embraced martyrdom while 4 others were injured. Weapons and mobile phones\
  \ were also recovered from Kurd\u2019s possession. Intelligence sources revealed,\
  \ that Kurd was a known terrorist and the mastermind of all major sectarian attacks\
  \ in Balochistan specially in the provincial capital, Quetta. \u201CWhether it was\
  \ an assault on busses carrying pilgrims or the genocide of hundreds of Shia Hazara\
  \ in the Alamdar Road and Hazara Town blasts; being a planner he had become a symbol\
  \ of the reign of terror in the province\u201D, the intelligence source revealed.\
  \ Kurd was apprehended once before, but managed to escape from a high security prison.\
  \ He was apprehended by an intelligence agency along with the Sindh CID in December\
  \ 2005 from Cattle colony in Karachi. After his arrest from the metropolis, he was\
  \ shifted to Quetta where he was kept at the Anti Terrorist Force\u2019s high security\
  \ prison inside Quetta Cantonment. Astonishingly in 2008, he escaped from the fortified\
  \ prison and remained at large till Sunday, when he was killed.According to his\
  \ interrogation report, seen by this scribe, Kurd was one of 8 siblings born to\
  \ Noor Mohammad who hailed from a poor background. At the young age of 15, he began\
  \ driving an oil tanker and later joined Dawood Badini another oil tanker driver.\
  \ Badini\u2019s father was Mulana Ameer Hamza Badini, the leader of the proscribed\
  \ Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan \u2013 renamed as Ahle Sunnat Wal Jammat (ASWJ). Badini\
  \ is the nephew of al-Qaeda\u2019s former operational commander and No. 3, Khalid\
  \ Sheikh Mohammad. He is also the brother-in-law of Ramzi Yousaf, who executed the\
  \ first terror attack in the United States in 1993 at the World Trade Center in\
  \ New York. Saifullah Kurd began visiting gatherings hosted by Badini\u2019s father,\
  \ Ameer Hamza and under his influence joined the proscribed Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan.\
  \ In 1998, Saifullah Kurd first met with Riaz Basra, the founder of banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi\
  \ in Kabul, Afghanistan. A recently executed terrorist Shabbir aka Doctor was also\
  \ present during the meeting. It was in Afghanistan that Kurd received 20-days of\
  \ training at the Khalid Bin Waleed training camp run by banned Harkat-ul-Mujahideen,\
  \ where he was trained on how to use pistols and AK-47 assault rifles by his trainer,\
  \ Ustad Usama.Kurd stayed in Afghanistan for a month and returned to Quetta via\
  \ Kabul, Khandhar and Chaman. He carried out his first sectarian assault in October\

  \ Sardar Nisar Hazara. The minister and his bodyguard were injured while his driver\
  \ lost his life in the attack. For their direct involvement in terrorist attacks,\

text: "LONDON: Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) branch of the\
  \ Pakistan Army, Major General Asim Bajwa addressed the Royal United Services Institute\
  \ (RUSI), a leading think tank in London on Thursday. The DG ISPR, spoke on the\
  \ role of the Pakistan Army in countering terrorism, rendering great sacrifices.\
  \ He explained how the army freed areas from Taliban control adding that the strategic\
  \ objective was to deny them use of Pakistan\u2019s territory to achieve lasting\
  \ peace.Bajwa told the think tank in his address, that with the aim of eliminating\
  \ terrorism and ending militant links in the area to establish the writ of the state\
  \ and to improve governance in the area, the army began its operation from the North\
  \ in Bajaur agency and made its way down. He recalled how Swat was taken over by\
  \ terrorists and how the army went in to eliminate them after the Tehrik-e-Taliban\
  \ Pakistan (TTP) began flogging people meting out their brand of justice. The operation\
  \ was lauded by the United Nations as the most successful operation. Zarb-e-AzbBajwa\
  \ shared, that the government made efforts to negotiate with the terrorists to address\
  \ the matter through dialogue, but that didn't help. Then the terrorists attacked\
  \ one of the country\u2019s major airports in Karachi which was a defining point\
  \ to launch Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Prior to the launch of operation Zarb-e-Azb, Bajwa\
  \ added, the Army Chief issued clear instructions that the operation will be against\
  \ terrorists of all hues and colour without any discrimination. That collateral\
  \ damage must be avoided even at the cost of delayed progress in the operation and\
  \ that no human rights violations should take place. He explained that Operation\
  \ Zarb-e-Azb is not an end in itself, it is a national effort involving all segments\
  \ of Pakistani society determined to root out terrorism from Pakistan and it aims\
  \ at restoring the writ of the government through use of military intervention,\
  \ destroying safe-havens and terrorist hideouts, eliminating all kinds of terrorists.Bajwa\
  \ shared, that Operation Zarb-e-Azb is continuing successfully. As a result over\
  \ 2000 terrorists have been killed in North Waziristan and elsewhere, he added that\
  \ the price being paid is also high, over 200 soldiers have laid down their lives\
  \ and nearly 800 have been injured. Bajwa added, that the Army has dismantled the\
  \ terror economy, their funding sources need to be choked he added that their finances\
  \ must be choked to end the reign of terror. Situation in North WaziristanBajwa\
  \ explained that the Taliban were using safe havens in North Waziristan to operate,\
  \ they had communication systems, were manufacturing bombs and explosive material\
  \ for their nefarious terror objectives. Border CrossingDue to Pakistan\u2019s porous\
  \ borders, Bajwa said, the Taliban were able to cross over to Afghanistan due to\
  \ their existing links. He added, that ISAF and the Afghan security forces were\
  \ informed well before the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb about the border-crossing\
  \ and in some cases they met with success while in others they are still struggling.\
  \ Khyber AgencyThe DG ISPR explains that the Army went into Khyber Agency to clear\
  \ the area and to sever links that the terrorists were trying to reestablish, adding\
  \ that they met with success due to good cooperation with the Afghan and ISAF forces.\
  \ Bajwa added, that when forces went in, they discovered that the terrorists were\
  \ very well equipped and would have been able to cause great damage. Rehabilitation\
  \ InitiativesBajwa told the think tank, that Pakistan has started various social\
  \ economic development projects within the tribal areas to bring dividends to the\
  \ locals through trade and economic development, adding that a general trade corridor\
  \ has been created to expedite trade.Pakistan is addressing the root causes of the\
  \ problem and is initiating projects in fields of education, rehabilitating schools,\
  \ reviewing the curriculum and enabling young girls to attend schools.Bajwa said,\
  \ Pakistan is grateful to its friends from across the world, the donors who are\
  \ helping our efforts, their help is much appreciated, adding that a comprehensive\
  \ plan is in place to look after the IDP\u2019s and rehabilitate them as soon as\
  \ possible which includes cooperation with all relevant civilian agencies.  Border\
  \ IssuesOn the issue of Pakistan\u2019s porous border, Bajwa explained, that it\
  \ was difficult to seal the Eastern border with Afghanistan and the border with\
  \ Iran, adding that was a big challenge. He added that Pakistan has a 3000 km Eastern\

  \ the task we have on the western side, we have shown lots of restraint. Pakistan\
  \ has been offering peace while India has shown arrogance. They cancelled secretary\

  \ he added. Bajwa said, things are right there for everyone to see adding that Pakistan\
  \ expects everyone to play their role to bring peace. India needs to understand,\
  \ that Pakistan is not oblivious to what is happening in India. There is the festering\
  \ wound of the unresolved issue of Kashmir, it is one of the major issues n the\
  \ way of peace between India and Pakistan. BalochistanOn the issue of Balochistan,\
  \ the DG ISPR explained that it is a national problem and that Pakistan has been\
  \ raising the issue of external interference at every level. He said, the porous\
  \ nature of the border hinders full control of the state adding that Baloch militants\
  \ have links and bases inside Afghanistan where Ferrari camps are present. He explained\
  \ that militancy of this nature cannot sustain without external influence for long\
  \ without financing from abroad and that much of it was taking place as a result\
  \ of foreign help but said he did not want to name any country. Military CourtsOn\
  \ the issue of military courts, Bajwa said, that the entire justice system has not\
  \ come under military domain, explaining that military courts are a stop gap arrangement\
  \ due to the existing capacity issue of Pakistan\u2019s judicial system. He clarified\
  \ that military courts will only deal with terrorists. Madrasa ReformsThe decision\
  \ to reform madrasa\u2019s has been taken against those seminaries that abet and\
  \ facilitate terrorists or those who sympathize with terrorists. He added, that\
  \ warrants against Maulana Aziz (the Lal Masjid cleric) have been issued and that\

text: "To be part of a world cup squad remains the pinnacle in any player\u2019s career,\
  \ but to miss the berth is an agonizing pain that not only hurts deep inside, but\
  \ keeps resurging for times to come. While most of our favorite stars are trying\
  \ to acclimatize with the punishing Down-Under demands, here is a look at the few\
  \ who would be forced to watch the games on television and mediate over missed chances.\
  \ Readers might not be in total agreement with my selection and would chip in alternatives,\
  \ but I have a strong belief that the players mentioned are still match winners\
  \ on their day. If given a chance they would sweat enough to fit in national shirts.1-\
  \ Alastair Cook2014 wasn't a year Cook would keep in his memory; the former England\
  \ skipper could only manage 523 runs in 20 matches at a mediocre average of 27.52.\
  \ To add salt to his wounds, back to back defeats against India and then Sri-Lanka\
  \ cut loose his arm band. This double jolt of form and luck convinced the selectors\
  \ to put faith in the young and charismatic Eoin Morgan.2-Kamran AkmalThe elder\
  \ Akmal is probably the most interesting player of his times. While most teams would\
  \ gladly offer him the opening slot, handing him the keeper\u2019s gloves needs\
  \ a lion\u2019s heart. He has been missing from ODI action since June 2013 but that\
  \ would be of little concern as he carries bundles of experience tasting Australian\
  \ pitches and modern pacers. Initially part of Pakistan\u2019s 30 member Squad,\
  \ Karman lost his place and popularity to the young and fearless Sarfaraz.3-Kevin\
  \ PietersenProbably the most dominating and explosive cricketer of the modern era,\
  \ the past year has been tough for the fire-eating stroke maker. A poor avg of 29.40\
  \ during the Ashes down under made the selector\u2019s job easy. For a high maintenance\
  \ player like him, even a few low scores are enough to raise questions. Last wearing\
  \ the England shirt in September 2013, KP has been creating havoc in cricket leagues\
  \ around the world and specially the Big Bash.4-Yuvraj SinghThe True \u201CRock-Star\u201D\
  \ of International cricket and a heartthrob to millions, 2015 Would Cup will surely\
  \ miss the beloved Yuvi. The Hero of the previous edition failed to appear in any\
  \ ODI in 2014 and had an average stint in IPL. The lowest point came when Yuvi failed\
  \ to cut into initial 30. Regardless of this rusty performance, Yuvi is one player\
  \ who\u2019s spark shines at the highest level, a ticking bomb that can go off exactly\
  \ when needed. Dhoni\u2019s 11 would definitely miss a match winner in their ranks.5-Fawad\
  \ AlamFawad Alam is undoubted Pakistan\u2019s hidden gem and at the same time, their\
  \ Unsolved puzzle. Forced into oblivion for a good 3 years, Fawad burst into match\
  \ winning performances when given a chance at the Asia Cup. His sparkling come back\
  \ was a huge surprise, big enough only to be matched by his omission from the world\
  \ cup. Milking 345 runs from 8 matches at a healthy avg of 43, Fawad suddenly became\
  \ the darling of the nation. His Vadera looking mustache and sticking-in approach\
  \ fetched back the much needed stability in the waggling middle order. In a batting\
  \ line up that\u2019s always ready to choke, one can only hope that Pakistan made\
  \ the right decision by leaving out their Iron-Wall.6-Dwayne BravoA maverick all\
  \ rounder, Bravo is missing the world cup seat for reasons purely beyond the boundary.\
  \ West Indian players have had a long prevailing payment dispute with their board\
  \ and Bravo; along with Kevin Pollard were the latest to feel the heat. Bravo faced\
  \ the music for leading the revolt and was replaced by former skipper Darren Sammy.7-Ryan\
  \ HarrisHave Australia made a blunder by not picking the blue chip Harris? Only\
  \ time will tell. Nicknamed Rhino for his hulking figure and tear-apart approach,\
  \ Harris makes a formidable opening bowling pair with Mitchell Johnson, one many\
  \ openers would least like to face. Despite some impressive performance, Australian\
  \ selectors\u2019 weren\u2019t convinced that the 35 year olds injury prone body\
  \ would survive the toil of the World Cup. They appeared more interested in handing\
  \ him the ball for the upcoming Ashes.8-James NeeshamNew Zealand stirred a storm\
  \ by dropping James Neesham and picking the long forgotten Gant Elliot. The magnitude\
  \ of this jolt could only be matched with Pakistan\u2019s dragging of Sohail Khan\
  \ from international oblivion. The debate against Nasham raised the fact that his\
  \ best performances came in test matches and his replacement Elliot would bring\
  \ solidity to the batting line.9-Ajantha MendisThe maestro that gave us the mystery\
  \ \u201CCarrom Ball\u201D and is remembered best for tormenting the Indian Team.\
  \ He might not be as effective as the time he emerged, but still remains a lethal\
  \ force in the shorter formats where batsmen don\u2019t have much time to adjust\
  \ to his variations. He is one of the 6 players overlooked by the Islanders for\
  \ the Cup. This cut could eventually mean an end to his illustrious but often up\
  \ and down career.10-Saeed AjmalThe story of Ajmal is the saddest of the Cup. Had\
  \ it not been for the suspected arm action, Ajmal would have been the Hercules for\
  \ Pakistan. Baffled with fitness issues, Ajmal\u2019s emission could stretch the\
  \ cup further away from the Green Shirts. Always a lethal force to reckon with,\
  \ Ajmal has been re-structuring his action ever since English umpire Ian Gould brought\
  \ his action under the microscope.11-Umer GulGul, undoubtedly Pakistan\u2019s most\
  \ experience bowler has been battling with a long aggravating knee injury. Operated\
  \ in May, Gul was recalled for the series against Sri-Lanka where the pain resurfaced\
  \ and turned chronic during the New Zealand series. Gul has maintained that he is\
  \ fit for the highest level, but somehow failed to satisfy the selectors. The architect\
  \ of the 2009 T-20 triumph and countless memorable moments, the world\u2019s best\
  \ dearth bowler will surely be missed.Robin Peterson \u2013 12th Man. It would be\
  \ difficult for Robin Peterson to sit back and watch the happenings from back home,\
  \ having played three world cups, the handy spinner lost his place to Aron Phangiso."

  forms of malnutrition that include under five stunting and anaemia among women during
  the child bearing years.The first ever Global Nutrition Report that tracks the progress
  of 193 member countries of the United Nations in improving their nutrition status
  also identified Pakistan beginning to encounter the problem of adult obesity and
  related matters. The authors of the report launched at the 2nd International Conference
  on Nutrition (ICN2) have also assessed the progress against the six global World
  Health Assembly nutrition targets that include reducing child stunting and wasting
  anaemia in women of reproductive age and low birth weight preventing a worsening
  of child overweight and increasing exclusive breastfeeding of infants.With urban
  transition and changing lifestyles Pakistan is now facing a mixed pattern of malnutrition
  with high rates of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies among poor women
  and children as well as increasing rates of overweight and obesity among adults
  said Dr Zulfiqar Bhutta.The senior pediatrician and one of the authors of the report
  along with his colleagues had examined the impact on stunting and wasting in Bangladesh
  Ethiopia and Pakistan of scaling up coverage of key nutrition specific programmes
  plus interventions related to optimising birth intervals and improving water sanitation
  and hygiene. The results showed that by scaling up key interventions the model estimates
  reductions in the prevalence of stunting of 17 per cent 21 percent and 18 percent
  from 2013 to 2025 in Bangladesh Ethiopia and Pakistan respectively. Predicted reductions
  in the prevalence of severe wasting were estimated at 65 percent 62 percent and
  58 percent respectively.The impacts on severe wasting are particularly noteworthy
  whereas the estimated declines in stunting are modest and signal the need to increase
  both the coverage and quality of these interventions.Prof Zulfiqar Bhutta also the
  founding director of the Centre for Excellence in Women and Child Health at Aga
  Khan University said scientists and public health specialists at AKU are engaged
  in testing and implementing innovations and low cost solutions to address the problems
  of stunting and wasting among infants and children as well as adolescent girls in

  \ missing the first four matches. Coach Waqar Younis infected more dents by questioning\

  \ out invictus, reliving the true spirit of Imran Khan\u2019s Cornered Tiger, never\
  \ giving up, refusing to go down and fighting till the last breath.This is how we\
  \ know Sarfaraz Ahmed, the Cricket Warrior born and sharpened on the tough and rugged\
  \ streets of Karachi. A proud graduate of Rashid Latif\u2019s School of wicket-keeping\
  \ techniques and mental strength.But for anyone arguing that his performance was\
  \ just a one off spectacular, needs to revisit his battle-hardened attitude in whatever\
  \ little chances that came his way. At the 2012 Asia Cup final in Mirpur, he top\
  \ scored with a commanding 69 ball 46, including the crucial 13 in the final over\

  \ and out like an extra luggage piece, it was the year 2014 that gave Sarfaraz a\
  \ decent run and the Braveheart responded by maturing into a genuine match-winner.\
  \ He is the first Pakistani wicketkeeper to score three hundreds in one year.But\
  \ let\u2019s not forget that he is first a keeper and then anything else. In an\
  \ era when Pakistan Cricket has been hostage to the slips and misses of the Umar\
  \ Akmal Trilogy, its Sarfaraz\u2019s dependable glove work that has proved to be\
  \ a safe haven for Pakistani bowlers.Had he not been replaced, just imagine the\
  \ mess Akmal would have made off Hashim Amla\u2019s nudge.Like countless sad stories\
  \ of dumping and nepotism in Pakistan Cricket, Sarfaraz is no stranger to hardships\
  \ and baseless criticism. Often sidelined for unexplained reasons, the street fighter\
  \ has the habit of crawling his way back through some stellar performances.Some\
  \ circles scared of his skills and leadership qualities have discouraged and deliberately\
  \ tried to keep him out of the team. During a recent tour, his visa was purposely\
  \ delayed and a fellow keeper kept on telling him that he will be replacing Sarfaraz\
  \ on the tour. Sarfaraz eventually went on the tour, though he was dropped soon\
  \ afterwards without given right opportunities.Right after the 2012 Asia Cup, he\
  \ was dubbed as \u201CNot a good enough batsman\u201D and was dropped from the next\
  \ outing.A further shock came with him not being awarded the Central Contract.Expecting\
  \ Better from a CoachLet\u2019s admit it, Sarfaraz proved the Think Tank completely\
  \ wrong. In another setting, the Coach or captain would have erupted with joy and\
  \ shower laurels on his young gun, but remember this is Team Pakistan, where personal\
  \ egos have always been much larger than the game.There was no point in Waqar walking\
  \ alone for the press conference; honestly, he hadn\u2019t done much to deserve\
  \ a chat with the media about this feat (he puts Misbah to the cannons whenever\
  \ the team loses). His only right move was to let Sarfaraz play, but only after\
  \ facing ruthless criticism and shouldering some scratchy performances from his\
  \ beloveds.Rather, it was Sarfaraz\u2019s day, he had earned it. It was he who deserved\
  \ to pose a winning smile for the cameras. It was his feelings and experience that\
  \ were of interest to fans and media scribes around the world. Sadly, he was deprived\
  \ of the opportunity and Waqar engineered an unnecessary controversy.Interestingly,\
  \ Waqar has time and again accused Wasim Akram of sabotaging his carrier. It\u2019\
  s strange to see him handing the same treatment to the young and controversy free\
  \ Sarfaraz. Waqar needs to realise that like a boomerang thrown correctly, a deserving\
  \ player will only bring back the laurels to him.Hopefully, things will change for\
  \ Sarfaraz now.He has shown his toughness and lethality and expectations would be\
  \ high from him, but as the saying goes, \u201CWhen the going gets tough, the tough\
  \ get going\u201D. The fear of failure and being dropped again would keep pushing\

  tracking families from low-income backgrounds, promising them to get their daughters
  married and offering a handsome amount as well. Once the parents agree, they sell
  the women either in Afghanistan or within the country. The gang members have sold
  many Pakistani girls in Afghanistan or Afghan girls in Pakistan, by solemnising
  phone nikkah by a registrar, usually the prayer leader of a mosque, on a commission
  of Rs5,000 per nikkah.  An older adult woman, residing in Swabi, runs the gang s
  activities in Afghanistan. She takes the women with her to Jalalabad and sells them
  to Afghan agents. The gang keeps on changing their houses so as not be traced by
  anyone, one of the gang members told The News.     '

text: 'The equation for Pakistan is crystal clear, defeat the South Africans or go
  pack your bags. As the World Cup pool stage approaches its pointy end, both teams
  would look to pocket the all important 2 points, but for different reasons. South
  Africa, for a jab at the top slot, for Pakistan it s a question of survival.While
  fans would love to watch leather bang hard on willow, there are good chances that
  mother nature might step in at Auckland and spoil the fun with possible thundering
  showers.As the big hitters from both sides adjust their grips and the quickies tighten
  their spikes for the cut-through fixture, how about getting a bit nostalgic and
  re-collect some golden moments from days gone by?The Protease and Green shirts have
  fought their battles hard and given fans some memorable treats to cherish. From
  the first time they locked horns at the 92 Cup till the last arm-lock in Centurion,
  it s been all about pure passion, challenge and hunger for success. Keeping such
  history in mind, both teams are expected to produce a lot of bang and smoke on Saturday.Let
  s revisit some moments that refuse to leave our collections.1. Jhonty steals Inzi
  and the three Stumps   Crickets Superman hits the groundWe have all seen it hundreds
  of times and still never get tired of it, probably the most spectacular moment from
  a cricket field. The iconic image of the airborne Jhonty, horizontal to the last
  limb, flying through the air and defying laws of gravity to demolish all three stumps.
  A mind boggling stunt that would make even the legendary Christopher Reeve bite
  his fingers.The magical moment was captured by famed cricket photographer Patrick
  Eager and became a part of the games folklore. Jhonty recognition before the run
  out was limited to that of a struggling middle order batsman who wasn t contributing
  enough runs but would save 20 odd runs in fielding. But that one picture changed
  his existence.Ask him today and Jhonty is still unsure if it was his leap against
  gravity or the click of the camera that made him the poster boy of World Cricket.2.
  Waqar Younis 4-62 at Sharjah Cup Final   The return of the wounded TigerWhat a match
  for fans, what a match for Pakistan and what a match for Waqar Younis it was. Being
  thrashed by Australia in the tour Down under, Wasim Akram was dethroned from Captaincy
  and Pakistan came to play the Sharjah Cup under a new leader, Moin Khan.Waqar was
  kept on the side lines by Wasim and it was his time to hit back. Although he had
  a rocking tournament, but the Burewala Express kept his best for the finals against
  the mighty South Africans. Defending a total of 263, Waqar s middle order burst
  kept a check on the Protease and gave Moin Khan his first tournament win as a captain.And
  not to forget from the same match was Inzaman s cracking off drive that nearly blew
  Nantie Haywards head.3. Afridi s Flying Kiss to Jacque Kallis   Kallis Chaumma DedeAs
  the old saying goes, you can expect anything from Shahid Afridi, but here was an
  act as bizarre as it can get. It was the Semifinal of the T-20 WC at Nottingham,
  Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat. The last ball of the 4th over, Afridi
  wacked a short one from Kallis over wide midwicket for four.It was one of the hundreds
  of boundaries Afridi struck in his career, but what he did next caught every one
  off guard and astonished Kallis. Out of the blue, Afridi blew him a kiss but Kallis
  wasn t thrilled. This was tempting food for TV channels who did not miss a chance
  to milk out ratings. The foot tapping Amitabh hit  Jumma Chaumma Dede  blended perfectly
  and also generated thousand of hits on YouTube.4. Abdul Razzaq s rampant century
  at Abu DhabiPakistan had lost the first match and badly needed a win to bounce back
  in the series. Same was the case with Razzaq who was ping ponged in and out of the
  team. Chasing a target of 286, Pakistan were bruised at 5-136 when Razzaq took guard.
  It was the perfect setting for Razzaq who grabbed the opportunity with both hands
  and showered a 72 ball 109 that included 10 sixes and 7 fours. In his own words,
  this was the most memorable and fighting innings he ever played.5.Fanie de Villiers
  Cycling joy and Hansie Cronje s Tanga jockey funWe have all seem them; we have all
  lived through them. Pakistan has seen much better days then the ones currently flashed
  to the world. Foreign teams used to visit Pakistan multiple times every year, they
  used to play hard and rubbishing aside the cultural shock syndrome, used to merge
  and enjoy the tastes of Pakistan s rich and colorful culture. Every time Pakistan
  play their home series in UAE, the images of Fanie de Villiers enjoying his cycle
  ride in Faisalabad s Famous  Ghanta Ghar Chowk , or the Late Hansie Cronje hacking
  the Tanga at Rawalpindi s  Raja Bazar , remind of the golden days of Pakistan Cricket.
  The smile of their faces tells the complete story, how secure and welcomed they
  felt in the land of pure.Only South Africa can fell Pakistan s pain, they themselves
  suffered international isolation for 27 years and went through the painful apartheid
  segregation. Only they can realize the agony behind empty stands and dusty grounds.
  They have helped us before, they could again stretch their hands and allow Pakistani
  fans to make some noise in those empty stands.                                                         '

text: "Trump, Sanders ride US anti-establishment tide to New Hampshire win\nMANCHESTER,\
  \ N.H:\_Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders coasted to victory on\
  \ a wave of voter anger in the New Hampshire presidential nominating contest, thrashing\
  \ traditional U.S. politicians in a display of anti-establishment power.\nSweeping\
  \ wins by Trump, a New York billionaire, and Sanders, a democratic socialist, on\
  \ Tuesday testified to the sizable share of American voters upset at U.S. economic\
  \ conditions and willing to send a shockwave to Washington in the Nov. 8 presidential\
  \ election.\nNew Hampshire's verdict sets up a tough fight for Republicans in South\
  \ Carolina on Feb. 20 and for Democrats there on Feb. 27. Some of the most monumental\
  \ campaign battles in elections past have been fought in the state that holds the\
  \ first primary election of the American South.\nFor Trump, New Hampshire showed\
  \ he has staying power and can take a punch after losing on Feb. 1 to Texas Senator\
  \ Ted Cruz in the first contest, the Iowa caucuses. His win showed pundits were\
  \ wrong to think he would ultimately self-destruct based on his penchant for insults\
  \ and imprecise plans for the presidency.\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton, the former\
  \ U.S. secretary of state and former U.S. senator, now looks wounded, trailing Sanders\
  \ by 60 to 39 percent based on 86 percent of the returns.The wife of former President\
  \ Bill Clinton, Clinton barely won Iowa and now has been trounced in New Hampshire,\
  \ where young voters liked Sanders' populist proposals to break up big banks and\
  \ have the government pay for free college tuition.\n\u201CPeople have every right\
  \ to be angry but they\u2019re also hungry, they\u2019re hungry for solutions,\u201D\
  \ Clinton, 68, said after congratulating the 74-year-old Sanders. \"I will work\
  \ harder than anyone to actually make the changes that make your lives better.\"\
  \nClinton was headed to New York, home to her campaign headquarters, to regroup\
  \ with top aides and prepare for Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate. Her campaign\
  \ has denied reports it is considering a shakeup but acknowledged it would be natural\
  \ to add members to their team as the campaign progresses.\nSanders said his victory\
  \ showed \"we have sent the message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington,\
  \ from Maine to California, and that is that the government of our great country\
  \ belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\"\
  \nSome 73 percent of voters say they think the United States is on the wrong track,\
  \ and these disaffected people make up a majority of the support bases for Trump\
  \ and Sanders, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nThey are worried about the economy\
  \ and distrust establishment politicians they perceive as being part of the problem.\n\
  SHADOW-BOXING TRUMP\nTrump, 69, who has campaigned to deport illegal immigrants\
  \ and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States, was in first place\
  \ with 35 percent of the vote on the Republican side based on 88 percent of returns.\n\
  At his victory rally, Trump dispensed with niceties. He congratulated other candidates\
  \ in the race but promised to soon return to his pugnacious approach.\n\"Tomorrow:\
  \ boom, boom,\" he said, shadow boxing while his supporters cheered.\nThe New Hampshire\
  \ Republican race did little to clear up confusion about who would emerge as the\
  \ establishment contender to Trump on the Republican side.\nOhio's Republican governor,\
  \ John Kasich, won a spirited fight for second place in New Hampshire, with Cruz,\
  \ former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida fighting\
  \ for third place. All four were headed to South Carolina.\nBush, the son and brother\
  \ of former presidents, lived to fight another day, making something of a comeback\
  \ after a strong debate performance and solid weekend of campaigning.\n\u201CWhile\
  \ the reality TV star is doing well, it looks like you all have reset the race,\"\
  \ Bush told supporters. \"This campaign is not dead. We're going on to South Carolina.\"\
  \nRubio failed to dispatch Bush, seeing a drop in his support after a debate on\
  \ Saturday in which he drew criticism for repeating rehearsed lines from his stump\
  \ speech.\n\"I did not do well on Saturday night - listen to this: that will never\
  \ happen again,\" Rubio told supporters.\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who\
  \ called out Rubio for his robotic debate, fell behind the others in the voting\
  \ and canceled plans to go to South Carolina, a sign he could drop out soon.\nDISENCHANTED\
  \ VOTERS\nIndependent voters wield special clout in New Hampshire, second in the\
  \ series of state-by-state contests that lead to the parties' formal presidential\
  \ nominating conventions in July, because they can vote in either party's primary.\n\
  At a polling station in Manchester, Joan and Roland Martineau said they voted for\
  \ the two candidates they believed they could trust to shake things up.\nJoan, 68,\
  \ went for Sanders. \u201CI like this views, I like the way he speaks, I think I\
  \ can trust him,\u201D she said.\nRoland, 73, a registered Republican, went for\
  \ Trump, a man he said was \"more honest\" than other candidates. But he said he\
  \ would back Sanders over Trump in the general election in November.\nClinton had\
  \ for months been the front-runner nationally. But a Reuters/Ipsos poll done Feb\
  \ 2-5 showed Clinton and Sanders now in a dead heat.\nClinton campaign manager Robby\
  \ Mook said in a memo that the Democratic nomination would \"very likely\" be decided\
  \ in March, with the support of black and Hispanic voters key to victory. The next\
  \ primary races are in Nevada and South Carolina later this month.\n\"It will be\
  \ very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without\
  \ strong levels of support among African-American and Hispanic voters,\" Mook wrote."
