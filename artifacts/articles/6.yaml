text: "KP win Pakistan Cup\nKARACHI: Fakhar Zaman slammed a spectacular century to\
  \ help Khyber Pakhtunkhwa demolish Punjab by 151 runs in the final of Pakistan Cup\
  \ 2016 at Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad, on Sunday.\nIn the day-night decider, Fakhar\
  \ (115) and Ahmed Shehzad (62) gave a rapid start to enable KP to pile up 311-9\
  \ in the allotted 50 overs.\nSpinners Yasir Shah (3-26) and Zohaib Khan (3-23) then\
  \ bowled superbly to dismiss Punjab for 160 in 36.1 overs.\nKP had also lifted the\
  \ Pentangular Cup in January 2015 when they defeated Balochistan by six wickets\
  \ in the final under the captaincy of Junaid Khan in Karachi.\nThe Pakistan Cricket\
  \ Board (PCB) this season named this event as Pakistan Cup by making some changes.\n\
  Younis Khan won a vital toss and quite rightly elected to bat first on a pitch that\
  \ was full of runs.\nIn-form openers Shehzad (62) and Fakhar (115) provided an opening\
  \ stand of 118 in 15.4 overs.\nLeft-arm spinner Kashif Bhatti finally broke the\
  \ partnership when he had Shehzad stumped by Mohammad Rizwan. The decision was given\
  \ through a referral.\nShehzad, who seemed in elegant touch, smacked two sixes and\
  \ seven fours in his fiery 45-ball knock.\nShehzad finished the event as the highest\
  \ scorer with 372 runs, including three fifties and a superb 143.\nYounis promoted\
  \ left-handed all-rounder Zohaib Khan (12) in the batting order but he departed\
  \ early. Shoaib Malik had Zohaib caught at deep square-leg by Amad Butt when he\
  \ attempted a slog sweep.\nZohaib, who struggled against Malik, faced 27 deliveries.\n\
  Fakhar was held at short mid-on by substitute Asif Ali off Test pacer Ehsan Adil\
  \ after the Mardan-born player had cracked the fourth century of his career.\nFakhar\
  \ hit Shoaib for a four towards mid-off to complete his hundred. He struck three\
  \ huge sixes and 12 fours in his 111-ball feat. He ended the event as the second\
  \ highest scorer with 297 runs, which included one century and two fifties.\nFakhar\
  \ added 52 with Younis (49) for the third wicket.\nYounis and Fahim Ashraf (31)\
  \ added 57 for the fourth wicket before Ehsan dismissed the latter to leave KP at\
  \ 265-4 in 44 overs.\nFahim struck three fours and a six from 37 balls. Musadiq\
  \ Ahmed (19) used long handle, hitting two fours and one six in his rapid ten-ball\
  \ knock.\nYounis smacked one six from 59 balls before being caught by Shan Masood\
  \ off Amad as KP lost four wickets off the last 13 balls.\nYoung all-rounder Amad\
  \ was the pick of the bowlers with 3-55 in ten overs. Ehsan and Aamer Yamin remained\
  \ expensive with figures of 2-75 in ten overs and 1-49 in six, respectively.\nPunjab\
  \ had a poor start when left-arm pacer Zia-ul-Haq removed Salman Butt (0) and Aamer\
  \ (1) in quick succession to leave them at 29-2 in 7.2 overs.\nAsad Shafiq (16)\
  \ also fell early, held excellently by Fakhar at short-cover off the bowling of\
  \ Fahim. Asad struck three fours from 15 balls.\nLeft-arm spinner Mohammad Asghar\
  \ got the prized scalp of Shan Masood (36). Asghar tossed it up, it swung in sharply,\
  \ Shan went on back-foot to cut it, missed it completely before it crashed the stumps.\
  \ Shan hit five fours from 40 balls. Punjab were gasping at 55-4 in the 13th over.\n\
  Shoaib (24) and Rizwan (22) tried to consolidate the innings, but at 97, Test-leggie\
  \ Yasir Shah had the Punjab captain caught by Fahim in the deep. Malik smashed one\
  \ six and two fours from 26 deliveries.\nLeft-arm spinner Zohaib dislodged Rizwan\
  \ and Amad (0) in his first over to leave Punjab tottering at 107-7 in the 23rd\
  \ over.\nFahim took his third catch when he held Rizwan at point after the international\
  \ stumper had smacked two fours from 33 balls. Yasir removed Saif Badar (10).\n\
  Zulfiqar Babar (29) and Kashif Bhatti (15) extended KP\u2019s wait for celebration\
  \ as they added 36 for the ninth wicket before Zohaib sent back the former, trapped\
  \ lbw.\nZulfiqar struck two sixes and one four from 32 balls. Yasir completed the\
  \ rout when he had Ehsan (5) to fold Punjab.\nZia-ul-Haq got 2-25 in eight overs.\n\
  The winners KP received Rs2 million and a glittering trophy, while the runners-up\
  \ received Rs1 million and runners-up trophy.\nBesides, Rs100,000 each was handed\
  \ over to the best all-rounder Zohaib Khan (176 runs, 11 wickets), man of the match\
  \ Fakhar Zaman, best batsman Ahmed Shehzad (372 runs), best bowlers Mohammad Amir\
  \ (Sindh) and Zohaib Khan (11 wickets each).\nKP had brought in Younis Khan and\
  \ Musadiq Ahmed by dropping Adil Amin and Israrullah. Punjab did not make any change.\n\
  Ahsan Reza and Shozab Reza supervised the match. Asif Yaqoob acted as television\
  \ umpire, Khalid Mehmood as reserve umpire and Musaddiq Rasool as match referee.\n\
