text: "Pakistani bus driver\u2019s son Sadiq Khan becomes London Mayor\nLONDON: History\
  \ was made on Friday as son of Pakistani bus driver and Labour parliamentarian Sadiq\
  \ Khan defied all odds and won the race for London mayor, beating the government-supported\
  \ multi-billionaire Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith.\nSadiq Khan defeated Zac by 44\
  \ to 35 percent in the first preference votes and easily managed to win in the second\
  \ preferance.\nSpeaking after the official announcement of his victory, Khan said\
  \ he wanted a \u201Cmore equal London.\u201D\n\u201CI am so proud that Londoners\
  \ have today chosen hope over fear and unity over division,\u201D he added.\nThe\
  \ defeat of Zac Goldsmith at the hands of British Pakistani politician Sadiq Khan\
  \ is a huge personal setback for the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) chairman Imran\
  \ Khan who openly endorsed Zac Goldsmith and campaigned for his former brother-in-law\
  \ \u2013 Jemima Goldsmith\u2019s younger brother.\nIn an interview with Hamid Hamid\
  \ on Geo News, Imran Khan said that he was proud to support Zac Goldsmith because\
  \ he originally urged him to enter politics. The PTI leader then expressed his support\
  \ for Zac Goldsmith on 23rd of March on Twitter. Imran Khan told his followers:\
  \ \u201CZac Goldsmith is running for Mayor of London. Have known him for 20 years.\
  \ He is an honourable man with strong convictions and compassion. Zac is a man of\
  \ integrity with a commitment to justice. He has the leadership capabilities to\
  \ make a great mayor.\u201D\nImran Khan supported Zac Goldsmith because Zac has\
  \ always praised Imran Khan and told Geo News in an interview that \u201CImran Khan\
  \ is the answer to Pakistan\u2019s problem\u201D. He said that he considered himself\
  \ \u201Chalf Pakistani\u201D but then he went on to run a nasty campaign associating\
  \ Muslims with terrorism and incorrectly calling Sadiq Khan an extremist, radical\
  \ and terror sympathiser.\nWhen asked by this correspondent about Imran Khan\u2019\
  s support for Zac Goldsmith, Sadiq Khan, while laughing, said that \u201Cit\u2019\
  s a blessing that Imran Khan doesn\u2019t have a vote in London\u201D. Sadiq Khan\
  \ said that extremely negative campaign was run against him by Zac Goldsmith and\
  \ the Tory government but he said that he has always believed in \u201Chope against\
  \ fear and division\u201D. He said that\nZac attacked Sadiq Khan using race and\
  \ religion card to such an extent that his own party\u2019s former cabinet minister\
  \ and party chair Sayeeda Warsi said that Zac Goldsmith had become unrecognisable\
  \ to her and that his campaign team was \u201Cdestroying\u201D him through attacks\
  \ on Muslims.\nSadiq Khan told this scribe that he will be a mayor of all lonoders\
  \ and will serve diligently. he said that he will use his tenure to try to improve\
  \ trade relations between pakistan and the UK.\nMillions of Pounds were spent by\
  \ the Tory campaign on telling voters that Sadiq Khan was a Pakistani, Muslim, terror\
  \ sympathiser and hence he should not be trusted.\nZac Goldsmith was supported by\
  \ Prime Minister David Cameron as the duo joined forced and used every trick in\
  \ the book to defame Sadiq Khan to scare off voters, including attacks on Sadiq\
  \ Khan during live transmission on the state television.\nDavid Cameron at the prime\
  \ minister\u2019s questions time by saying Labour\u2019s mayoral candidate Tooting\
  \ MP Sadiq Khan had appeared on platforms with a London imam who \u201Csupports\
  \ IS\u201D (Islamic State).\nThis was despite the imam in question, Suliman Gani,\
  \ having already said on Twitter that he had attended a political event with Conservative\
  \ candidate Zac Goldsmith and had supported the local Tory challenger to Khan at\
  \ the general election.\nIt turned out that Gani had appeared with Zac Goldsmith\
  \ on many occasions and the two were pictured together. Gani said that he backed\
  \ the party\u2019s candidate Dan Watkins last May and even supplied canvassers for\
  \ his campaign. He added that, following the election, the Tories had asked him\
  \ to help them find potential local councillors. He said he felt he had been used\
  \ by the Conservatives \u201Cas a scapegoat to discredit Sadiq Khan.\u201D\nZac\
  \ Goldsmith\u2019s campaign in English areas told voters that Sadiq Khan was a Muslim\
  \ and he must not be given votes; In Indian community areas, Zac\u2019s campaign\
  \ team said that Sadiq was of Pakistani heritage, that he was a Muslim and didn\u2019\
  t support Narendra Modi when he last visited London, they also circulated a picture\
  \ of Zac with Modi and Pm Cameron, they also told Indians that their jewellery will\
  \ not be safe if Sadiq Khan wins; In Jewish areas similar campaign of fear and division\
  \ was run.\nAndrew Boff, Tory leader in the Greater London Assembly and Zac\u2019\
  s colleague, blasted Zac Goldsmith for doing \"real damage\" to community relations.\
  \ He said Zac Goldsmith has \"blown up bridges\" by linking Labour's Sadiq Khan\
  \ with Muslim \"extremists\".\nAndrew Boff said it was an error to \"equate people\
  \ of conservative religious views with sympathising with terrorism\".He said:\_\
  \ Mr Boff, the former Conservative group leader on the London Assembly, told the\
  \ BBC: \"I mentioned that I thought this was a mistake for future integration in\
  \ London. I don't think it was dog whistle because you can't hear a dog whistle\
  \ - everybody could hear this.\nIt was effectively saying that people of conservative\
  \ religious views are not to be trusted and you shouldn't share a platform with\
  \ them. That's outrageous.\"\nSadiq Khan has previously said he had \"never hidden\"\
  \ the fact that, as a former chairman of Liberty and a human rights lawyer, he had\
  \ acted for \"some pretty unsavoury characters\".\nMr Boff said the party had actively\
  \ engaged with the Muslim community in Newham, but \"now those bridges that have\
  \ been built, a few of them have been blown up by this campaign\"."
