text: "Cancer on the rise among children in underprivileged areas of Pakistan\nKarachi:\
  \ An increasing number of cancer cases are being reported among children from low-income\
  \ localities of Pakistan, as per a study conducted by paediatric oncologists at\
  \ the National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Karachi, which cites adverse environmental\
  \ conditions, unhygienic living conditions, consumption of unsafe drinking water\
  \ and malnourishment as possible causes.\_\n\u201CPoor quality of life due to deteriorating\
  \ environmental conditions and unhygienic lifestyle is causing frequent infections\
  \ to a vast majority of Pakistani children. Combined with the malnourishment, these\
  \ infections are resulting in causing various types of cancers to children,\u201D\
  \ said Professor Nizam-ul-Hassan, former director NICH and president of the Child\
  \ Aid Foundation (CAA), a non-profit organisation which runs the cancer treatment\
  \ at the NICH with doctors and philanthropists.\nTalking to The News, he said there\
  \ was no public sector cancer treatment facility in Karachi or even in the entire\
  \ Sindh and Balochistan, and the whole burden of cancer treatment was borne by NGOs\
  \ and associations like the CAA, the Children Cancer Hospital and some other private\
  \ hospitals, including the Aga Khan University Hospital.\nAccording to him, a group\
  \ of Pakistani doctors, including NICH former director Prof Nizamul Hasan, started\
  \ the cancer treatment at the Children Hospital Karachi in April 1999 and since\
  \ then thousands of cancer patients have completely been cured by the qualified\
  \ and trained oncologists and paramedics.\n\u201CAround 50 to 60 children suffering\
  \ from cancers are brought at our OPD everyday, of which 50 percent are new patients.\
  \ Around 300 patients are receiving chemotherapy with various types of cancers,\
  \ including Retinoblastomas, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemias and Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas\u201D\
  , he claimed, adding that the inpatient capacity of the facility was just 14 patients\
  \ due to space constraints.\nWhile quoting pediatric oncologists, he said the worst\
  \ environmental and hygienic conditions at low-income group localities in Pakistan\
  \ were some of the major reasons behind frequent infections, including diarrhea\
  \ and gastroenteritis among children, which was the leading cause of solid tumors\
  \ or blood cancers to them.\nProf Nizam said although the study had yet to be published\
  \ but the observations of the pediatric oncologists led to similar direction, saying\
  \ childhood cancer was on the rise among children of low-income group people, who\
  \ used to live in areas with extremely poor environmental and hygienic conditions,\
  \ having no or low vaccination status and suffered infections on multiple occasions\
  \ in a short span of time.\nTo a query, he said the centre had a team of pediatric\
  \ oncologists, led by Dr Uzma Imam and paramedical staff, who had been trained by\
  \ German pediatric oncologists and paramedics in 2005-06, adding that renowned Pakistani\
  \ pediatric oncologists practicing in US and UK often visit their centre and offered\
  \ their assistance and advice in treatment of patients.\n\u2018Malnourished patients\u2019\
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\n\u201CDuring the last several years, almost 40 percent children brought\
  \ to the NICH with various types of cancers were malnourished and due to low immunity,\
  \ their chances of having cancer increased\u201D, Prof Nizam further said.\nIn addition\
  \ to fighting cancer, he said, doctors and paramedics had to take care of the nutritional\
  \ status of the patients so that their bodies could fight the lethal disease like\
  \ cancers.\nHe further said malnourishment was on the rise among children of low-income\
  \ segments and it was resulting in spreading cancer and other lethal infections.\n\
  \u201CA group of German doctors and nurses, who trained our staff, emphasised on\
  \ improving nutritional status of children with cancers, since a child could not\
  \ fight cancer without having enough nutrition.\u201D\nThe professor said the centre\
  \ was providing highly enriched food supplements in addition to milk and dates to\
  \ cancer patients as most of the patients suffering from cancers were highly fragile\
  \ and underweight due to malnourishment.\n\u2018Eye cancers on the rise\u2019\n\
  Eye cancers, also known as retinoblastomas, are on the rise among Pakistani children\
  \ being brought from rural parts of Sindh, Balochistan and lower Punjab, according\
  \ to Prof Nizam claimed.\nHe said doctors were trying to understand the sudden rise\
  \ in eye cancers which render the patient blind at an early age if not treated at\
  \ the early stages.\nHe said the most common causes of the eye cancers were due\
  \ to genetic reasons, but because of\_ sudden increase in the number of children\
  \ with retinoblastomas, experts at the cancer treatment facility were worried and\
  \ trying to understand the phenomenon.\n\u2018Short of space at centre\u2019\nDespite\
  \ spending Rs600 million annually, the cancer treatment facility at the NICH caters\
  \ to only a few thousand patients annually as only 300 can be given chemotherapy,\
  \ while only 14 can be admitted at the center at a time, according to Prof Nizam\
  \ said.\n\u201CWe are facing a shortage of space due to growing number of patients\
  \ being brought to them from across the country.\n\u201CWe are ready to generate\
  \ double the amount we are spending currently on treatment of children if we are\
  \ provided with ample space to admit more patients. A building at the NICH back\
  \ was supposed to be given to us after its completion, but even after passage of\
  \ a decade, it has not yet been constructed, even after the devolution process\u201D\
  , he said.\nHe urged the provincial government to release funds for the construction\
  \ of the building at the NICH so that more patients with cancers could be treated."
