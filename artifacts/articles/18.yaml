text: "Guest of Honour status for Pakistan at China\u2019s International Import Expo\n\
  \nBEIJING: The Chinese government has granted the status of \"Guest of Honor\" to\
  \ Pakistan at the China International Import Expo (CIIE) to be held from November\
  \ 5 to 10. This will ensure the provision of all possible facilities and benefits\
  \ to the Pakistani pavilion.The gesture also shows the level of commitment in China\
  \ to make Pakistan part of a shared future, according to an article published by\
  \ Global Times here on Monday.The expo offers a chance for global manufacturers\
  \ and producers to showcase their products in order to gain access to China's market.The\
  \ expo is also an opening for countries participating in the Belt and Road (B&R)\
  \ initiative to boost their infrastructure upgrading and reach wider markets.Pakistan\
  \ is one such country, which is undergoing massive infrastructure development to\
  \ align itself with global transportation and communication networks.The China-Pakistan\
  \ Economic Corridor (CPEC) will create an advanced network of roads, railways and\
  \ a deep-sea port that will boost trade with China, Central Asia and Europe.China\u2019\
  s demand for imported food has been growing steadily, creating a market worth $58.28\
  \ billion last year, a 25 percent increase year-on-year.Pakistan, on the other hand,\
  \ has a largely agrarian economy.With the help of Chinese scientists, local agriculture\
  \ specialists have successfully introduced modern farming techniques.Hybrid rice\
  \ and hybrid wheat have been the most successful products, seeing a marked increase\
  \ in yield.Meanwhile, Pakistani mangoes are also doing well; 10,000 tons of them\
  \ are expected to be exported to China by the end of this year.To take advantage\
  \ of China''s food market, Pakistani producers at the CIIE can offer their own unique\
  \ and cost-effective products.A bigger share of the market in China would translate\
  \ into higher revenues, improved quality and a wider product range.Apart from food,\
  \ there are other Pakistani products with immense potential for export to China,\
  \ including onyx stones, minerals and surgical items.The expo organizers were initially\
  \ expecting around 150,000 purchasing agents, but they have so far registered over\
  \ 160,000. This massive participation will present Pakistan with access to markets\
  \ in other countries as well.As foreign buyers experience the previously unexplored\
  \ Pakistani prospects, new windows of trade will open.Thus, Pakistani businesses\
  \ will expand not just into China, but also internationally.Starting from the port\
  \ of Shanghai, China is rolling out assistance for B&R countries to bring down their\
  \ trade costs.The cargo clearance process has been simplified and a new filing mechanism\
  \ is being built for the CIIE pavilions of these countries.China is also adjusting\
  \ tariffs on certain products, such as nuts from Pakistan, in order to meet the\
  \ demand among domestic consumers.As a follow-up step to the import expo, Pakistani\
  \ manufacturers can take advantage of China's booming e-commerce sector.They can\
  \ utilize this highly developed industry to reach out to more customers than would\
  \ be possible only with physical stores in China.Alibaba Group has acquired Pakistan's\
  \ largest e-commerce portal and its payment arm Alipay is planning to enter the\
  \ Pakistani market this year.These ventures will help local manufacturers export\
  \ goods to China while letting the supply chain infrastructure, which is already\
  \ maturing under the CPEC and B&R initiative, do its job.Pakistan and China are\
  \ developing stronger ties in the rapidly evolving global order."
