text: "Breathing space for smooth transition: China loans Pakistan $1.5 to $1.7\n\
  ISLAMABAD: In a bid to get a breathing space for Pakistan for completion of ongoing\
  \ political transition in a smooth manner, China has provided $1.5 to $1.7 billion\
  \ in shape of official bilateral loan on soft terms and conditions to Islamabad\
  \ out of total agreed size of $2 billion assistance.The remaining small amount of\
  \ this soft loan will be deposited into the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) very soon,\
  \ a top official confirmed to The News on Saturday.However, economic experts believe\
  \ this bilateral assistance from China cannot become alternative to the IMF program\
  \ keeping in view the projected financing gap in the range of $26 to $28 billion\
  \ for the current fiscal year 2018-19.In his maiden speech after winning election,\
  \ PTI chief Imran Khan dwelt upon certain issues relating to economy such as taxation\
  \ and austerity to reduce expenditure but he did not mention this huge financing\
  \ gap of $28 billion which is the biggest economic problem for Pakistan right now.But\
  \ one former bureaucrat who has dealt with economic ministries for his whole carrier,\
  \ suggested to the incoming government led by Imran Khan that they must give one\
  \ chance to existing tax amnesty scheme by extending it for one month with the hope\
  \ that the new administration having no baggage might lead people to convince for\
  \ benefitting from this scheme while living abroad and Pakistan might get the desired\
  \ $3 to $4 billion inflows on immediate basis.\u201CThis can be a great start for\
  \ the new government\u201D, he told this reporter on the condition of anonymity.He\
  \ said in such case Pakistan might be able to avoid the IMF program.Imran Khan also\
  \ met with Saudi Ambassador in Islamabad which also raised hopes that the Kingdom\
  \ might provide few billion dollars as a sign of good gesture for the new government\
  \ as Riyadh had provided $1.5 billion to the PML-N-led government in 2014 as a gift.When\
  \ contacted former finance minister and renowned economist Dr Hafiz Pasha on Saturday,\
  \ he said Pakistan\u2019s financing gap on external front was projected at $28 billion\
  \ for the current fiscal year and the incoming government will have to place a comprehensive\
  \ strategy to bridge this gap.He said China had provided over $6.5 billion on different\
  \ accounts to Pakistan in last fiscal year and again agreed to provide $2 billion\
  \ more in this fiscal year but it could be used as \u201Cbreathing space\u201D only.\u201C\
  We can meet around 40 percent financing requirement with help of China but we will\
  \ have to manage remaining 60 percent from other avenues,\u201D he added.If the\
  \ foreign currency reserves continued to fall and remain two months below import\
  \ bill then the multilateral creditors such as the World Bank, ADB and others would\
  \ not provide assistance for budgetary support so the IMF support will become necessary\
  \ in such situation.As The News had already broken a story regarding a proposal\
  \ under consideration to increase additional customs duty by one percent on almost\
  \ all items and jacking up Regulatory Duty (RD) on luxury items before July 25 elections\
  \ so now the next government will have to take such tough steps in a bid to reduce\
  \ the rising trade and current account deficit on immediate basis.The imports of\
  \ the country had peaked to $56 billion so there is need to discourage such mammoth\
  \ number of imports.The current account deficit stood at $18 billion for last fiscal\
  \ year ended on June 30, 2018 which required to reduce mainly through increasing\
  \ dollar inflows in shape of boosting exports, remittances and investment and decreasing\
  \ imports."
