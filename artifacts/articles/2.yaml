  \ Lakhani\_\nWith a clear statistical edge over Bangladesh, Pakistan cricket team\
  \ is set to launch its World T20 mission with the aim of improving their record\
  \ against Bangladeshis on Wednesday.\nThe current form may not be in Pakistan\u2019\
  s favour as they have lost last two of their 9 T20Is against Bangladesh, but they\u2019\
  ve won all the 7 games played before the last two.\nPakistan\u2019s Shahid Afridi\
  \ is the only player to have played all Pakistan vs Bangladesh T20Is, scoring 132\
  \ runs with an average of 16.50 and taking 8 wickets at an average of 26.\nTalking\
  \ about recent form, Pakistan have won only three of its last 10 Twenty20 internationals,\
  \ while Bangladesh came out successful in six of its last 10 completed T20Is.\n\
  This will be the 5th time that Pakistan and Bangladesh face each other in a World\
  \ T20 match, jointly most by a pair of opponents along with the opposing pair of\
  \ Sri Lanka and West Indies.\nPakistan has an unbeaten run against Bangladesh in\
  \ World T20 competitions, the men in green have won all previous World T20 games\
  \ against Bangladesh (in 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2014)\nAmong the batsmen from both\
  \ the teams, Shakib Al Hassan is leading scorer in all Pakistan vs Bangladesh games,\
  \ with 242 runs in 8 innings. Pakistan\u2019s Shoaib Malik added 135 T20I runs to\
  \ his tally of runs from 7 games against Bangladesh.\nIn bowling, Pakistan\u2019\
  s Shahid Afridi is leading wicket taker in all matches, having 8 wickets to his\
  \ credit in 9 games. Abdul Razzak of Bangladesh has grabbed 7 wickets in 7 games\
  \ against Pakistan.\nTamim Iqbal of Bangladesh is the leading run scorer from the\
  \ qualifying stage of WorldT20 this year, with 233 runs off 147 balls and being\
  \ dismissed just once in three innings."
