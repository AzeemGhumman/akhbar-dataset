text: "Russia says Afghanistan talks postponed\n\nMoscow: Russia said on Monday that\
  \ international peace talks on Afghanistan have been postponed following a phone\
  \ conversation between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Afghan leader Ashraf Ghani.Moscow\
  \ had been preparing to host peace talks on September 4 and had invited Taliban\
  \ representatives to participate.The Russian foreign ministry said that Ghani had\
  \ \"in principle\" supported the idea of such a meeting but said Afghanistan needed\
  \ more time to develop a \"consolidated\" position including ongoing changes in\
  \ the government.\"An agreement was reached to jointly work on a new date of the\
  \ meeting through diplomatic channels,\" the ministry said in a statement.The Afghan\
  \ government faces fierce criticism over an increasingly deadly insurgency.On Sunday\
  \ Ghani rejected the resignations of the intelligence chief and the interior and\
  \ defence ministers, demanding they help bolster the country\xB4s defences.Earlier\
  \ this month Ghani offered a conditional three-month ceasefire to the Taliban, a\
  \ move welcomed by the United States and NATO after nearly 17 years of war.Zamir\
  \ Kabulov, special representative of the Russian president on Afghanistan, had earlier\
  \ said the talks would be \"in the framework of launching a process of national\
  \ reconciliation in Afghanistan\".In April 2017, Moscow hosted an international\
  \ conference on Afghanistan with representatives from Afghanistan, India, Iran,\
  \ China, Pakistan, and five former Soviet republics in Central Asia.The US was invited\
  \ to that meeting but did not participate.Russia and its allies called on the Taliban\
  \ to lay down weapons and negotiate with the Afghan government directly. Moscow\
  \ also declared its readiness to serve as a platform for dialogue."
