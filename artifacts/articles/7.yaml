text: "Facebook likely be the publisher of everything, says Prof Craig Duff\nThe News\
  \ International got an opportunity to have a Q & A with Prof Craig Duff - an award-winning\
  \ video journalist and television documentary director, producer and writer, specializing\
  \ in multi-platform storytelling and solo journalism.\nDuff was the director of\
  \ multimedia and chief video journalist for TIME, where he oversaw video and other\
  \ multimedia projects for the magazine\u2019s digital platforms and TIME.com.\n\
  He is the focal person on a US-funded project to establish a journalism school at\
  \ the IBA in partnership with Medill and the ICFJ.What prospects moved Medill to\
  \ partner with a Pakistani institution to establish a world class journalism institute?\
  \ How did you become part of it?\nDr. Lawrence Pintak, who is founding dean of \u201C\
  The Edward R. Murrow College of Communication\u201D at Washington State University\
  \ was based in Cairo some years ago running a centre very similar to what we\u2019\
  re building here called the \u201CKamal Adham Center for Journalism Training and\
  \ Research\u201D at The American University. Larry worked to sort out and gauge\
  \ the needs and interests of journalists and editors and media corporations here,\
  \ and what the issues are and what was needed for training under a US funded project\
  \ for establishing a journalism school. Then we bid on the project and were chosen\
  \ for the grant. So I knew that was happening and when the ICFJ wanted to bid on\
  \ it they needed to find a partner school so they called me because I knew everybody\
  \ basically in the whole chain. I had worked with Larry in Cairo at the Adham Centre,\
  \ and I got involved in this because I know the people who wrote the proposal for\
  \ the US government.\nWhat\u2019s the structure of CEJ-Medill partnership; can we\
  \ say that CEJ would be a replica of Medill?\nWe are really trying to create something\
  \ more permanent so our people won\u2019t be involved and we\u2019re going to help\
  \ train people who will carry it forward. So we\u2019re hoping that some people\
  \ will come through our programme in Chicago after that we\u2019ll train those folks\
  \ and they\u2019ll come and be the faculty.\nYou have conducted a successful training\
  \ session with local journalists; what\u2019s your observation?\nMy only experience\
  \ was the two-week \u201CBackpack/Mobile Multimedia Training\u201D course back in\
  \ October 2014 and I think this was the most rewarding international training experience\
  \ I\u2019ve ever had. Everyone who has come back from teaching here has had an extraordinary\
  \ experience and the key things they say are the eagerness among the people who\
  \ are attending to learn, to think differently about journalism. Our impact is only\
  \ measured by what happens once we leave if people apply what they\u2019ve learned\
  \ and started doing it. And it\u2019s great when you see that happening. The institute\
  \ is going to have the facility that will have a working studio and editing facilities\
  \ so they\u2019ll be able to train pretty much any technology here.\nWhat are the\
  \ dos and don\u2019ts for a journalist?\nIn television we don\u2019t set anything\
  \ up, you don\u2019t ask someone to repeat something so you can get a shot of it;\
  \ when you try to be in a place where things are happening and you get the shot\
  \ but you don\u2019t say \u2018could you fire that rifle again please so I can get\
  \ a better shot or I can get a better angle\u2019. We try not to stage things. But\
  \ that is pretty common in TV here.You have to be honest with your audience.\nHow\
  \ do you think electronic media has impacted the print media?\nNow, the newspaper\
  \ has to figure out ways to serve their readers what they\u2019ve already heard\
  \ the news on TV. They have to think of different ways of telling stories and giving\
  \ something else, something extra - an analysis or a context to the story.\nYou\
  \ arranged a student exchange program last year, how do you think such exchanges\
  \ are going to bring professionals closer?\nI think any time two people from two\
  \ cultures get together and work together you are going to have something interesting\
  \ happen and people will learn from each other. That\u2019s always good.\nIn today\u2019\
  s world, technology is changing the way we consume media; where are we heading?\n\
  Just look at the amount of change that has happened over your lifetime in terms\
  \ of how things were produced. It is extraordinary for me to think that I can shoot\
  \ something on mobile, edit it and bring it on my laptop. Pace of things happening\
  \ is so much faster in the past two years that who is to say that in five years\
  \ what we will be doing.\nRight now the big emphasis in news has really been about\
  \ this (mobile) device, not necessarily to record news but to play it or to view\
  \ it. And mobile is basically is how a lot of us in the west are getting our news\
  \ now \u2013 we are all getting hunched now sort of watching this thing all the\
  \ time. So social media is driving it, so that is a huge change in the past few\
  \ years as away from the web to mobile and now mobile is the big focus. Who is to\
  \ say what is going to happen next? It\u2019s probably going to be something portable\
  \ and something very easy for someone to see \u2013 but it has changed our habits\
  \ of how we consume news. I would say the web page homepage doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ anymore for the New York Times or Times magazine because no one goes there, Facebook\
  \ is the new homepage. Earlier, journalists acted as watchdog and decide what should\
  \ masses know but now with growing influence of reader\u2019s feedback we are witnessing\
  \ a reverse trend and journalists now focus on what people want to read\nIt\u2019\
  s sort of a double-edged sword because it is great to have feedback and you understand\
  \ where the viewers are reading by their comments. I think the watchdog role (of\
  \ media) is the very bedrock of journalism that we are there to serve a purpose\
  \ to keep those in power from doing crazy things or to at least make sure that there\
  \ is a check on power and it\u2019s a vital role.\nSocial media companies are taking\
  \ over the publisher\u2019s space and business too, how it\u2019s going to affect\
  \ media outlets?\nFacebook I think will like to be the publisher of everything and\
  \ be the only source of where people get stuff. So software companies are trying\
  \ to become the new publishers and they have a lot of power as they have the audience.\
  \ They\u2019ve already got partnerships with NY Times and National Geographic and\
  \ some others to publish directly. And we\u2019ll see where that goes. The thing\
  \ is that Facebook is only 12 years old who is to say in five years this is going\
  \ to be the biggest technology or software or whatever company surges ahead of them.\n\
