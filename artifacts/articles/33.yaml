text: "Pakistan\u2019s first animated film \u20183 Bahadur\u2019 premieres in Karachi\
  \   \n\n\n                        KARACHI: There are three kids in town who will\
  \ not yield to forces of evil and darkness that have forced the residents of Roshan\
  \ Basti into submission, unleashing a reign of terror through hired thugs. That\
  \ in short is a plot of Pakistan\u2019s first animated featured film \u201C3 Bahadur\u201D\
  , directed by Oscar winner Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy.Set in a fictional town, the film\
  \ tells the story of three school going children who stand up to Baba Balaam, his\
  \ disciple Mangu and their hired thugs.Having shown their courage in the face of\
  \ tyranny, Amna, Saadi and Kamil are given superpowers before they set out to put\
  \ an end to the injustice that has turned their Roshan Basti into Andher Nagri.Deenu,\
  \ voiced by Behroz Sabzwari, while bestowing superpowers on the three children,\
  \ advises them not to rely merely on their powers but invoke their wisdom as well\
  \ to undo the forces of evil.\u201CYou don\u2019t need to be a superhero. You are\
  \ a superhero,\u201D said Sharmeen Obaid  at the premiere of the film in Nueplex\
  \ Cinemas Karachi.She said: \u201C3 Bahadur is not just a movie. It is a movement.\
  \ We can face the challenges, like the three characters of the film\u201D.The film\
  \ that is slated for countrywide release on May 22, saw a roaring response at the\
  \ premiere that was held Tuesday. Humayun Saeed, Behroz Sabzwari, Saud, Ayesha Umar,\
  \ and many other film and drama stars attended the premiere show.Taciturn Saadi,\
  \ talkative Kamil and courageous Amna have everything to entertain the viewers who\
  \ have yet to watch the first Pakistani animated output.Sharmeen, who won an Academy\
  \ Award for her documentary, Saving Face in 2012 and became the first Pakistani\
  \ to win an Oscar, is the director and producer of \"3 Bahadur\"."
